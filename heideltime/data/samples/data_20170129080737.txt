November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2810","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Grenfell","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Grenfell Record","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"270688924","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Grenfell Record","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.grenfellrecord.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196054549","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n\nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen.

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

Median became the equivalent of a four-letter word back when the city proposed them for upper McCulloch Boulevard and some of that emotional baggage remains. \n   \nTruthfully, medians are not that big of a deal. Few complain about them, for example, on other commercial sections of McCulloch Boulevard. \n   \nMedians that limit left turns from Lake Havasu Avenue may help reduce accidents and help with overall traffic flow, allowing more green light time for those moving through that congested stretch of traffic signals. \n   \nFor the plan to work optimally, it needs to be done in conjunction with the Arizona Department of Transportation, which controls State Route 95 and its traffic signals. The timing of those signals, a bane to residents and visitors who simply want to get from one side of town to another, must be improved to work with the changing traffic flow. \n   \nThe highway and Lake Havasu Avenue are the two main and most direct thoroughfares connecting northern and southern parts of the city. An increase in traffic and traffic signals produces several traffic bottlenecks, the most pronounced of which are in the area between Mesquite and Swanson avenues. \n   \nThe tone for the congested areas is set by the timing of signals further north and south, including the confusing and maddening mess where Mulberry Avenue intersects the highway. \n   \nThe entire highway needs better signal synchronization. \n   \nThe Mulberry mess may require more than that. It may need an overpass to connect traffic on Lake Havasu Avenue and the highway. \n   \nNone of them would be improved with traffic circles, which we mention only because they seem to be ADOT\u2019s currently preferred option for traffic control elsewhere. \n   \nIn considering the Lake Havasu Avenue medians, the city may wish to do the project in a way that can be easily undone when, not if, future traffic needs warrant more reconfiguration. To that end, minimal-width median barriers with \u201cno left turn\u201d signs may be enough to address immediate needs. \n   \nThe purpose of roads is to move traffic. If some median work helps, great. The project needs to be cost effective. It must anticipate the disruption, especially including the extra north-south traffic that will use the highway during the construction. ADOT needs to be a prime partner and must arrange highway signals to efficiently move the extra traffic. \n   \n\u2014 Today\u2019s News-Herald","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Advertising industry news","group":"Media"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Our View: Median may help, but it won\u2019t alone solve traffic issue","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Mohave","zipCode":"86403","state":"Arizona","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lake Havasu City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Havasu News-Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169752151","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"172"},"name":"Havasu News-Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.havasunews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196061349","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A little too tight for some. \n   \nLake Havasu City Magistrate Mitch Kalauli said the court has maxed out its current 20,000 square feet of space and will need to double its size if Havasu\u2019s population continues to increase. \n   \n\u201cIt\u2019s not that the court is reaching capacity - we\u2019ve already reached it,\u201d Kalauli said. \n   \nAt a meeting with city officials earlier this month, Kalauli laid out the numerous challenges Havasu\u2019s consolidated court faces including a lack of space for files, lagging IT services and security concerns. During comments, Lake Havasu City Council member Donna Brister-McCoy said the court\u2019s situation was \u2018deplorable.\u2019 \n   \nKalauli said frustration stems in part from the \u2018extremely inefficient\u2019 case management system created by the state that requires clerks to process all payments by hand and retain paper records. Kalauli estimated it takes more than 6,000 hours, or three clerks working full time, just to locate and complete the paperwork each year. A new system the state is working on isn\u2019t expected to reach Havasu\u2019s Consolidated Court for another three to five years, he said. \n   \n\u201cBy the time it rolls out to us it would also be a legacy system and be obsolete. We\u2019re really frustrated with our inability to move forward, especially as we see what\u2019s happening with the city,\u201d Kalauli said. \u201cI mean, the city is at the forefront of what\u2019s going on technologically and we can\u2019t adjust to that.\u201d \n   \nThat files have jammed up the court\u2019s already limited storage space, which was reduced to make room for a new courtroom. As a result, for the past five years, files have been accumulating in hallways, where some members of the public can access them. \n   \n\u201cOur jury deliberation rooms are back here, so members of the public do have access to this area,\u201d Court Administrator Jennifer Harrold said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re unsupervised, but it\u2019s still a concern.\u201d \n   \nShe said the court is not aware of any missing or tampered-with files. \n   \nWorkspace is also maxed out. Harrold said there\u2019s no growth potential to hire more employees at its current facility. \n   \n\u201cLuckily I have a great staff who do the best with what they have. We\u2019ve become really close as a group,\u201d she said. \n   \nLooking ahead \n   \nThe consolidated court functions under an agreement between Lake Havasu City and Mohave County. Both entities help fund the court, but the State Supreme Court determines the court\u2019s management practices. \n   \nKalauli asked city officials to consider reassessing its longstanding agreement with the county in order to provide more immediate services and also to begin planning for more courthouse space. \n   \nLake Havasu City Mayor Mark Nexsen said he\u2019s willing to help, but it will have to be a joint effort. \n   \n\u201cI really think it\u2019s beneficial for the city and county to work together to find a solution to these issues that affect everybody that\u2019s in that courthouse, and if the three cities - Kingman, Bullhead and Lake Havasu - can come together and save taxpayers money like we have in the past, why can\u2019t the county and city do the same?\u201d Nexsen said. \n   \nCounty Supervisor Steve Moss said he hasn\u2019t received any formal requests from the court, which is in his district, but said the board would be open to hearing proposals. \n   \n\u201cI\u2019m sure if it were to be brought up to the Board [of Supervisors], they would be very sympathetic,\u201d Moss said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Advertising industry news","group":"Media"}],"title":"Havasu courthouse too cramped","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Mohave","zipCode":"86403","state":"Arizona","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lake Havasu City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Havasu News-Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169752151","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"172"},"name":"Havasu News-Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.havasunews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196061521","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Ann Rodriguez said Friday the letter shows recorders are fed up with dictates from Spencer. \n   \nReagan \u201cis kind of disconnected and kind of left it with staff,\u201d and now \u201cneeds to engage\u201d to fix the problems, Rodriguez said. \n   \nReagan spokesman Matt Roberts said she has asked Spencer for a \u201cformal review and explanation.\u201d Spencer is not commenting about the dispute, Roberts said. \n   \nReagan also plans to meet with the leaders of the state Recorders Association next week, Roberts said. \n   \nThe Jan. 23 letter first obtained by the Arizona Center for Investigating Reporting is another sign that county elections officials are fed up with Reagan and her staff. \n   \nThey have previously complained about Spencer\u2019s failure to do a required update to the elections manual that all officials use to oversee elections and about other issues. \n   \n\u201cCommunication between the County Recorders and the Secretary of State\u2019s office is in a dire state, failing to function as an equal partnership or even a cooperative working relationship,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThere needs to be dialogue with State Election Director Eric Spencer, not dictation.\u201d \n   \nThe letter said Spencer has rated the performance of county recorders as \u201cincompetent,\u201d refused to answer critically important questions and been \u201ca most ineffective and disrespectful liaison from your office.\u201d \n   \n\u201cHis tactics include being rude and dismissive to the county recorders and their staff, rising to the level of verbal abuse, in both public and private meetings,\u201d it said. \n   \nThe state plans to replace its voter registration database, potentially issuing a contract before June. \n   \nThe letter also said it \u201cappears that the Secretary of State\u2019s office is advocating strongly for one statewide system for election management and actual voter registration processing.\u201d \n   \nThat worries Pima and Maricopa Counties, which have spent millions of dollars developing independent elections systems that could be rendered useless without proper planning. \n   \nSpencer\u2019s timeline would put the new systems in place in the middle of the 2018 election cycle. \n   \n\u201cThey\u2019re jamming this through,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cIt started in August, and what were we doing in August \u2014 doing the primary and general elections \u2014 that where our focus was at.\u201d \n   \nRoberts said the state is working with counties to get the right new system. \n   \n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: The statewide voter registration database is something they work in every single day,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for them that they have a system that works for them, and we\u2019re trying to bring together 15 counties who have differing views as to what that should look like.\u201d \n   \nGila County Recorder Sadie Jo Bingham complained that voter registration cancellations sent to her county did not contain required verification that the voters actually should be cancelled, Rodriguez said. \n   \nThe state routinely sends updates to counties with information it reviews from other states or counties about new registrations and asks them to cancel outdated voter lists. \n   \nIn one case, Bingham refused to cancel the registration of a voter she personally knew still lived in Gila County. She told the Center for Investigative Reporting that Spencer ordered her to cancel the registrations when she called to question them. \n   \nSpencer said in a response sent to Reagan Thursday that the office was acting based on a routine letter from another state inquiring about registrations. He said he never spoke with Bingham. \n   \n\u201cIn short, I categorically deny the character allegations that Sadie Jo has made against me,\u201d Spencer said in his email to Reagan, obtained by The Associated Press from her office. He did not address the letter from the recorders and its characterizations of his actions. \n   \nRodriguez said Reagan needs to change the tone coming from her office and rein in Spencer.

She is mistrustful of what she calls the mainstream media, particularly those elements she believes are biased towards the left.\n\nBut Smith has agreed to talk because she will, she says, use any platform to express her view that Islam is an ideology of violence, intolerance and sexism.\n\nSmith received relatively little attention during the last federal election as a NSW Senate candidate for the Australian Liberty Alliance, the political offshoot of the Q Society, which describes itself as \"Australia's leading Islam-critical movement\".\n\n(\"Q Society supports an integrated multi-ethnic Australia and rejects racism, which the Oxford dictionary defines as: 'Belief in the superiority of a particular race.' Since Islam is not a race or ethnicity, being critical of Islam is not racist,\" its website explains.)\n\nBut she is likely to receive far more press in the coming weeks as the co-defendant in a defamation action being brought by the businessman Mohammed El-Mouelhy, who was the subject of a critical video produced by the Q Society and presented by Smith.\n\nAlready Smith and the Q Society, also named in the suit, have rallied an impressive line-up of public supporters, including Coalition right-wingers Cory Bernardi, George Christensen and the former MP Ross Cameron, who are among a handful of public figures set to address fundraisers to be held in Sydney and Melbourne on February 9 and 10.\n\nWe sit and both reach for our phones to turn on recording apps. Smith has already explained that she wants her own record of our conversation. The tension dissipates \u2013 a little \u2013 when a sky-blue ute throbs past us and Smith laughs and points out the personalised number plate, \"TRUMP1\". Later she will tell me that she rejects the suggestion she is right wing, rather, she says she a part of the silent majority of mainstream conservatives whose voices are now being heard due to victories of Donald Trump and the Brexit campaign.\n\nSmith says she never intended to pursue politics. She has always been happiest as a wife and mother. \"I love being my husband's wife,\" she says to emphasise the point.\n\nAs it was, a confluence of events brought her to her mission. In 2000 Smith and her husband Greg, a tradesman, sought out volunteer work in Mali and there met the Assemblies of God missionary Faouzi Arzouni, whom she describes as a Muslim apostate who became a friend and mentor.\n\nTwo years later the couple went on another trip, a 10-day visit to refugee camps of the displaced of what is now known as the Maluku sectarian conflict in Indonesia, during which Christian and Muslim communities fell into violent political and ethnic conflict. Smith recalls sitting in refugee camps hearing terrible stories of violence perpetrated by Muslims.\n\nIn 2009 Smith's husband took her to a talk being given by the Q Society's Mark Durie, an Anglican vicar. During that lecture Durie said that his wife would not buy certain supermarket products because they had been certified as halal.\n\nSmith was intrigued and began her own investigations on the internet, learning that many brands are halal-certified, and that a portion of the fees paid for such certification is donated to Muslim charities. In other countries, Smith contends, those charities have directed funds towards groups with terrorist links. Her online investigation became a website, Halal Choices, a campaign and, with the support of Bernardi and Christensen, a parliamentary inquiry into \"third party\" food certification. Finally it became a political ambit, with Smith running for the ALA in a campaign launched by the anti-Islamic immigration Dutch MP Geert Wilders.\n\n\"There is no question of our country being Islamified. Now, this reply constituted a historical error as soon as it was uttered,\" Wilders once told Dutch parliament.\n\n\"I can report that they have had enough of burkas, headscarves, the ritual slaughter of animals, so\u2011called honour revenge, blaring minarets, female circumcision, hymen restoration operations, abuse of homosexuals, Turkish and Arabic on the buses and trains as well as on town hall leaflets, halal meat at grocery shops and department stores, Sharia exams, the Finance Minister's Sharia mortgages, and the enormous over-representation of Muslims in the area of crime, including Moroccan street terrorists,\" Wilders said.\n\nSmith says she does not believe there is an imminent threat of adopting Sharia law, but is concerned about what she calls \"creeping sharia\".\n\n\"We are being encouraged very strongly to tolerate sharia finance, halal certification, the hijab,\" she says.\n\n\"Sharia is definitely present in Australia \u2026 I believe there are honour killings and it is all reported under domestic violence or another name,\" she says. As evidence she says she has close friends who are pastors who work in churches who have provided sanctuary to victims.\n\nBut Smith's concerns are broader than creeping sharia. During the US election she was horrified by Hillary Clinton's support for abortion rights. She opposes political correctness, Safe Schools and big government regulations imposed upon farmers by distant bureaucrats.\n\n\"I pretty much oppose everything the Greens stand for,\" she says.\n\nShe was also appalled by the Liberal Party's abandonment of Tony Abbott for Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nThis broader political outlook, and Smith's articulate direct manner, has led some observers to speculate that she is a potential leader for a new conservative movement, one energised by the international populist surge.\n\nShe is, says John Adams, a former Coalition adviser who has written about the need for more intellectual depth in the new conservative movement, a more capable and charismatic messenger than, say, Pauline Hanson. (\"I think Pauline has a lot of good sentiment, I am not sure about the ability,\" says Smith of Hanson.)\n\nIn the months since the campaign Smith has kept in touch with supporters via videos on her Facebook page. In them she is relentlessly bright and articulate, upbeat about Christmas and Australia Day, though scandalised by the recent billboard that showed a pair of little girls celebrating in a hijab and cheerily opposed to the \"threat\" of multiculturalism. She denies ever having had media training, though confesses that she is constantly asked if she has.\n\nAsked if she plans to run for office again Smith says she cannot answer the question as her entire focus is directed towards the defamation action and her family.\n\n\"People say this is sexist, well I am sexist, I love being a wife and mother, that is the best I have ever done in my life\u2026 I love being my husband's wife.\"\n\nIn the next breath she adds that she and her husband have made the decision to use any platform to put forward their message.\n\n\"I want to be able to look my children in the eye and say I did everything I could to stand for what is right.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Islam-critical Kirralie Smith seen as potential libertarian leader","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2810","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Grenfell","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Grenfell Record","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"270688924","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Grenfell Record","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.grenfellrecord.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196065599","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:50:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/157221b2-f74a-469e-b91c-c9863ca767f7.jpg/r3_0_725_408_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

A lawsuit brought by states would heighten the legal stakes surrounding the president's executive order, signed late on Friday, as courtroom challenges to the ban have so far mostly been filed by individuals.\n\nOfficials in the offices of attorneys general in Pennsylvania, Washington and Hawaii said on Saturday they were evaluating what specific claims could be filed, and in which court.\n\n\"We do believe the executive order is unconstitutional,\" Hawaii attorney general Douglas Chin told Reuters on Saturday. He declined to give further detail.\n\nThe states could decide not to file, and it is unclear how many states would ultimately sign on for such an effort.\n\n\"There certainly are conversations underway,\" said Joe Grace, a spokesman for Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro.\n\nA Trump representative could not be reached immediately for comment.\n\nTrump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. He told reporters in the Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \"not a Muslim ban\" and said the measures were long overdue.\n\nHowever, his order hit a roadblock late on Saturday when a federal judge in New York said stranded travellers could stay in the country. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the emergency court order, said it would help 100 to 200 people with valid visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports after Trump signed the order.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it would comply with judicial orders but that Trump's immigration restrictions remained in effect.\n\n(Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco; Editing by Paul Tait) First Published","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US immigration news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. states discussing lawsuit over Trump immigration order","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Sharenet","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658161","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Sharenet","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sharenet.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196069189","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But that's not always so in London, Ontario, where hockey dreams are practically mixed into the water. \n\nThat is where Jeff Carter first saw Drew Doughty, his younger neighbor from around the corner, playing for Jim Carter's North London Nationals. \n\nThere was a swagger in Doughty's game that caught the boy's attention. It would not be the last time. \n\n\"Drew was just as good back then as he is now,\" Carter said earlier in January. \"Not much has changed.\" \n\nTwelve-year-old Jeff and 7-year-old Drew turned out to be quite the team. They won the Stanley Cup together in 2012, won a gold medal for Canada at the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014, and then won the Cup again later that year. Next, the pair will be All-Star game teammates when they lace up for the Pacific Division at Staples Center on Sunday. \n\nDoughty, the Kings' rock of a defenseman, will make his third straight All-Star appearance. Carter, who shouldered the Kings' offensive load for much of the first half, will do so for the second time in his 12-year career. But it will be the first time they play in the same All-Star game, adding to their shared resume. \n\n\"For us to spend another time like this together ... \" Doughty said before he paused, thought and started rattling off all he and Carter have accomplished. \n\nThis season, at least through 49 games, does not get tacked on to that list of highlights. \n\nThe Kings have battled bouts of inconsistency and would be a point out of the playoffs if they started next week. They have not won more than two straight contests since a five-game winning streak in late November. But Carter and Doughty - along with stopgap goaltender Peter Budaj and Tanner Pearson's 15 goals - have the Kings hanging around. \n\nCarter is tied for second in the league with 24 goals and leads the Kings with 43 points. He already has matched his goals total from last season, leads the NHL with eight game-winning scores and is on pace for the best statistical season of his career. \n\nDoughty leads Kings defensemen with eight goals and ranks second on the team with 20 assists. He also has worked seamlessly with different defensive partners throughout the season and helped the Kings allow the fifth fewest goals per game in the league. \n\nThen there is Carter and Doughty's immeasurable influence, which comes in different forms. \n\nTake a recent morning practice at Madison Square Garden, after the Kings opened a trip with a loss to the New York Islanders. Doughty barely closed his mouth, chirping at his teammates and letting out high-pitched shrieks whenever he picked up speed. \n\n\"Hey, nice save, Zatkoff!\" Doughty yelled through a gap-toothed grin to Kings' goaltender Jeff Zatkoff, who had just let the puck past him. \n\n\"Way to warm up the goalies, Seto!\" Doughty barked at forward Devin Setoguchi after he smacked a shot into Zatkoff's right pad. \n\n\"Come on, boys! Let's get one!\" he sung to no one in particular, his voice echoing through an otherwise sleeping arena. \n\nCarter, on the other hand, quietly flew through practice with his head down. He seemed to glide an inch or two above the ice while centering his line. He flicked shots past both of the team's goalies. Then he lightly tapped his stick against linemates to subtly say, \"Good job.\" \n\n\"They are very different interacting with the team,\" Pearson said. \"But that's why it's so great having both of them. Drew is Drew, loud and always talking. Jeff is Jeff, talking when he needs to but mostly leading by example. And we wouldn't be much without both of them.\" \n\nNow the Pacific All-Star team will see the precocious defenseman join the unshakable forward. Their long journey from Canada can be measured by both distance and daydreams. And on Sunday they will be right at home.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JESSE DOUGHERTYLos Angeles Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: field hockey news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Feel-good first for two Kings","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Centre","zipCode":"16823","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bellefonte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Centre Daily Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657424","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"756"},"name":"Centre Daily Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["IceHockey","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.centredaily.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196071327","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Both men, one of whom worked for the U.S. military during the Iraq War, have since filed a lawsuit against Trump. \n  \nto get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Nicholas Hautman"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: movie news","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: celebrity gossip","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Iranian Director Can't Attend Oscars Due to Trump's Muslim Ban 13 hours ago","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"US Weekly Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664901","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3462"},"name":"US Weekly Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Gossip","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.usmagazine.com"},"linkedArticles":[{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391454197"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391454201"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391454204"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391538775"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391538778"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391538781"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391538783"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391620862"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391620863"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391620866"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391620870"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391620873"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391620880"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391620881"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391695691"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391695694"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391781702"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391781703"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391781706"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391938530"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391938537"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392030345"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392102300"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392335477"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392335483"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392416441"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392499878"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392499879"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392578868"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392578870"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392669391"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392669398"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392743114"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392743117"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392743119"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392813842"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392813848"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392890903"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392890904"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392974476"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392974478"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392974483"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29393058864"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29393058867"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29393223819"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29393607533"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29393678888"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29393830527"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29394351648"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29394754395"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29395489417"}],"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/middleeast/iran-will-ban-us-citizens/","http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/2-iraqis-file-lawsuit-after-being-detained-in-ny-due-to-travel-ban/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695196071806","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Trump administration officials haven't confirmed the report. But both agencies have been frequent targets of budget hawks over the decades. Last year, the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, released a policy paper titled \"Blueprint for Balance: A Federal Budget for 2017\" that called for both agencies to be eliminated. \n \nThe paper's authors argue that neither agency is necessary because private donors support arts and humanities programs. \n \n\"Taxpayer assistance of the arts is neither necessary nor prudent,\" the authors wrote. \"Taxpayers should not be forced to pay for plays, paintings, pageants, and scholarly journals, regardless of the works' attraction or merit.\" \n \nSimilarly, in a policy paper released last year, the government watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste called the agencies \"examples of dabbling in fields that should be entirely free from government intervention.\" \n \n\"Actors, artists, and academics are no more deserving of subsidies than their counterparts in other fields; the federal government should refrain from funding all of them,\" the authors wrote. \"Anything else is anathema to taxpayers.\" \n \nSince 1998, the National Endowment for the Arts has awarded about $16 million in grants to Oklahoma agencies and institutions. The large majority of that funding \u2014 about $12.6 million \u2014 went to the Oklahoma Arts Council, which funds arts projects and programming. \n \nAmber Sharples, executive director of the Oklahoma Arts Council, said her agency uses those grants to support arts initiatives in communities across the state. For example, Red Earth, Inc., an Oklahoma City-based nonprofit, uses grant money from the state arts council to fund the Red Earth Festival, an annual celebration of American Indian arts and culture. \n \nThe state arts council makes a priority of supporting arts programs in rural parts of the state, where it may not exist otherwise, Sharples said. The agency has given grants to support community theaters in Hobart and Guymon, tribal powwows in Talihina and Tonkawa and music festivals in Skiatook and Grove. \n \nLikewise, the National Endowment for the Humanities gives grants to support research programs, historical preservation projects and other work. Since 1998, the agency has given about $14.1 million in grants to Oklahoma recipients, including about $8.7 million in state partnership grants awarded to the Oklahoma Humanities Council. \n \nThompson, director of the state humanities council, said much of the money her organization receives from the federal humanities agency funds programs targeted at low-income areas of the state. For example, the organization funds Let's Talk About It, Oklahoma, a reading and discussion program that takes place in cities and towns across the state. \n \nAside from supporting state arts and humanities agencies, both federal agencies also give grants to individual institutions. Last year, the University of Oklahoma's Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art received a $40,000 federal grant to produce \"Photo/Synthesis,\" an exhibition featuring photos by Navajo artist Will Wilson. \n \nFor the exhibition, Wilson photographed Oklahoma tribal community members, including several who were distant relatives of American Indians whose photographs were included in the 1930 portfolio \"Indians of Oklahoma\" by early 20th century photographer Edward Curtis. \n \nThat component of the exhibition \u2014 locating and contacting the descendants of the people included in the 1930 portfolio \u2014 would have been nearly impossible without federal grant funding, said Mark White, the museum's director. \n \n\"It never would have gotten off the ground,\" White said. \n \nMichael Baron, producing artistic director of the Lyric Theatre of Oklahoma, said funding from the National Endowment for the Arts has allowed the theater company to do productions it never could have managed otherwise. \n \nThe theater has received $286,000 in direct grants from the federal agency since 1998. It also receives funding from the state arts council, much of which comes indirectly from federal dollars. \n \nThose federal grants generally go to support productions and programs that aren't self-supporting, Baron said. In 2007, the theater used a $55,000 grant to stage the \"Oklahoma!\" production starring O'Hara in role of Laurey. \n \nIn 2015, the theater used a $10,000 grant to produce the debut of \"Bernice Bobs Her Hair,\" a musical based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Because the musical had never been produced anywhere before, it was risky to produce it at the Lyric, Baron said. Federal grants allow the theater to take those kinds of risks, he said. \n \n\"We're a nonprofit organization,\" Baron said. \"If we were a commercial venture, we would just do 'Mary Poppins' and 'A Christmas Carol.'\" \n \nBecause the agency spreads its grant funding around to institutions across the country, it ensures that high-quality theater can exist in places outside of New York and Chicago \u2014 places like Oklahoma City, Baron said. \n \n\"They're one of our biggest sponsors,\" Baron said. \"This is such a small government agency that is doing such great work.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Silas Allen"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Oklahoma arts leaders worry about fate of federal arts, humanities agencies","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Oklahoma","zipCode":"73114","state":"Oklahoma","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Oklahoma City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"NewsOK.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661781","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3441"},"name":"NewsOK.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsok.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196078334","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-27T22:03:02Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn2.newsok.biz/cache/w620-ef9740bcf9f45bc0697fb1edafefbfb6.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The Op 65 trio is less well known but deserving of attention. The passionate, big-boned style of its opening Allegro brings to mind the style of Dvorák\u2019s great friend, Brahms, though the Scherzo returns to more familiar, springy Dvorák terrain and the energetic finale could be by no other composer. This is virtuosic playing of a high order.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Fiona Maddocks"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Dvorák: Piano Trios Op 65 & 90 CD review \u2013 bursting with energy","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"The Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"353719887","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"The Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Music","Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com","publisher":"Guardian News and Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","http://observer.theguardian.com/","https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/29/dvorak-piano-trios-op-65-90-trio-wanderer-review#img-1","https://www.theguardian.com/profile/fiona-maddocks","http://twitter.com/FionaMaddocks","https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmusic%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fdvorak-piano-trios-op-65-90-trio-wanderer-review%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Dvor%C3%A1k%3A%20Piano%20Trios%20Op%2065%20%26%2090%20CD%20review%20%E2%80%93%20an%20exemplary&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmusic%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fdvorak-piano-trios-op-65-90-trio-wanderer-review%3FCMP%3","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Dvor%C3%A1k%3A%20Piano%20Trios%20Op%2065%20%26%2090%20CD%20review%20%E2%80%93%20an%20exemplary&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmusic%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fdvorak-piano-trios-op-65-90-trio-wanderer","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmusic%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fdvorak-piano-trios-op-65-90-trio-wanderer-review","https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmusic%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fdvorak-piano-trios-op-65-90-trio-wanderer-review%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_gp&hl=en-GB&wwc=1","http://www.triowanderer.fr/?lang=en","https://www.theguardian.com/music/antonin-dvorak","https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","http://syndication.theguardian.com/automation/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmusic%2F2017%2Fjan%2F29%2Fdvorak-piano-trios-op-65-90-trio-wanderer-review&type=article&internalpagecode=3122474","https://www.theguardian.com/discussion/p/5nh65","https://www.theguardian.com/most-read/music"],"sequenceId":"695196079596","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:17Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9501be59e6ed24fe7d05e7d810cb2835311d72f/0_209_4000_2400/4000.jpg"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9501be59e6ed24fe7d05e7d810cb2835311d72f/0_209_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=f1bc3bf91e6e5a12f6857706748dd6f2"}],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

The Australian Rugby Union has promised to \"strike a better balance\" on match scheduling at next year's Sydney Sevens after it emerged the Olympic champion women would play their quarter-final on a training field outside Allianz Stadium to make way for the men's group stages.\n\nThe ARU and World Rugby blamed \"contractual commitments\" for the embarrassing scenario, , with enough room to accommodate about 1000 spectators, across the road from the 45,000 capacity stadium.\n\nThe women will play all of their group matches on the main pitch during day one of the tournament on Friday, but Australia's golden girls, who were honoured with Order of Australia Medals last Thursday, will play their first knock-out game on Kippax Oval across the road while the men's tournament wades through their opening rounds.\n\nIt is a bad look for the ARU, which has leveraged heavily the women's success at the Rio Olympics to sell tickets to the first combined men's and women's Sydney Sevens. While sales to the women's-only Friday session have been slow, Saturday \u2013 the only combined day \u2013 has sold out and the all-men's Sunday has all but done the same.\n\nShould they make it through the quarters, the Australian women will play their semi-final at Allianz just after 2pm. The final and third and fifth-place matches will also be on the main arena.\n\n\"There are scheduling challenges associated with hosting two tournaments simultaneously, which will happen for the first time at this year's Sydney Sevens,\" an ARU spokesman said.\n\n\"While it was not possible to strike a better balance this year owing to player welfare and contractual commitments, we will be discussing with all parties to see how the schedule can be enhanced next year.\"\n\nWorld Rugby made a similar pledge, citing the same contractual obligations. World Rugby controls all sevens world series tournament scheduling, but it is not clear why the ARU did not make greater efforts to request moving some men's pool matches to Kippax instead to ensure maximum exposure for their high-profile and highly-successful women's team.\n\n\"The marquee women's matches, the cup semi-finals and final, will be played on Allianz Stadium on Saturday and every effort has been made to ensure that a world-class playing surface and match environment is provided on Kippax Oval for the 10 matches that will be staged there,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"The Australian women's sevens team will take centre stage when the tournament kicks off on Friday at Allianz Stadium.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Georgina Robinson"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"ARU promises 'better balance' at next year's Sydney Sevens after women's gaffe","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Narromine News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"351658586","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Narromine News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.narrominenewsonline.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196088437","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/4e468b87-100c-4a68-803a-38b3608f911e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2583","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Crookwell","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Crookwell Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"348364933","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Crookwell Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.crookwellgazette.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196090249","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Doug Ducey\u2019s repeated assertions that he is not the one fighting to keep \u201cdeferred action\u2019\u2019 recipients from getting licenses to drive are not true, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Mark Brnovich said Friday. \n   \nSince taking office two years ago, Ducey has refused to overturn a 2012 executive order by predecessor Jan Brewer denying licenses to those who are in this country illegally but allowed to remain and work under policies of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. \n   \nA federal appeals court already has enjoined as unconstitutional part of that order covering \u201cdreamers;\u2019\u2019 a separate lawsuit by other deferred action recipients still being denied licenses by Ducey\u2019s Department of Transportation is making its way through trial court in Phoenix. \n   \nDuring the last year Ducey has repeatedly sidestepped question from Capitol Media Services about his decision to leave Brewer\u2019s order in place. The governor said Brnovich\u2019s office is pursuing the issue and he wants to see what the courts ultimately rule. \n   \nRescinding the order aside, the governor also said it\u2019s not up to him to decide whether to settle this latest lawsuit. Instead, Ducey said those decisions are being made by Brnovich\u2019s office. \n   \nOn Friday, however, Brnovich spokeswoman Mia Garcia said that\u2019s not true. \n   \n\u201cThe governor\u2019s office and ADOT are being represented by outside counsel in this matter,\u2019\u2019 she said. \n   \nIt was Brewer who, on her own, hired Douglas Northup to defend he executive order, without going through the Attorney General\u2019s Office. And Northup continues to represent Ducey and his administration in court. \n   \n\u201cPlease refer to them for comment,\u2019\u2019 Garcia said. \n   \nGubernatorial press aide Daniel Scarpinato conceded Friday that Ducey\u2019s numerous prior statements about reasons for leaving the executive order in place and about Brnovich running the litigation were all in error. \n   \nHe said the governor\u2019s comments were not designed to mislead but instead perhaps due to the fact that Ducey inherited multiple lawsuits from the Brewer administration when he took office in January 2015. That includes one case since decided by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declaring that Arizona cannot legally deny licenses to those in President Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \n   \nBut the current case involving those in other deferred action programs -- another one Ducey said was being handled by Brnovich -- was filed in 2016, after Ducey had been governor for more than a year. And it specifically names Ducey as a defendant because he has the power to rescind Brewer\u2019s order. \n   \nThe disclosure about Ducey\u2019s role in the dispute and his refusal to overturn Brewer\u2019s order comes as a federal judge late last week rebuffed a bid by Northup to kill the current lawsuit filed by some \u201cdeferred action\u2019\u2019 recipients who are not DACA recipients but have been denied a license to drive. \n   \nJudge David Campbell said there is evidence that the five individuals who sued are being denied the same driving privileges that ADOT grants to others who have similar legal status. He said that gives them standing to bring their case to federal court. \n   \nThe judge also sniffed at claims by Northup that they actually can get a license -- if they produce certain other evidence. \n   \n\u201cDefendants do not identify any specific documents that plaintiffs may use for this purpose, nor point to any written policy of accepting those documents as sufficient proof of authorized presence,\u2019\u2019 Campbell wrote. \u201cIndeed, when asked during oral argument where a person could go to learn of this policy and how to comply with it, defense counsel was unaware of any place where it has been publicized.\u2019\u2019 \n   \nThe lawsuit has its roots in Obama\u2019s 2012 decision creating DACA which allows those who arrived in this country illegally as children to remain if they met other conditions. Those who qualify are issued Employment Authorization Documents permitting them to work legally in this country. \n   \nBrewer, in her executive order, directed ADOT not to provide licenses to DACA recipients, saying they are not qualified under a 1996 state saying these are available only to people whose presence is \u201cauthorized by federal law.\u2019\u2019 \n   \nBut federal appellate judges pointed out that Arizona has long issued licenses to those in other \u201cdeferred action\u2019\u2019 programs, requiring only their EAD as proof. Appellate Judge Harry Pregerson wrote that Brewer\u2019s order was motivated by \u201ca dogged animus\u2019\u2019 against dreamers. \n   \nIn the meantime, ADOT amended its policies to start denying licenses to other deferred action recipients, including those allowed to stay because they are victims of domestic violence or are cooperating with police on pending cases. Those in this category filed suit last year. \n   \nIn the new ruling, Campbell separately refused Northup\u2019s bid to dismiss the governor from the lawsuit. \n   \nHe said Northup would first have to prove that the decision by ADOT to expand the list of who is not entitled to licenses was simply a way of trying to kill the first lawsuit by DACA recipients by showing they were not being singled out. \n   \nBut Campbell said it\u2019s a whole different story if ADOT is denying licenses to these other deferred action recipients to comply with the 2012 executive order. That puts Ducey, who has left the order in place, directly in the role of denying the licenses to these deferred action recipients. \n   \nCampbell said there is evidence that the case revolves around that executive order that remains in force. \n   \nThe judge noted the executive order refers broadly to \u201cdeferred action recipients,\u2019\u2019 declaring that the deferred action program \u201cdoes not and cannot confer lawful or authorized status or presence upon the unlawful alien applications.\u2019\u2019 And it directs state agencies to \u201cinitiate operational, policy, rule and statutory changes necessary\u2019\u2019 to enforce that conclusion.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Ducey sidesteps license issue","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Mohave","zipCode":"86403","state":"Arizona","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lake Havasu City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Havasu News-Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169752151","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"172"},"name":"Havasu News-Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.havasunews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196095630","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2583","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Crookwell","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Crookwell Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"348364933","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Crookwell Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.crookwellgazette.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196099597","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

My brain stopped. My heart stopped. I was the living dead.\" \n\nThe boat is the sole source of income for Pideris and Marmarinos. Both vessels sat in the corrosive sea water for three days, until the roads cleared enough to bring in a crane. The electronics and engines on both vessels were destroyed. \n\nThe mayor of Lesbos says money from a humanitarian award, the Olof Palme prize, given to the islanders for embracing refugees will go toward the cost of repairs, estimated in the thousands. \n\nMarmarinos says he's proud \"because I offered help and I see it's coming back to me\u2026.even if no one helped I'd still be proud and if it happens again, I'd do the same,\" he says. \n\nMarmarinos and Pideris hope to be fishing again by early February.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: television news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"The Fishermen Braving the Freezing Mediterranean to Save Desperate Refugees","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"NBCNews.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"274867882","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"NBCNews.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts","Television"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nbcnews.com","publisher":"National Broadcasting Company"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/europes-border-crisis/migrants-shiver-icy-blast-grips-europe-s-crowded-refugee-camps-n705116","http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/europes-border-crisis/europe-migrant-crisis-one-young-syrian-s-journey-reunite-his-n673811"],"sequenceId":"695196107468","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2016_43/1769876/161027-migrant-lesbos-arrive-336p_39ab2259c28d7c5516deedbcf6fd6b20.jpg"},{"url":"http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_43/1769876/161027-migrant-lesbos-arrive-336p_39ab2259c28d7c5516deedbcf6fd6b20.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

She capped it with an 8-2 victory in the championship round over Cottonwood\u2019s Emma Coachman, the event runner-up. \n   \nAsia Jones of Cottonwood and Janie Posey of Houston Academy also finished in the top four at the event. \n   \n\u201cI feel great,\u201d Edenfield said. \u201cI have trained every day and every weekend I go out for hitting lessons, so I feel like this is basically something that shows off my hard work.\u201d \n   \nThe 38 homers surpassed her total of 34 from last year when she won the event at more homer friendly Northside Methodist. The total was shy of the annual event\u2019s overall record of 45 set by former Dothan standout Kasey Cooper, now a standout at Auburn. \n   \nEdenfield said this year\u2019s event felt easier to her since her swing wasn\u2019t as hard to produce homers following a year of physical growth. \n   \n\u201cHonestly it really does (feel different),\u201d said the 14-year-old Edenfield, who is listed as 6-foot-1 on Sneads High School\u2019s Maxpreps volleyball website. \u201cFor me, I have changed over the past year, so I felt easier and better (with a more natural swing). It was a lot better than last year.\u201d \n   \nEvent organizer Jason Ford, who coaches the Elite Lady Sox, said Edenfield had a dominating day, hitting several onto the nearby Northview baseball field over the left-field fence and that several of her shots were at least 250 yards in distance. \n   \n\u201cShe was just cutting it through the wind,\u201d Ford said. \u201cShe put on a show.\u201d \n   \nWith a slight wind blowing left to right field, hitting homers wasn\u2019t an easy task for the 10 hitters, all of whom were right-handed hitters. \n   \n\u201cYou had to hit it to get it out,\u201d Ford said. \n   \nThe eventual winner certainly didn\u2019t have such problems early. As the defending champion, she was the last of the 10 hitters in the early rounds. Each participant had to hit as many homers as possible before having 14 outs in each of the first two rounds. \n   \nAs Edenfield came up for her first round, Posey was leading the field with seven homers. \n   \nThat mark didn\u2019t last, though, as Edenfield blasted 21 homers before finally making her 14th out. That total equaled the combined total of the other nine hitters in the competition. It also broke the previous event record in one round of 20 hit previously by Cooper. \n   \n\u201cHonestly, I was surprised I hit 21 over in the first round,\u201d Edenfield said. \u201cI was absolutely surprised. I found my rhythm and just kept on hitting. Always starting off with a good start, especially in home run derbies, puts a lot more pressure on the competition.\u201d \n   \nShe hit just six in the second round, but her overall total of 27 easily advanced her to the semifinals. \n   \nJones finished as the second seed for the semifinals after hitting a combined 10 in the first two rounds. Coachman advanced as the third seed with eight homers and Posey moved on after finishing as the No. 4 seed with seven homers. \n   \nThe semifinals pitted Coachman as the No 3 seed against No. 2 seed Jones in a battle of Cottonwood teammates. With each semifinal participant getting just 12 outs, Coachman edged Jones 12-9 to advance to the finals. \n   \nIn the other semifinal, Posey went first, but struggled and hit only two in her 12 outs. Edenfield followed, needing only three to advance to the finals. Though she didn\u2019t need much to advance, she kept a simple hitting approach. \n   \n\u201cLet it go with the flow,\u201d Edenfield said. \u201cBecause if I put more pressure on myself then I know I won\u2019t do good. It is just one of those things to just let it go and do your job.\u201d \n   \nIt took a few swings, but she reached her third homer with two outs to spare. \n   \nIn the finals, the two participants had 10 outs to hit as many homers as possible. Coachman went first and hit two. Edenfield then belted eight out before recording her 10 outs to win the event. \n   \n\u201cJust do my thing,\u201d Edenfield said of her approach in the final round. \u201cSee the pitch, hit the pitch. Have my own selection (of what I wanted to hit).\u201d \n   \nThe repeat home run derby winner hopes she can build off Saturday\u2019s success for a strong season this spring playing for Sneads High School. \n   \n\u201cIt helps me mentally because it shows how much I can rely on my hitting,\u201d Edenfield said. \n   \nShe added, \u201cIt shows I can hit for power. That this is Michaela Edenfield.\u201d \n   \nDespite the less than ideal weather conditions, Ford said he was pleased with how things went at the event, a fund-raiser for the Elite Lady Sox. \n   \n\u201cThis is about the girls,\u201d Ford said. \u201cIt is a fund-raiser for us, but I love giving back to the girls in the community in having this event on a big stage. I appreciate the participants because it was cold out there, but they battled through it. These girls showed they didn\u2019t care about the weather. They love the game of softball and they came out here to compete.\u201d \n   \nHe was especially thankful for those that helped host the event. \n   \n\u201cI appreciate Northview and coach (Jessica) Noble for letting us host our event at their school,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI look forward to this event getting bigger in the future and having more girls participate.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"David Mundee dmundee@dothaneagle.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Edenfield repeats as Queen of the Diamond Home Run Derby champ","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Houston","zipCode":"36302","state":"Alabama","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dothan","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Army Flier","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170086534","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Army Flier","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.armyflier.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196109043","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:33:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dothaneagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/0c/40cb688a-e5ec-11e6-ada4-1f9c18bc1f40/588d8c98cf325.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200"}],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Suffolk","zipCode":"11796","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"West Sayville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sayville Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169674043","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Sayville Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sayville.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695196111642","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:53:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22877259/20170128/091105/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1485654598-9499.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The conservative former prime minister had seemed odds-on to win the presidency in elections to be held in three months' time, until satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine published a story this week that threw his campaign off track.\n\nThe report said his wife had received a salary from fake jobs, including several years as his parliamentary assistant. Fillon has denied the jobs were fake and said his wife had for years proof-read his speeches and prepared press reviews. In Sunday's paper, Fillon vowed to fight the accusations \"all the way\" but said he had never expected the presidential campaign to be so hard. \"I had no idea it would be so violent and drop that low,\" he said.\n\nAn official inquiry into the allegations has been opened. On Thursday, investigators searched the Left Bank headquarters of the prestigious Revue des Deux Mondes She was paid \u20ac100,000 ($141,000) for an 18-month stint at the journal, owned by a billionaire businessman friend of Fillon, according to the weekly, which said it had only found two articles signed under her pseudonym. Investigators have also seized Francois Fillon's file at France's official anti-corruption watchdog, which contains previous wealth declarations, the source added.\n\nWhat French media dubbed \"Penelopegate\" has rattled Fillon's supporters. It was not clear who could take up the baton if Fillon were forced to drop out of the race. On Friday, Fillon's former rival for the conservative ticket, Bordeaux mayor Alain Juppe, ruled out replacing him should he step down over the scandal.\n\nSeeking to retake the initiative, Fillon will hold a rally in Paris later on Sunday. In the interview, Fillon said he could bring France's unemployment rate, currently hovering around 10 per cent, below 7 per cent by the end of the next five-year term thanks to a mix of deregulation, lower taxes on wages and a higher retirement age.\n\nReuters","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Michel Rose"},"topics":[{"name":"France news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Presidential front-runner warns accusations play into far-right hands","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4000","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Brisbane Adelaide Street","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Brisbane Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658354","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"191"},"name":"Brisbane Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fworld%2Ffrench-presidential-frontrunner-warns-accusations-play-into-farright-hands-20170129-gu0s4u.html&title=%27I+had+no+idea+it+would+be+so+violent%27%3A+French+politic","https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fworld%2Ffrench-presidential-frontrunner-warns-accusations-play-into-farright-hands-20170129-gu0s4u.html&text=%27I+had+no+idea+it+would+be+so+violent%27%3A+French+politician+warns+agains","https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fworld%2Ffrench-presidential-frontrunner-warns-accusations-play-into-farright-hands-20170129-gu0s4u.html&title=%27I+had+no+idea+it+would+be+so+violent%27%3A+French+politician+warns+a","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fworld%2Ffrench-presidential-frontrunner-warns-accusations-play-into-farright-hands-20170129-gu0s4u.html&title=%27I+had+no+idea+it+would+be+so+violent%27%3A+French+p","http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fworld%2Ffrench-presidential-frontrunner-warns-accusations-play-into-farright-hands-20170129-gu0s4u.html&title=%27I+had+no+idea+it+would+be+so+violent%27%3A+French+politician+warns+ag","http://www.lejdd.fr/Politique/Francois-Fillon-au-JDD-Ces-manoeuvres-puent-la-calomnie-843284","http://www.lecanardenchaine.fr/","http://www.revuedesdeuxmondes.fr/","https://www.facebook.com/FairfaxForeign","https://twitter.com/FairfaxForeign","http://www.facebook.com/brisbanetimes","https://twitter.com/brisbanetimes"],"sequenceId":"695196124264","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T19:00:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/content/dam/images/g/u/0/x/q/0/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gu0s4u.png/1485673218096.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Isabel has been tagged as the kidnapper and killer of Jee based on statements of fellow accused SPO 4 Roy Villegas and Ramon Yalung. \n \nSta. Isabel, who served under Dumlao\u2019s unit, denied the allegation and claimed his superiors made him the fall guy. \n \nHe has asked the RTC to reinvestigate the criminal case against him. \n \nTags: Angeles City Regional Trial Court , arrest warrant , Camp Crame , Department of Justice , , Jee Ick-Joo , Manila Bulletin , restrictive custody , Supt.

(Photo: Courtesy photo) \n  \nThis weekend, coach Mark Dantonio and the Michigan State staff will host several top junior prospects on a recruiting visit. The Spartans already have two four-star commitments for the class of 2018 and could potentially add more in the near future. The players listed below are high on the recruiting board and could be offered in the near future. \n \nQB Theo Day of Divine Child High School in Dearborn \n \nDay is one the top pro-style quarterbacks in the Midwest for the class of 2018. The 6-foot-5, 190-pound is rated the No. 8 player in Michigan and the No. 14 quarterback in the nation by  Rivals.com . Day has already been offered by multiple Division 1 schools and Michigan State has been in frequent contact with him. \n \nDay camped at MSU this summer and was a top performer. This past fall, he excelled for Divine Child leading them deep into the playoffs. His visit to East Lansing could go a long way to him eventually receiving a Spartan scholarship. If he receives an offer, MSU could be tough to beat. \n \nDE Alex Reigelsperger of Wayne High School in Huber Heights, Ohio \n \nThe 6-foot-5. 230-pound Reigelsperger has an impressive list of scholarship offers and he could add another this weekend. Among others, Iowa, Wisconsin, Purdue, Pittsburgh, Kentucky and Rutgers have already extended him a scholarship.  Rivals.com  rates him a three-star recruit and one of the top players in Ohio for the class of 2018. \n \nReigelsperger has been a target of the Spartans for some time. He is very familiar with the Spartan program due to his former teammate Messiah deWeaver being a member of the Green and White. Led by defensive coordinator Harlon Barnett, the Spartans have recruited the Dayton area very well. If the Spartans extend Reigelsperger an offer this weekend, they will definitely be one of the teams to beat. \n \nLB Ed Warinner of Olentangy Liberty High School in Powell, Ohio \n \nWarinner is a 6-foot-1, 222-pound linebacker prospect that has some strong family ties to MSU. His father coached there in the 1980's and his mother is a Spartan graduate. He also has several family members that live in the state of Michigan. \n \nWarinner has over half a dozen scholarship offers and schools such a Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota and MSU are all actively recruiting him. His father was recently hired at Minnesota after coaching for several years at Ohio State.

In May, Pai opposed conditions imposed by the FCC on Charter Communication\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner Cable. \n \nLast week, then FCC chairman Tom Wheeler urged Republicans against dismantling the Obama administration\u2019s landmark \u201cnet neutrality\u201d protections that bar internet service providers from slowing consumer access to web content.

The freshly installed president vowed while campaigning that he would force Apple to bring production to US soil. \n \nYet, as other big companies have sought to appease the new administration with promises of jobs or investments in the United States, Apple has stayed low-profile. Major Apple contractor Foxconn this month confirmed that it is considering a $7 billion investment to make flat panels in the US in a joint project with Japan\u2019s SoftBank. \n \n\u201cI have discussed with my major clients about going to (the US) and they are also willing to invest, including Apple,\u201d Foxconn founder Terry Gou told reporters in Taipei. \n \nTaiwan-based Foxconn has given no details, and Apple declined to comment. \n \nGlobal Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry believed that moving manufacturing to the US, where many customers are, was more of a commonsense move than a political one. \n \n\u201cYou need to manufacture local products in local markets,\u201d Chowdhry reasoned. \n \nMaking things locally gives better control of distribution networks and lets manufacturers customise goods for local markets, the analyst noted. Whether politically motivated or not, Apple is not in the same position as automakers which relocated US factories overseas to cut costs, according to IHS manufacturing processes chief analyst Dan Panzica. Apple never moved jobs offshore, it created them there. \n \n\u201cThe Apple jobs were never here,\u201d Panzica said. \u201cThe entire supply chain grew in China.\u201d Apple benefits in Asia from a network that goes beyond subcontractors assembling smartphones, tablets or laptops. The California-based firm relies on a dense ecosystem of companies that make components and spare parts for its devices as well. \n \nChina also offers sources of important raw materials, along with cheap, flexible and abundant labor to keep iPhone assembly lines cranking along. It would be \u201cvery hard to replicate\u201d that situation with US workers without using \u201cmore robotics and less workforce,\u201d undermining the political aim of creating jobs here, according to Endpoint Technologies analyst Roger Kay. \n \nExacerbating the challenge, \u201cit makes no sense to make phones here if you have to ship all the components from China,\u201d said technology analyst Jack Gold of J.

However, green cards are not specifically mentioned in the executive order,\u201d the WSJ said. \n \nMicrosoft has also warned its shareholders that curbs on immigration could have a material impact on its business. \n \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also criticised Trump\u2019s decision to severely limit immigrants and refugees from certain Muslim-majority countries, saying America is a nation of immigrants and should be proud of it. \n \n\u201cLike many of you, I\u2019m concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page. \n \nPTI \n \nTags:  Donald Trump , Google , Google CEO , immigrants , Sundar Pichai , US President Donald Trump","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Google news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Google CEO Sundar Pichai criticises Trump\u2019s controversial immigration ...","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Tech2 firstpost.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"439589845","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"24"},"name":"Tech2 firstpost.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://tech.firstpost.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196152418","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It turns out however, that Trump has in fact decided to continue using his Android phone . \n \nThe exact model of Trump\u2019s phone is unknown, but it\u2019s speculated to be a Samsung Galaxy S3. If you\u2019re interested, the S3 has a 4.8-inch Amoled display with an HD resolution. The device up to 64GB of onboard memory, a 1.4GHz Exynos 4412 SoC and 1GB of RAM. \n \nThe phone was launched in 2012. \n \nTrump did intend to maintain his existing Twitter account after taking over @potus since taking over as the US President. It was assumed that he would use a secure device for that purpose. \n \nThe New York Times reports that this is not the case. \n \nReputed security analyst Bruce Schneier was surprised that the Oresident was still using the device. As he explains to Politico , Trump\u2019s Android phone is a \u201cconsumer\u201d device and easily vulnerable to hacks. The obvious hacks involving email accounts and Twitter passwords is a small risk, he says, compared to the risk of turning Trump\u2019s phone into a recording device with relatively simple hacks. \n \nSchneier explains that a motivated hacker, not just a state-sponsored one, can potentially commandeer Trump\u2019s phone, use it to record conversations, and take pictures remotely. \n \nThe White House and the Secret Service have apparently refused to comment on the matter. \n \nIf that\u2019s not bad enough, two of Trump\u2019s advisors have been reported (by Newsweek ) to be using private email servers for all their emails, including official ones. It was on the charge of using a private email server that Hillary Clinton was investigated by the FBI. \n \nTags:  Android , android phone , Android Security , CIA , Donald Trump , FBI , Secret Service , US President","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Mobile industry news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Handhelds news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Telecom news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Android news","group":"Technology"}],"title":"Donald Trump\u2019s unsecured Android phone can be turned into a spy cam: ...","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Tech2 firstpost.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"439589845","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"24"},"name":"Tech2 firstpost.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://tech.firstpost.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/president-trump-white-house.html?_r=0","https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/01/security_risks_13.html","http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-cybersecurity/2017/01/the-changing-face-of-cyber-espionage-218420","http://europe.newsweek.com/trump-emails-rnc-reince-priebus-white-house-server-548191?rm=eu"],"sequenceId":"695196153435","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Stunned, Mane turned to face his dejected teammates on the halfway line and muttered something under his breath. \n \nSubstitute Vincent Aboubakar then stepped up to blast underdog Cameroon into the last four of the tournament, setting off crazy celebrations from the players. Goalkeeper Ondoa leaped over the advertising boards and sprinted to the Cameroon fans, holding the Cameroon team badge on his shirt and punching his chest. He was pursued by teammates and even coach Hugo Broos, who ran across the field with his arms in the air, jumping in delight. \n \nThe game in Franceville finished 0-0 after extra time and Cameroon won 5-4 in the shootout, with Mane\u2019s the only miss. His kick seemed powerful enough, but Ondoa, diving to his right, stuck his left hand up in the air to stop the ball as it appeared to be going straight over him. \n \nSenegal, the team tipped to win this year after an ultra-impressive start, had itself to blame for its surprise elimination. \n \nSenegal\u2019s forwards missed chance after chance in normal and extra time, with Mane, Moussa Sow, Keita Balde and Henri Saivet all guilty of failing to convert good chances \u2014 either by missing the target, or finding Ondoa in the way. \n \nCameroon\u2019s progression to the last four was a turn up, even though the team was once a powerhouse of African soccer and the continent\u2019s first team to reach the World Cup quarterfinals. \n \nLately, Cameroon has been poor at major tournaments and this squad was missing some big-name players. How they might be ruing their unavailability after the youngsters who filled in for them have a chance at getting back into the African Cup final. \n \nCameroon is a four-time African champion but its last title was in 2002, ironically when it beat Senegal in a penalty shootout. \n \nEarlier, Burkina Faso was first into the semifinals after two late goals beat Tunisia 2-0. \n \nAristide Bance, with his dyed blond hair, came off the bench to hit a low shot into the bottom corner from a free kick in the 81st minute and break a deadlock at Stade de l\u2019Amitie. It was pretty much the big striker\u2019s first act of the game. \n \n\u201cI knew that Bance could get inside that defense and he has a great ability to shoot,\u201d Burkina Faso coach Paulo Duarte said. \u201cFortunately for us, the first shot was a success.\u201d \n \nPrejuce Nakoulma sprinted away on a counterattack four minutes after that, avoided a desperate tackle from Tunisia goalkeeper Aymen Mathlouthi way out near the middle of the field, and side-footed into an empty net to seal the game. \n \nBurkina Faso, which lost in the final two tournaments ago, will play Egypt or Morocco in the semifinals. Cameroon will face Ghana or Congo. The last two quarterfinals are on Sunday. \n \nBance\u2019s introduction in Libreville, greeted by wild cheers from the Burkina Faso fans, was a masterstroke from coach Duarte. Bance was a hero on Burkina Faso\u2019s surprise run to the final in 2013 but was benched at this tournament. \n \nThe buildup to the Ghana-Congo quarter has been dominated by the fitness of Ghana captain and striker Asamoah Gyan, who traveled to the northern town of Oyem on his own after diverting to Libreville to have a medical scan on a leg injury. Ghana says the injury is not as serious as first thought, opening the way for Gyan to lead the team against a dangerous Congo, with Ghana searching for a first title in 35 years. \n \nGhana was locked out of its first training session in Oyem after arriving late because of a delay with its luggage. But it eventually argued its way into the stadium. \n \nIn Port-Gentil, Morocco coach Herve Renard is looking to take a step closer to a third title with a third different team after winning in 2012 with Zambia and last time with Ivory Coast.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"AFRICA-NEWS"},"topics":[{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Cameroon news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Burkina Faso news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Ghana news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Senegal news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Senegal and Mane blow it, lose to Cameroon on penalties","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Africa-News.info","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"537604010","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Africa-News.info","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.africa-news.info/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196157227","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T22:13:15Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From a biological point of view, the answer is pretty simple: If we maintain the same diet and exercise habits we began in our twenties, most of us will inevitably put on some weight \u2014 and the process of losing weight becomes much more difficult in middle age. Why is this? Our body composition, dietary needs, and hormones all shift, beginning for some as early as the mid-thirties. In order to maintain a healthy weight, certain lifestyle habits must be developed to counteract those changes.

New job? New business? \n\nWhile 2016 was the year of the unexpected superlatives with Leicester City, Brexit and Trump, 2017 will be a year for businesses in Cornwall to drive growth and put all their woes behind them. \n\nAmanda Hubbard, from Asda Bodmin, with Bill Clarke, founder and chairman of Trewithen Dairy.\n\nTrewithen Dairy has recently signed a deal to supply Asda stores in the South West with its own branded milk. One of Cornwall and Devon's largest bottlers of milk, Lostwithiel-based Trewithen Dairy is now working with 11 of the chain's outlets in the region, having added six new stores to its roster. This year alone, Trewithen-branded milk sales have increased by 70%, notably in Asda's St Austell store, where about 3,000 units of milk are sold each week across the four milk lines.\n\nSam's diner in Fowey.\n\nIt's been a good year for the American-style Cornish eatery company Sam's. The small business is expanding with a fourth restaurant at the Cornucopia Food and Drink visitor attraction in St Austell, which is expected to open later in 2017.\n\nNo stranger to the county, with long-established and successful restaurants in Fowey, Polkerris, Truro and Carlyon Bay, this new site will again combine classic American dishes with the diversity and flavour that the Cornish larder has to offer. Emma Sixton, from Sam's, said: \"We're harking back to our original American influences but with a modern Sam's twist. We're really excited to be able to move forward with our plans for this site and enable more food lovers to be able to enjoy the unique Sam's style and great service.\n\n\"The façade will have a vintage 'Airstream' [caravan] aluminium-clad look that adds an extra bit of authenticity and the interior will be equally as quirky, which fits in well with our ethos of providing great food in a fun-filled and entertaining environment.\n\n\"We'll also be creating full and part-time jobs that will further add to the positive impact that the neighbouring Cornucopia development will bring when it opens next year.\"\n\nMalcolm Ball, the chief executive of WMC Retail Partners Plc, the organisation responsible for the site and the Cornucopia development, said: \"I'm really pleased that Sam's will be joining us at the St Austell Bay Retail and Leisure Park.\"\n\nSimon Lomax, managing director of Kensa.\n\nHeat-pump manufacturer and installer Kensa has found a strong footing in the residential market, making it one of the fastest-growing companies in the region. Kensa has enjoyed 23% growth with a £2.4 million turnover.\n\nAt first, Kensa's products were considered somewhat niche with an appeal to those embarking on Grand Designs-style projects but without mass market appeal. As renewable energy started to gain in popularity and profile, the market grew larger, but so too did the competition, with much larger, European operations entering into the UK marketplace.\n\nContinued uncertainty over government subsidies for the renewable heat sector has meant many of these larger rivals have focused their efforts on other markets or on other products, leaving Kensa as the current UK market leader. Managing director Simon Lomax said: \"As a relatively small business that is competing against better resourced rivals with global and pan-European distribution networks, we have emerged as market leader in terms of the volume of sales. We survive because we have designed a product that can be assembled using semi-skilled workers so that we can quickly recruit production staff, train them and have them fully productive within a short period.\"\n\nFurniture firm Julian Foye has enjoyed a good trading year.\n\nIt has been a good year for the furniture maker with the 2015/16 year up sales 5% on last year and 40% up in November alone on November 2015. The firm, which employs 40 staff, opened its latest showroom in Hayle five years ago at an investment of £1.5 million.\n\nIn September Julian Foye opened a new concession in its St Austell shop called The Lounge Company and has also just redeveloped its shop in Truro. A company spokesman said: \"In 2017 we are looking to develop our warehouse shop in St Blazey where we sell a good selection of British manufacturers' seconds as well as less expensive beds and bedroom furniture alongside second hand goods in good repair.\n\n\"We are also actively looking for a new site in Cornwall which must be at least 8,000 sq ft and have parking for our delivery vans and customers.\"\n\nProfessor Anne Carlisle, CEO of Falmouth University. Falmouth University is launching a £12.3 million programme to help budding Cornish tech entrepreneurs get their own start-up businesses off the ground.\n\nThe two-year programme funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and local partners is designed to help kick-start new companies in the Duchy and create high-value jobs, attract investment and boost the county's digital and technology industries.\n\nThe university said the Government had given the programme the go-ahead and committed funding for the project even after Britain leaves the EU. The first cohort of 20 students will be recruited to the Launchpad start-up incubation programme by May 2017 and will receive a £16,000 stipend to help launch their own tech businesses and to grow by targeting market demands and filling gaps in their industries.\n\nDoom Bar has made it in the Drinks List: Top 100 Brands.\n\nDoom Bar, produced at Sharp's in Rock, has been placed at number 70 in the inaugural Drinks List: Top 100 Brands, produced by licensed trade publication The Morning Advertiser. \n\nThe report, aimed at telling bar owners what tipples are selling well, said the beer's sales performance had \"catapulted the brand to dizzying heights\". Sharp's has seen the business grow by 25.1%t with a turnover of £37.9 million.\n\nThe number of permanent Sharp's Brewery employees has risen this year to 144 from 135 in 2015, the majority being production staff at the brewery.\n\nSharp's Brewery has been on the up with a multi-million investment at its Rock brewery.\n\nSisters Lerryn Ryall and Lucy Cox designed the Halto to fit to any halter neck bikini or swim costume, and provides effective cushioning.\n\nFounded in Cornwall in August 2015, Halto is the quirky invention of sister team Lucy Cox and Lerryn Ryall. \n\nHalto, which won the Start-up of the Year in the Western Morning News Business Awards, is a clever little cushion that holds the straps of a halter neck bikini to help prevent bruising, rubbing, blisters and neck aches. Lerryn said: \"Winning best startup has been the cherry on top of an already phenomenal year. We have loved launching Halto and have been overwhelmed by people's reaction to it. \n\n\"There is still so much more to come from us, so watch this space.\"\n\nThe Halto Crowdfunder pledge video pitch.\n\nThe Truro and Penwith College business team. Truro and Penwith College has had a good year so far with September 2016 seeing a 127% increase in the number of apprenticeshiplearners starting their course at the college.\n\nThe college has also launched a range of higher level managementapprenticeships, the first of which have been delivered inpartnership with Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. Others were also made availableto learners involved in the college's Rick Stein Academy, a partnership with the Rick Stein Group. \n\nA spokesman for the college said demand for bespoke training had continued to grow , with businesses keen to providepackages of training that enable employees to gain nationally-recognisedqualifications, cover regulatory obligations and contribute to business goals. \n\nSince April, nearly 300 adults looking to enhance their knowledgeand develop their careers have attended the college to find out more orprepare for higher level study through the college's higher level skills programme. Over one-third of these are now working towards a recognised higher level qualification.\n\nHe added: \"2017 is set to beanother positive year for Truro and Penwith College Business. In addition toexpanding the Spark and apprenticeship programmes, the Cornwall Skills Programmewill be launched at an employer information event on January 20.\n\n\"The programme will build on the increased demand for bespoke trainingpackages, helping businesses access European funding to cover all or part oftheir training costs.\"\n\nOver its 28-year history, Pendennis Shipyard has grown into a world leader in its field.\n\nPendennis is a specialist in superyachts, creating luxurious new-builds and restoring the finest motor and sailing super yachts in the world.Pendennis' investment in its facilities and people has certainly paid dividends, with the company turnover steadily increasing over the past three years, despite a global downturn in the super yacht sector.\n\nPendennis Plus, a division of the company, had £29.4% growth and £3.7 million turnover.\n\nDuring the past three years, the shipyard has undergone a £22 million modernisation plan, increasing the available undercover space to provide two 90-metre and one 45-metre construction halls, alongside the existing 150-metre dry dock. Pendennis also completed construction of a 7,564m sq non-tidal wet basin. \n\nThe Headforwards team has grown to 80 staff in five years. \n\nHeadforwards is an outsource software development company specialising in forming long-term relationships with their clients and creating dedicated teams of software developers for them.\n\nThe company recently merged with technical web agency UKNetWeb to create our new special projects division. A Headforwards spokesman said: \"This will enable us to work on smaller projects for our clients, such as prototypes, apps and e-commerce sites.\n\n\"Our number of clients has tripled this year prior to the merger and we won Best Cornish Business at the Hub Awards.\" Headforwards is aiming to reach 100 employees by May 2017 and 250 employees by May 2021.\n\nSpiral UK in Helston has had a great 2016 year and is looking to boost its order book further in 2017.\n\nSpiral UK has had a great year, having finished 2016 on a high with a bulging order books and seeing one of its staircases featured on Channel Four's Grand Designs.\n\nThe Helston company, which won the Manufacturer of the Year Award in the 2016 WMN Business Awards, received £1 million worth of new contracts in December alone, on the back of the TV programme. Spiral UK boss Eric Nicholls said the firm had received enhanced national awareness after winning the new contracts in December and being featured on the programme.\n\nHe said: \"From luxury staircases for multi-million pound apartments to highly specialist structures for offshore wind turbines to a major contract with the MoD, our recent orders recognised the enormous diversity we offer in staircase manufacturing. To have our work featured on Grand Designs concludes years of stairway specialism, highlighting our work in one of the country's finest architectural builds. We are simply delighted.\"\n\nExeter Chiefs player Jack Nowell, from Newlyn, opening St Austell Brewery's Small Batch Brewery, with head brewer Roger Ryman and chief executive James Staughton.\n\nSt Austell Brewery has had a number of successes this year, creating award-winning beer from its £350,000 small batch brewery, a £12 million growth in turnover and the acquisition of Bath Ales. \n\nThe brewery's estates director Adam Luck said continual investment in pubs and hotels across the South West, promotion of local talent and produce created a strong focal point for communities and visitors to the region.\n\nWatch beer critic Darren Norbury giving his view on what to look out for in a great beer before the Celtic Beer Festival 2016 at St Austell Brewery got underway:\n\nThe new small batch brewery has allowed for in-house research and development to create new beer styles for the growing craft ale market. The investment in brewing techniques and machinery is alongside an ongoing commitment to training and career development to nurture and retain talent.\n\nThe acquisition of Bath Ales this year will allow the brewery to expand premium offerings and to bring existing products to new audiences. \n\nRobert Camp, Stephens Scown's managing partner.\n\nThe Truro-headquartered law firm has had a terrific year and keeps winning awards after awards.\n\nStephen Scown was named the UK Law Firm of the Year at the British Legal Awards in November, beating big London firms like Mishcon de Reya and Shoosmiths. The first legal firm to introduce an employee-ownership scheme similar to the John Lewis scheme, it was also named Law Firm of the Year at the Symphony Legal Awards 2016 and the Modern Law Awards 2016, as well as picking up three legal sector awards for its marketing campaigns.\n\nIn February 2016 Stephens Scown came 12 th in the Sunday Times 100 Best Medium Sized Businesses to Work For.\n\nOne of Stephen Scown's on the completion of the acquisition, from administration, of the South Crofty tin mine in Cornwall.\n\nRobert Camp, Stephens Scown's managing partner, said: \"2016 has been a brilliant year for us. A personal highlight for me was the introduction of Scownership, our employee ownership scheme, which will give all of our staff an equal share in our profits. We are the first large law firm to bring this in, and it is the culmination of several years of hard work creating a scheme that would work for us and meet the stringent regulations that apply to law firms. \"We are immensely proud of our heritage in Devon and Cornwall, but often the legal profession looks to London and other big cities for a model of how business should be done. We are happy to be breaking that mould and showing that it is possible to have the talent and skill of a metropolitan law firm, with the benefit of being based in this wonderful part of the country.\"\n\nTeagle, based near Truro, manufactures and exports farming machinery.\n\nTeagle manufacture the market leading Tomahawk range of livestock feeder bedders, the most complete line-up available from any manufacturer in the world.\n\nTeagle Machinery was established in 1943 by William Thomas 'Tom' Teagle on the family farm near Truro.

Strongbow, the exploration company which in June completed the purchase of South Crofty Mine in Pool, has announced that trials to clean up contaminated water \u2013 vital to the scheme's success \u2013 have got under way.\n\nMeanwhile, the company confirmed it has made a formal application to Cornwall Council for approval that the planned use of the mine was lawful.\n\nIn the summer chief executive Richard Williams said: \"We continue to make good progress de-risking South Crofty and are hopeful we can get to the point where we are in a position to make a production decision.\n\n\"The next steps for us are the completion of the water treatment test work and related application to treat and discharge the mine water as well as publication of the preliminary economic assessment.\" After completion of the water treatment tests the company intends to apply for a permit to treat and discharge up to 25,000 cubic metres of mine water per day.\n\nSouth Crofty mine has full conditional planning permission to build new surface infrastructure and processing facilities. The company has now applied to Cornwall Council for a certificate of lawfulness of proposed use or development.\n\nSouth Crofty was Europe's last tin mine when it shut in 1998 despite vast deposits remaining underground. \n\nThe stunning Watergate Bay Hotel.\n\nSet on a two-mile stretch of sandy beach, Watergate Bay Hotel epitomises the contemporary British beach holiday.

They defeated a much-fancied Moroccan side and held pre-tournament favourites Ivory Coast to a 2-2 draw. \n \nIn Junior Kabananga they have a striker in red hot form. He has scored in all of the Dross games so far and will look to add to his tally against the Black Stars. \n \nThe Leopards have built a strong defensive unit and are a joy to watch going forward, as they showed in the game against the Ivory Coast. \n \nROAD TO THE QUARTERFINAL \n \nDR Congo qualified for the last eight of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations by topping Group C with two wins and a draw. \n \nDR Congo 1 (Junior Kabananga) Morocco 0 \n \nIvory Coast 2 (Wilfried Bony, Serey Die) DR Congo 2 (Neeskens Kebano, Junior Kabananga) \n \nDR Congo 3 (Junior Kabananga, Firmin Ndombe Mubele, Paul-Jose M\u2019Poku) Togo 1 (Kodjo Laba) \n \nGhana\u2019s Black Stars came second in Group D with six points from three games just behind Egypt who topped the group with seven points. \n \nGhana 1 (Andre Ayew) Uganda 0 \n \nGhana 1 (Asamoah Gyan) Mali 0 \n \nEgypt 1 (Abdallah Said) Ghana 0 \n \nTEAM NEWS \n \nGhana will be sweating on the fitness of skipper Asamoah Gyan, who limped out of the game against Egypt with a suspected groin injury. There has been no confirmation as to how long he will be out but he is a major doubt for the game against the DRC. \n \nMubarak Wakaso, Thomas Partey, Jordan Ayew and Frank Acheampong were rested for the tie against Egypt but will surely be recalled against the Leopards. \n \nFlorent Ibenge doesn\u2019t have any injury concerns as he has a full complement of players to call upon for the Black Stars test. \n \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \n \nJunior Kabananga (DR Congo) \n \nThe giant striker is the top scorer in the competition with three goals, scoring in each match during the group stages. \n \nKabananga [above wearing number 6 ] is a tall and physically imposing striker who is also a major threat aerially, as he showed with that bullet header against the Elephants of Ivory Coast. \n \nHead Coach Florent Ibenge will hope the Astana of Kazakhstan striker continues in his rich vein of form and helps propel DR Congo to a first semifinal since 1998 in Burkina Faso. \n \nChristian Atsu (Ghana) \n \nThe Newcastle United winger, alongside Thomas Partey, has been one of the stand-out performers in a Ghana side hoping to lift the title they haven\u2019t won since 1982. \n \nAtsu [below] is a pacy winger who is full of tricks playing from either the left or right flank like he does for the Black Stars. \n \n\n \nHe was immense in Ghana\u2019s first two group games against Uganda and Mali, taking on defenders and getting the crosses in for the likes of Asamoah Gyan and Andre Ayew to thrive on. \n \nWith Gyan a doubt for the game against DR Congo, Ghana coach Avram Grant will likely bring on Tetteh to complement the attack while relying on Atsu to supply the ammunition needed to edge out the Leopards. \n \nPROBABLE LINE-UPS \n \nDR Congo: Matambi; Issama, Ikoko, Tisserand, Mbemba; Maghoma, Kebano, Bope, Mubele;Kabananga, Mbokani. \n \nGhana: Razak; Partey, Afful, Acheampong, Boye, Amartey, Atsu, Wakaso, J.

It attracts nearly 200,000 people to its shores and surrounding campgrounds annually.\n\nWhile most come in the summertime to boat, hike and enjoy the sandy beach, use at the recreation area has been growing during the other three seasons, as well.\n\nWinthers said there is a good deal of interest by mountain bikers and horseback riders in developing trail systems to both the north and south of the lake.\n\nThe management plan will take that interest into account by expanding its reach beyond the immediate shoreline of the lake to include the area south to Lost Horse Creek and north to Tin Cup Creek.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of talk about the need for more parking at trailheads,\u201d Winthers said. \u201cPeople are also interested in making some of the roads more accessible for horse trailer traffic and the potential of a new horse camp. We also heard from people interested in mountain bike trails.\u201d\n\nThe plan now calls for compiling all the information officials gathered from the public meetings and other comments submitted to the national forest.\n\n\u201cWe do want to emphasize that we are still taking comment for a little bit longer,\u201d Winthers said. \u201cThe deadline is Feb. 28. We have been getting quite a few comments that way.\u201d\n\nComment forms are available on the Bitterroot Forest\u2019s website at www.fs.usda.gov/bitterroot \n\nOnce all that information is put together, Winthers said an overall plan will be developed over the next few months.\n\nWhen the plan is in place, Winthers said the forest officials will begin looking for potential projects. While some will require an environmental analysis, others could get started rather quickly.\n\n\u201cI think the earliest that we\u2019ll be able to get going on anything is next fall,\u201d Winthers said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Perry Backus"},"topics":[],"title":"Public offers input on future management of Lake Como","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Missoula","zipCode":"59801","state":"Montana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Missoula","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Missoulian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666796","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1972"},"name":"Missoulian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.missoulian.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.fs.usda.gov/bitterroot"],"sequenceId":"695196174716","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/missoulian.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/e1/0e1a5604-6305-5ec8-8141-5e2fd50af2ce/588bca685ab96.image.jpg?crop=1867%2C1050%2C0%2C29&amp;resize=1120%2C630&amp;order=crop%2Cresize"}],"video":[]}}

That\u2019s not to say if we didn\u2019t that we\u2019d just fully stop,\u201d Commissioner John Mathias said. \n \nEligibility and reimbursement vary by department, according to Union County Finance Director Jeffrey McClintock. For example, two employees in the Conservation District are paid in full by the county, he said, while others are reimbursed 100 percent. The average reimbursement in that department, which has eight employees, is 60 percent, he said. \n \nThe average reimbursement for eligible salaries of the Children and Youth department\u2019s 17 employees is 80 percent, McClintock said. Reimbursement for Children and Youth ranges from 50 percent to as high as 90 percent, he said. \n \nEligible salaries for Domestic Relations, which has nine employees, are reimbursed at 66 percent, McClintock said. The salary for District Attorney D. Peter Johnson is reimbursed at 65 percent. \n \nThe 911 center receives operations grant funding funneled through the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency. McClintock said it can cover employee salaries at 100 percent. However, if costs exceed grant funding, the runover is paid from county coffers, he said. \n \n\u201cFor 2016, I can tell you all the salaries, wages and benefits were covered at 100 percent,\u201d McClintock said. \u201cThey should all be covered in 2017 until they go to the joinder,\u201d he continued, referencing the planned consolidation of 911 services with Snyder County. \n \nThe victim-witness coordinator position, too, is covered by grant funding, McClintock said, with any potential cost overruns paid with victim service fees paid by criminal offenders. Grant funds totaled $60,329 over the previous two years, he said. \n \nThe salary for the county recycling director is reimbursed at 50 percent and the salary for Union County\u2019s detective in the district attorney\u2019s office is paid at the moment in full through a grant, McClintock said. Probation also sees reimbursement through supervisory fees, which totaled about $91,000 in 2016. \n \nThe county historical society is self-funded. McClintock said the society reimburses the county for two part-time positions. \n \nEmail comments to escicchitano@dailyitem.com .

Son Benjamin, 17, is hitching up a horse to take our daughter Susan to work. The temperature is staying right around the freezing mark this morning. All our snow has disappeared. The weather lately seems too warm for this time of the year. We are hoping for more cold weather next month which makes it easier to butcher beef and pork. When the temperature is cold, you can keep the meat cold while you work with it. \n \nOur week started out differently from usual. Susan and I were washing laundry in the basement when daughter Loretta, 16, heard something fall upstairs in the hallway. She called up to daughter Verena, 19, and didn\u2019t get an answer. Since it takes Loretta longer to climb the stairs, she yelled down to the basement for us to come help. \n \nVerena was breathing but could not open her eyes or talk to us. I called her doctor and they said to take her to the ER. Lots of tests were done, but she would not respond. The doctors decided to transfer her to a bigger hospital an hour away. She was admitted there and a CT scan, MRI, and lots more testing was done. She started opening her eyes and finally said a few words to me. Tuesday evening she was released and we brought her home. The doctors think it was due to some recent head trauma that caused her to black out like that. \n \nShe has a history of lots of small concussions since a bad one in 2009 in which she lost over a year of her memory. She has been through a lot. She seems weaker than usual since she\u2019s home and has headaches. She would be interested to hear from others that have dealt with post-concussive syndrome after a brain concussion. She has had her share of hospital visits due to past concussions. The brain is hard to figure out and doctors still have lots to study about how differently one brain heals from another. \n \nIt\u2019s a scary moment for the family when you can\u2019t get someone to respond and not sure what will happen. That is when we especially depend on God! He is in control. Let us trust him for he makes no mistakes. \n \nToday we will go help daughter Elizabeth with her cleaning preparing for church services at their house. Her husband Timothy\u2019s family went to help them on Tuesday. Church services will be there a week from Sunday. This is a new experience for them to host church services. Jacob and Emma will host services two weeks after Timothy\u2019s so we also want to help Emma with her cleaning. It doesn\u2019t look like there will be much time to rest this winter. Our friend Beth is going to take us to Elizabeth\u2019s with her van. I didn\u2019t want Verena to ride in the buggy yet. Verena will go along but can rest over there. She can help keep Baby Abigail entertained while we clean. \n \nTime is going fast and I need to be ready to go by 8:30 a.m. God\u2019s blessings to all. Prayers would be greatly appreciated and we will do likewise in great weakness. Stay healthy. \n \nTry this breakfast casserole. We like something like this even for supper. \n \nCHEESY HASH BROWN BREAKFAST CASSEROLE \n \n8 frozen hash brown patties \n \n6 eggs \n \n2 cups milk \n \n1 cup sour cream \n \n1 teaspoon garlic powder \n \n1 teaspoon ground mustard \n \n1/4 teaspoon black pepper \n \n6 slices bacon, crisply cooked and crumbled \n \n8 ounces shredded cheddar cheese, divided \n \n2 green onions, thinly sliced \n \nPlace hash brown patties in a single layer in a 9 by 13 baking dish sprayed with non-stick cooking spray. Bake in 450 degree oven for 20 minutes or until browned, turning patties after 10 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees. \n \nBeat eggs in a large bowl with a wire whisk. Add milk, sour cream, garlic powder, mustard and pepper; mix well. Stir in bacon, 6 ounces of the cheese and onions. Pour over hash brown patties. Sprinkle with remaining cheese (add more cheese if desired). \n \nBake 40-50 minutes or until center is set and edges are golden brown. \n \nContact Eicher at LovinasAmishKitchen@MennoMedia.org .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Lovina Eicher Lovina's Amish Kitchen"},"topics":[],"title":"Scary moments for Eichers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Northumberland","zipCode":"17801","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Sunbury","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Item","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169679596","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1031"},"name":"Daily Item","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailyitem.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196177612","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She could be cuffed by Sunbury\u2019s finest. \n \nThe ordinance is specific to ladies.  \n \nOnce again in 121-7, the ordinance states that any solicitation of drinks is illegal and any owner or bartender that allows this behavior to take place is also in violation of the ordinance. \n \n\u201cWhat?\u201d stunned Sunbury police chief Tim Miller asked when presented with the question on whether he would command officers to make arrests based on the ordinances. \n \n\u201cNot a chance.\u201d \n \nIt almost seems like city officials and former mayor, the Rev. Donald Morgan, may have received advice from two of the most famous fictional television landlords of all time: Stanley Roper and Ralph Furley. \n \n\u201cMr. Roper,\u201d played by Norman Fell, and \u201cMr. Furley,\u201d played by Don Knotts, were landlords on the hit ABC television show from the 1970s, \u201cThree\u2019s Company.\u201d \n \nBoth landlords always tried to catch \u201cJack Tripper,\u201d played by John Ritter, in a lie about his living arrangement with his two female companions. \n \nAccording to section B of 121-7, if a landlord or hotel manager even suspects the unlawful registration of an unmarried couple and rents to the couple anyway, he, as well, is at fault and in violation of the law. \n \n\u201cWe need to get these updated,\u201d Miller said. \u201cMany of the ordinances are extremely dated and an overhaul is in order. We can actually just get rid of a lot of these.\u201d \n \nAccording to a spokesperson at the Pennsylvania Municipal League in Harrisburg, each municipality is responsible to update their ordinances as they see fit. Having old ordinances isn\u2019t uncommon, the spokesperson said. \n \nThe Pennsylvania Municipal League is a non-profit, nonpartisan organization established in 1900 as an advocate for Pennsylvania\u2019s Third Class cities. \n \nIf you do happen to get arrested for any of these older ordinances and need to seek advice of a criminal defense attorney, several may come running to your rescue. \n \n\u201cI would say some of these are unconstitutional and I believe we would win,\u201d Sunbury attorney Joel Wiest said. \u201cThankfully I never had to defend anything like this.\u201d \n \nLuzerne County criminal defense attorney Edward Olexa said he would take the case of a female looking for drinks and argue the justification for the law violates the equal protection guaranteed by the United States Constitution. \n \n\u201cCurrent constitutional law prevents a state or locality from singling out individuals in laws or ordinances based on gender unless they have an exceedingly persuasive reason for doing so,\u201d Olexa said. \n \n\u201cIn these cases it is unlikely that the city of Sunbury would be able to cite such a reason for prohibiting the conduct by women and not prohibiting it by men.\u201d \n \nNorthumberland County Chief Public Defender Ed Greco was stunned when hearing the ordinances. \n \n\u201cAfter I stopped laughing I can tell you it is completely unconstitutional and unenforceable,\u201d Greco said. \u201cSo if anyone would be arrested please call me. I\u2019m in the phonebook.\u201d  \n \nCity Councilwoman Beth Kremer said because some of the ordinances are so old they just sit there on the books. \n \n\u201cThere are some pretty screwy ones out there,\u201d Kremer said. \u201cIt would be time consuming but I would be willing to sit down and find a way to just get rid of these.\u201d \n \nAnother Sunbury code seeks to outlaw the sale of guns and fireworks in city limits. \n \nAccording to ordinance 121-4, no person in the city shall have in their possession with the intent to give away, sell or offer for sale any pistol, revolver or any other types of gun. \n \n\u201cObviously, this is another one that needs to be changed,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI can assure you that some of these older ordinances that are on the books will not be enforced and we really need to get updated.\u201d \n \nFines for these older ordinances range from $25 to $300 \n \n\u201cWe know they (laws) are there and on the books but to take those out it costs thousands of dollars,\u201d Sunbury Mayor David Persing said. \u201cOnce they would be taken out they need to be voted on and then it needs to go back to state codification to be rewritten and there is a large fee but believe me we know these are still out there and on the books.\u201d \n \nEmail comments to fscarcella@dailyitem.com .

Proceeds from the sale of paintings by local artists are also donated to the cause.  \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re all small businesses so we can\u2019t do big things, but we can do this,\u201d said Kathy Snyder. \n \nOver the past eight years, Brushstrokes has raised more than $8,700 for Valley organizations. This year, they are accepting donations for the Danville SPCA, Mostly Mutts, Haven to Home, the Far Point Collie Rescue, the Lycoming Animal Protection Society, Arthur\u2019s Pet Pantry, and the Far Point Animal Rescue.  \n \n\u201cI call them [the beneficiaries] ahead of time and ask them what they need,\u201d Mrs. Snyder said. \n \nShe added they post the donation needs on the store\u2019s windows for people to learn what to donate. In the past, she recalls blankets, crates, dry cat food, and even homemade dog beds being donated to the drive.  \n \n\u201cPeople come back every year and I really appreciate that,\u201d she added. \u201cIt shows me there are far more caring people than you hear about.\u201d  \n \nAbby Erdley, of Arthur\u2019s Pet Pantry in Lewisburg, said, \u201cThe more people help, the more animals we can help.\u201d She said the fundraiser is \u201ca huge, huge help\u201d for her organization, which gives pet food to financially distressed owners. \n \nThe Pet Pantry has benefited from Brushstrokes\u2019 fundraiser for the past two years and each time, Erdley said, her Jeep is filled with dog and cat food by the time the fundraiser ends. \n \n\u201cA lot of my clients are elderly,\u201d Erdley said. \u201cNo one wants to see them give up their pets because they can\u2019t feed them. Because of their help, we feed 200 pets per month. I can\u2019t speak highly enough of her [Kathy Snyder].\u201d  \n \nCheryl Hill, the owner of the Mostly Mutts shelter near Sunbury, said her organization also gets a boost from the \u201cWarm Your Heart\u201d drive. \u201cThe fundraiser brings in items we would not usually get,\u201d she said. Hill added the shelter receives dog beds, different types of dog food, and other items they cannot usually afford.  \n \n\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize there are so many dogs and cats in need in this area,\u201d she continued.  \n \nKathy Snyder said the store does the drive annually because she and her husband have always loved animals.  \n \n\u201cI was the little kid who would have a little cat and dog under each arm,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey\u2019re just good company, whether it is a good or a bad day.\u201d  \n \nBrushstrokes is open Monday though Thursday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Friday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The store will also have special hours during the \u201cWarm Your Heart\u201d fundraiser on Sunday from noon to 4 p.m. \n \nTo see the original art for sale, visit the Brushstrokes\u2019 Facebook page at  facebook.com/Brushstrokes-Gallery-Art-Supplies-and-Framing-192528178349 .

Having flown in the area many times in the past, sometimes alone, I had only a vague awareness of its scary reputation at that time. \n \nYears ago, I received a gift of a book titled, \u201cThe Bermuda Triangle,\u201d by Charles Berlitz. I was surprised to read how planes and ships, some within sight of land, totally disappeared. Then I found other source materials which also made the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle more fascinating. \n \nI learned from my research that the U.S. Coast Guard, which officially does not believe in the Bermuda Triangle, nevertheless identifies its location to those requesting information about it in their form letter File No. 5720, from the 7th Coast Guard District. It states the following: \n \n\u201cThe Bermuda or Devil\u2019s Triangle is an imaginary area located off the southeastern Atlantic coast of the U.S. which is noted for a high incidence of unexplained losses of ships, small boats and aircraft. The apexes of the triangle are generally accepted to be Bermuda, Miami, Florida, and San Juan Puerto Rico.\u201d The attitude of the Coast Guard, which states that \u201cofficially\u201d the Bermuda Triangle doesn\u2019t exist, however, \u201cthis is its location,\u201d certainly adds to the mystery. \n \nDisappearance of ships began to be recorded after the Civil War. But it was a few months after World War II that a startling incident occurred, suggesting that planes flying over the area could vanish from the sky for perhaps the same reason that ships had been vanishing from the sea. Six U.S. Navy planes and their crews disappeared in the Triangle on Dec. 5, 1945. It was the key incident that aroused attention and interest in the area that gave the Bermuda Triangle its name. \n \nSome readers may recall seeing a simulated presentation on TV, or read about the unusual disappearance of the six Navy planes. The first five planes that disappeared were on a routine training mission. They had been ordered to follow a triangular flight pattern, starting at the Naval Air Station at Fort Lauderdale, Fla., then 160 miles to the east over the Atlantic, 40 miles to the north and back to the air base, following a southwest course. After the disappearance of the five planes, a giant rescue plane, a Martin Mariner with a crew of 13, vanished in the same area during the rescue attempt. The five missing planes were Navy Grumman Avenger Torpedo Bombers, manned by five officer pilots and nine enlisted crew members. One enlisted crewman had a premonition about the flight and begged off going. Each aircraft carried plenty of fuel to cruise at least a thousand miles. Pilots who had flown earlier that day reported ideal flying weather. \n \nFlight time was estimated at two hours for this mission. Lt. Charles Taylor with more than 2,500 hours flying time, who was in command, led the planes to Chicken Shoals, north of the Island of Bimini, where the first part of their mission was to make practice runs on a target hulk. Pilots and crew were experienced airmen, and there was no reason to expect anything of an unusual nature to happen during the routine mission. \n \nBut something unusual did happen. The tower operator at the Naval Air Station received an unusual radio message from Lt. Taylor. The tower record has the following: \u201cFlight leader calling tower. This is an emergency! We seem to be off course. We cannot see land. Repeat. We cannot see land!\u201d Tower: \u201cWhat is your position?\u201d Flight leader: \u201cWe are not sure of our position. We seem to be lost.\u201d Tower: \u201cAssume a heading due west.\u201d Flight leader: \u201cWe don\u2019t know which way is west. Everything is wrong. A strange white haze. Even the ocean doesn\u2019t look as it should.\u201d \n \nThen it became increasingly difficult to hear messages from the tower to the flight because of static. However, tower personnel could hear portions of transmissions between the lost planes, telling each other that their aircraft\u2019s magnetic and gyro compasses were crazy and showing erratic and different readings. \n \nFinally, the tower heard the flight leader say to the others, \u201cWe must have passed over Florida and are out over the Gulf of Mexico.\u201d The flight leader then apparently decided to turn in the wrong direction in the hope of flying back to Florida. But as they did so, their radio transmissions began to get fainter, indicating that they had made a wrong turn and were flying away from Florida. The final transmissions heard were: \u201cEntering white water \u2014 we are completely lost.\u201d \n \nJoseph A. Diblin, of Northumberland, was a four-engine pilot during World War II and has worked as a test pilot and civilian flight instructor. He is also seaplane rated.

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2650","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Wagga Wagga","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wagga Wagga Daily Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169711399","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"54"},"name":"Wagga Wagga Daily Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailyadvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196186343","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

passed an executive order   which halts immigration from seven Islamic nations including Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and Syria, for at least 90 days. For Syrian refugees, the ban is indefinite. Trump said that the order was to keep away radical Islamic terrorists. \n \nThis has caused a lot of furore not just among the general population, but also among technology companies. \n \nMost of the top technology firms in the US are filled with staff who aren\u2019t native US citizens. And logically enough, most leaders from across the technology industry spectrum have criticised this new temporary ban that Trump has issued. \n \nMicrosoft Corp, Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Uber Technologies and many other companies have expressed concern about the immigration order\u2019s effects on their employees, according to the Wall Street Journal .  \n \nHere is what the heads of top US tech companies have to say about this order. \n \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella, himself an immigrant told the Wall Street Journal that he had experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has had on Microsoft as well as for the US and the world. He said that Microsoft Corp would continue being an advocate on the issue. \n \nApple CEO Tim Cook has sent an email to his employees assuring them that Apple has contacted the White House to explain the negative effects of such restrictions. Cook had also spoken about the importance of immigration, both to Apple and the US\u2019s future, when he had visited Washington last week. \n \nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said that the order affected close to 187 current Googlers. \u201cWe\u2019re upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US. It is painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,\u201d he said. \n \nFacebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg put out a status on his Facebook page stating that both his and his wife\u2019s parents were immigrants to the US. \u201cWe need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don\u2019t pose a threat will live in fear of deportation,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \n \nDigital storage firm Box\u2019s CEO Aaron Levie said that the move was quite infuriating and morally wrong. He said that he was looking at ways to get personally involved and fight the order. \n \nAmazon\u2019s vice president for HR, Beth Galetti, said that a diverse workforce helps Amazon make better products for its customers. It has sent out an email to its staffers, recommending US based employees from countries in the ban-list, from travelling outside the US. It has also asked such employees to get in touch with the company if they are already outside the borders for travel or work. \n \nTags:  Alphabet , Amazon , Apple , Box , Donald Trump , Google , Microsoft , Satya Nadella , Sundar Pichai , Tim Cook , Trump","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Silicon Valley news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Apple news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US immigration news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Silicon Valley isn\u2019t happy: Here\u2019s what top tech CEOs have to say about US President Trump\u2019s immigration order","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Tech2 firstpost.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"439589845","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"24"},"name":"Tech2 firstpost.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://tech.firstpost.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-leaders-target-donald-trumps-travel-restrictions-1485649332","https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103460278231481?pnref=story"],"sequenceId":"695196189861","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2650","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Wagga Wagga","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wagga Wagga Daily Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169711399","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"54"},"name":"Wagga Wagga Daily Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailyadvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196190029","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n \n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n \n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n \nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n \n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n \n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\" \n \n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Ingham","zipCode":"48842","state":"Michigan","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Holt","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"92.9 WLMI","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"195058734","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"92.9 WLMI","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.929wlmi.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196194652","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Syrian refugees have exceptionally been barred from the US \u201cindefinitely.\u201d \n \nIn a less-than-tacit rebuttal of Trump\u2019s policy, Trudeau wrote on his Twitter page on Saturday, \u201cTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada.\u201d \n \nOrder... and then chaos \n \nThe Canadian premier also posted a picture of himself greeting a Syrian child at Toronto\u2019s airport in late 2015. \n \nTrump\u2019s ban, which American media say has not been thought through and been drawn up without an understanding of the legal and other difficulties it will raise, has bewildered US officials. Homeland Security and State Department career officials, who say they have not been briefed about the specifications of the order, have had to enforce haphazard practices at airports in the absence of clear instructions. \n \nTravelers from the listed countries have been stopped from boarding US-bound planes since the order was issued on Friday. People who were already mid-flight were detained on arrival in the US even if they held valid visas or other approved applications. \n \nCanada has received more than 39,000 refugees from Syria alone and has promised to allow 300,000 more refugees, mostly coming in for economic reasons, from other countries in 2017. \n US President Donald Trump takes the cap off a pen to sign an executive order to start building a wall on the Mexico border to stop refugees, in Washington, DC, January 25, 2017.

But in so doing, the US president was unwittingly demonstrating his incognizance of the facts even as he attempted to sound informed of history. The 9/11 attacks were carried out by 19 terrorists, 15 of whom were from Saudi Arabia; the rest were from Egypt, Lebanon, and the United Arab Emirates. Nationals from none of those countries have been subjected to the \u201cvetting\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order has meant to enforce.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Canada news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Canada\u2019s Trudeau takes a jab at Trump 5min","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IR","country":"Iran"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"PressTV.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552639271","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1225"},"name":"PressTV.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://presstv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196199430","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He has also referred to the nuclear agreement as \"the worst deal ever negotiated.\" \n \nIran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the United States, France, Britain, Russia and China -- plus Germany started implementing the JCPOA on January 16, 2016. \n \nHollande also warned Trump against taking a protectionist approach, which he noted may have a negative economic and political outcome. \"In an unstable and uncertain world, turning inward would be a dead-end,\" he said. \n \nHe also reaffirmed France\u2019s commitment to the UN and the NATO military alliance, both of which Trump has voiced skepticism over. \n \nThe French president also stressed that anti-Russia sanctions should only be removed after the conflict in Ukraine is ended. \n \nThe United States, the European Union and some other Western countries have imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia over accusations that Moscow has been involved in the crisis in Ukraine, which has killed nearly 10,000 people to date. The Kremlin strongly rejects the allegations. \n US President Donald Trump speaks during a joint press conference with Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May (not seen) in the East Room of the White House on January 27, 2017 in Washington, DC.

Analysis, quotes, recap and box score. \n SPIRIT'S TAKE  \nSaturday had all the makings of a season-saver. \n \n\nThen it wasn\u2019t. \n \nOle Miss had No. 5 Baylor on the ropes early. The Rebels led by as much as 15, and even when  Baylor came roaring back in the second half, Ole Miss responded. Breein Tyree, in his coming-out party, made a late 3 to put the Rebels ahead 72-70. But Ole Miss, ultimately, let down by its veterans. Cullen Neal had two turnovers in the last minute-plus. Deandre Burnett managed four points on 1 of 10 shooting. Tyree was terrific, scoring 18 of his team-high-tying 20 points in the second half. He was 6 of 9 from the field and 2 of 3 from 3. He didn\u2019t miss a single one of his six free throw attempts.  \n \nIn the end, though, a feel-good story, what could have been a turning point for a moribund Rebel group, turned into just another loss \u2014 a result the Rebels have become far too familiar with. \n \nOle Miss played inspired basketball in the first half. But it was more than that. The Rebels played outside themselves.  \n \nThey entered play first in the SEC in turnovers committed. They had one in the period, and they made shots. They were 46 percent from the floor and 5 of 10 from 3. Ole Miss is what it is, however, and it defaulted to what\u2019s lead it here, out of the NCAA Tournament discussion and searching for something, anything, to inject life into a season that, barring a stunning turn, will hinge on whether the Rebels make a run in the SEC Tournament in March. They turned the ball over late, finishing with seven total. They lost the rebounding battle \u2026 again. They were minus-10, even surrendering an unthinkable 13 offensive rebounds. Foul trouble led them out of the 1-3-1 defense that gave Baylor such trouble (Bear guard Manu Lecomte said Baylor hadn\u2019t faced the defense all season) and into more traditional man-to-man and zone looks.  \n \nOle Miss played well, and the Rebels should certainly be commended, especially considering the disappointment of their four-point loss to Texas A&M. Still, moral victories mean little or nothing in basketball, and they mean even less, if possible, when a team\u2019s postseason resume is void of signature wins and the opportunities to get a few quickly drying up. Ole Miss needed, desperately, to beat Baylor. It didn\u2019t. So here the Rebels are, back in the same position they\u2019ve been in time and again in 2016-17 \u2014 fighting to keep their heads about water and failing, soon to drown. \n QUOTABLE  \nOle Miss head coach Andy Kennedy \n \nOn the loss: \u201cWe have one turnover at the half. Turnovers have been problematic for us. As Breein Tyree has evolved into a primary ball-handler, I think it\u2019s solved some of our issues. We had four big ones down the stretch. Bree, what a great game he played against a really good team and a really good player (Lecomte). He\u2019s going against an all-league caliber point guard and an older kid and I thought he did a great job for us keeping us in it, keeping us in it. (Terence Davis) gets in foul trouble and really never developed a rhythm in the game. Dre continues to struggle. But Bree kept us around. He had the one turnover down the stretch, and we caught a ball out of bounds. Some awareness stuff. We\u2019re late on a couple of three-point shooters. Give Baylor credit; I thought they were really out of sorts. Their best player gets in foul trouble early. They go to their bench and get production out of guys who had not produced to that level throughout the course of the year. They stay in the game, stay in the game. The 1-3-1 bothered them early. It didn\u2019t bother them late, which forced us to go man-to-man, which puts us in foul trouble. When (Sebastian Saiz) picks up his fourth with about nine play, we really had to try to sellout to that 2-3 zone. I thought it bothered them on fourth shot, but this is the second game in a row, at home, that we get destroyed on the glass. You\u2019re not going to beat quality teams. You\u2019re not going to beat the No. 2 team in the country. All credit to Baylor. I\u2019m proud of my guys\u2019 effort. I thought they played really hard. If they play this hard for the rest of the season, we\u2019ll win some more games.\u201d \n \nOn the struggles to rebound: \u201cI think part of the rebounding problem is guys not willing to get uncomfortable and truly committing to the fight. That\u2019s what I really think. I look at our stat sheet and I\u2019m playing 22, 23-year-old guys 25, 28, 29 minutes. They\u2019ve got as many rebounds as a dead man. That tells me they\u2019re not engaged in the fight. We\u2019ve got to get in the fight, man. If you don\u2019t get in the fight, you\u2019re not going to win SEC basketball games.\u201d On Breein Tyree: \u201cI think, physically, he\u2019s in a good place. He hasn\u2019t had any setbacks as it relates to the injury. Now we\u2019re just going through the freshman growth \u2014 up down, up, down. But really proud of him tonight because he stepped up and made plays. I played for two Hall of Fame head coaches, and that\u2019s one thing they told me every single day. They\u2019d say, \u2018Kennedy, players make plays.\u2019 They\u2019re right. Baylor made them. Our guys tried. Came up a little bit short.\u201d On Rasheed Brooks, who returned to the court for the first time since his seizure: \u201cI thought, emotionally, he was locked in. It was hard for me to play him. We keep +/-, and he was, like, -14 when he was on the court. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t have him in at the end. His timing, he hasn\u2019t played to the speed of the game in some time. He wanted to play, I wanted to play him. He\u2019ll get better as he gets more in rhythm.\u201d On liking his team in the preseason, how he feels about them now: \u201cMy wife says I always like them in September and October. Get back to me in February. We\u2019re about in February. I\u2019ve gotten a little spoiled in that we\u2019ve gone the senior-oriented, fifth-year (transfer) deal a couple of times and it\u2019s really worked. Nobody was an all-league player, but it was pretty seamless. I considered Dre that because he\u2019s been around college basketball; he\u2019s five years removed from high school, and he was in our program last year. His role has obviously changed from being a practice player to being a game guy, and a guy I thought would get all-league votes last year. It hasn\u2019t been as seamless as I would have hoped. We\u2019ve got to keep working with it, and we\u2019ve got to keep figuring it out. We\u2019ve got to find a way to win another game. \n RECAP  \nOXFORD, Miss. (AP) \u2014 Manu Lecomte scored 17 points, Johnathan Motley and Jo Lual-Acuil Jr. each added 16 and No. 5 Baylor rallied to beat Mississippi 78-75 on Saturday in the SEC-Big 12 Challenge. \n \nBaylor (20-1) rallied from a 15-point deficit in the first half to win its fifth straight game. The Bears trailed 50-40 early in the second half, but pushed ahead to take their first lead at 56-54 with 10:25 left after Motley made a pair of free throws. \n \nIt was a close game from that point forward. Lecomte hit a decisive 3-pointer with 23 seconds left that made it 78-72 and sent many of the Ole Miss fans to the exits. \n \nThe 5-foot-11 Lecomte shot 6 of 9 from the field, including 5 of 6 from 3-point range. \n \nOle Miss (12-9) dominated early on and jumped out to a 33-18 lead with 6:33 remaining in the first half. Sebastian Saiz and freshman Breein Tyree both scored 20 points for the Rebels. That was a career high for Tyree. \n \nBIG PICTURE \n \nBaylor: The Bears struggled, especially when Motley was in foul trouble during the first half, but surged ahead late to escape Oxford with the win. Now they've got another tough road game at Kansas on Wednesday. \n \nOle Miss: It's a missed opportunity for the Rebels, who put a scare into Baylor but still leave with the loss. Ole Miss has now lost six of their last nine games. \n \nUP NEXT \n \nBaylor travels to face No. 2 Kansas on Wednesday. \n \nOle Miss stays at home, where it will face Mississippi State on Tuesday. \n \nBOX SCORE","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Rebs Can't Pull Upset of Baylor","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Ole Miss Spirit","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169744478","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Ole Miss Spirit","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","Basketball"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mississippi.scout.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196211930","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The event charged $5 for a wristband that allowed attendees to go to the various booths and a coin that allowed people to vote for their favorite dish. \n \n\"The turnout's been fabulous,\" said Ashlee Champagne with the United Way for South Louisiana. \"We have new sponsors this year, but it's great that the public has really come out today.\" \n \nOver 100 people were milling about the Marriott parking lot, trying out the various samples from the 24 teams that were vying to be this year's supreme soup chef. Along with different soups, drinks and baked goods were for sale, charity raffles were being held, and the band, Pot 2 LA, played an eclectic mix of energetic and fun music. \n \nAt only one hour into the event, some of the competitors had completely run out of samples. Ampol Services had made 10 gallons of its smoked brisket chili and still ran out so fast that the cooks said they didn't even get a chance to eat any of it. \n \n\"We only got to try it when we were cooking it,\" said Barry Champagne. \n \nSome interesting twists on the definition of soup were handed out at the event, too. Along with red bean gumbo and apple pie soup, the soup that won the \"Fan Favorite\" award was Synergy Bank's \"souptini.\" It was a loaded baked potato soup served in a disposable martini glass with a Parmesan crusted pig in a blanket on a toothpick instead of the traditional olive. The team also provided free tropical virgin martinis in an area of tables it set up next to its booth. \n \n\"The marketing department came up with it,\" said Missy Hutchinson with Synergy Bank. \"They're really creative.\" \n \nChristine Martin, who attended with her granddaughter, Brelynn, said she had been coming to the event since the very first SOUPer Bowl and said the crowd was \"fantastic.\" \n \n\"It's at least tripled in size since the first one and it's fabulous,\" Martin said. \"You feel like you're at a fair with all these people.\" \n \nA first for the event was the 5K run that started before the SOUPer Bowl at 9:30 a.m. The race had 50 runners participating and the trophies, which depicted little running chefs in honor of the cook-off, were provided by Grand Isle Shipyard Inc. The winner of the race was Matt Kelso, who said it was more than just a race. \n \n\"It's a great little event for a great cause. It's not about winning a race, it's about helping the community,\" Kelso said. \n \nAs the event began winding down, the coins were counted and the winners were announced. \n \nIn third place was Sonoco with its smoked turkey and green onion sausage gumbo. In second place was Terrebonne General Medical Center with its seafood bisque. And in first place was GSES/Workforce Logistics with its crawfish and smoked corn soup. The team, named Team \"No-Tell,\" was made up of head chef Joey Rogers, Randy Steib, Maria Chaisson and Eddie Doiron. \n \n\"This is our first year participating and only our second year here and it feels great,\" said Steib after his team won. \"We made soup great again.\" \n \nAll proceeds for the event went to the United Way for South Louisiana.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"SOUPer Bowl warms up patrons on a chilly day","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Terrebonne","zipCode":"70360","state":"Louisiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Houma","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Houma Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169670432","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"453"},"name":"Houma Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.houmatoday.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196213562","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Mehta received his Ph.D. in anthropology with a focus in archaeology from Tulane and has been studying the millennia-old mounds along the Gulf for many years. He said he believes the ancient monuments are at risk. \n \n\u201cLouisiana\u2019s coastal heritage is incredibly threatened from coastal erosion, sea-level rise and human interference,\u201d Mehta said. \u201cIt\u2019s all at risk.\u201d \n \nMehta is studying the mounds along the Louisiana coast with Tulane doctoral candidate Elizabeth Chamberlain and says the mounds are a rarity when considered next to other similar ancient monuments. \n \n\u201cWe have no evidence of the people of coastal Louisiana engaging in any kind of agriculture,\u201d Mehta said. \u201cMore broadly across the world, monument building is tightly tied to agriculture. Only in a few locations like here and coastal Peru do you see monuments without agriculture.\u201d \n \nMehta said these mounds are culturally and historically significant, pointing to the fact that the mound at Poverty Point in north Louisiana is a Unesco World Heritage Site alongside the Great Pyramids of Giza and the Taj Mahal as proof of their importance. \n \nAnd studying these mounds and the movement of the ancient tribes, he has gotten some insight into why the people of Louisiana would abandon one settlement and move to another. \n \n\u201cThere are older settlements to the west and younger settlements to the east,\u201d Mehta said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really understand the mechanism of abandonment and resettlement, but, broadly speaking, the settlements seemed to align with the age of the Delta.\u201d \n \nAccording to Mehta, from 400-1400 A.D., the outflow of the Mississippi River was Bayou Lafourche and it was around this time that the mounds in the region were built. One of the more impressive mounds that Mehta mentioned was the one at Bayou Grand Caillou that is about 26.25 feet high. \n \nThere are also mounds in the Dulac area. Although one that was located near Bayou Hardware has been destroyed, two still exist off Shrimpers Row. \n \n\u201cI think it\u2019s really amazing and beautiful from the top of it,\u201d said Candace Chauvin, a member of the United Houma Nation whose family lives next door to the mound. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising that so many people don\u2019t even know about their history. It\u2019s so important.\u201d \n \nChauvin, who was in attendance for Mehta\u2019s recent presentation on the subject at the Grand Caillou Library, said she wishes more could be done to save them. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019re just disappearing. I really wish there was some way to preserve them,\u201d Chauvin said. \u201cI\u2019m so glad Dr. Mehta did his presentation at the library. People need to know about this stuff.\u201d \n \nMehta is also a humanities teacher at the New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts and a principal at the Gulf Communities Research Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to \u201cpreserving the health, resilience, and lifeways of coastal peoples.\u201d \n \nAccording to Mehta, the current land loss projections are threatening to wash away the mounds outside of levee rings. \n \nHe also says even though places like Dulac and Bayou Grand Caillou are \u201cprotected for some time,\u201d if we don\u2019t fight land loss and reintroduce sedimentation and subsistence, it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely possible we will lose these sites.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe have to do more. We know that historically the Mississippi River would create around half-a-football field of land an hour, yet we\u2019re losing an entire football field an hour now,\u201d Mehta said, quoting recent land loss studies. \u201cIt\u2019s scary that natural systems aren\u2019t able to keep up anymore. We need to do more.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Native American mounds threatened by land loss","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Terrebonne","zipCode":"70360","state":"Louisiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Houma","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Houma Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169670432","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"453"},"name":"Houma Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.houmatoday.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196213852","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"64108","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kansas City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kansas City Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667893","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1100"},"name":"Kansas City Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kmbc.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196217317","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://hips.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/traveler-released-at-jfk-airport-1485651543.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

We just discovered (what Trump did) at the airport when we went to check in. I want people to know that this is not just happening to refugees. I am a graduate and I have a PhD. It has happened to a person who is working and who pays tax.'' \n \nMs Tayari grew up in Italy and she and her boyfriend are trying to find another way to get home to Glasgow. \n \nOne option is to fly to Madrid however this would cost £2000 and they would still then have to travel onwards to Scotland. \n \nShe said: ``We had been saving for months for this holiday and it will cost me a month's salary just to get home,'' she said. \n \n``I am destroyed. I did not know that I could cry for so long. It feels like the beginning of the end. How this is possible? I am really afraid about what is going on.'' \n \nMr Trump's order barred all refugees from entering the US for four months, and indefinitely halted any from Syria. He said the ban was needed to keep out ''radical Islamic terrorists''. \n \nThe president's order immediately suspended a programme that last year resettled in the US about 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice. \n \nScottish politicians have taken to Twitter to express their views on the issue. \n \nScottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson tweeted: ``Back from Copeland to read the news of the US ban on migrants from Muslim countries. Both wrong in itself and very worrying for the future.'' \n \nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ``Scotland & US have deep friendship built on values. We must all speak up for those values - tolerance, equality & refuge for those in need.'' \n \nShe later wrote: ``#WelcometoScotland too'' after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted: ``To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada''","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Costa Rica news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Central America news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Scotland news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Vet stranded in Costa Rica after Trump's immigration crackdown","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Dunbartonshire","zipCode":"G81","state":"Scotland","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"West Dunbartonshire","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Clyde 2","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"173213965","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Clyde 2","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.clyde2.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196228059","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I really hope you find her soon.'\"  \n \nOn Dec. 16, Rosie was on a doggy playdate when a gate was accidentally left open, Moreno said. When no one was looking Rosie began to wander off.  \n \n\"By 10 o'clock that first night there were almost 30 cars in the area searching for Rosie,\" Moreno said. \"And many of those people were strangers.\"  \n \nAs time went on more and more people became attached to Rosie and her story.  \n \n\"Rosie is a unique dog,\" Moreno said. \"She can go from being super playful, to a lap dog instantly. When she plays it is nonstop, her favorite toys are basketballs and soccer balls. She is really gentle too \u2014 she loves little kids.\"  \n \nDuring the search the family also got help from Missing Dogs Massachusetts, who had heard about Rosie.  \n \nClothes were put out for Rosie to track the scent home, her favorite toys (basketballs and soccer balls were spread across town) cameras and traps were set up, and during this entire time people continued to post on the Facebook page saying they were praying for the return of Rosie, had been out looking for her or just asking for the most recent update.  \n \n\"I don't know if it was our love as a family for her or me and the family constantly posting, that made people so dedicated to finding her,\" Moreno said. \"I think because we were so adamant about finding her it made someone else adamant and someone else.\"  \n \nBecause of the constant search for Rosie the search teams found two other lost dogs along the way, which people had originally called in thinking they were Rosie \u2014 who is all black except for some white on her nose and chest.  \n \n\"I remember seeing a picture of Rosie that someone had taken one day and then she ran off,\" Moreno said. \"She looked so scared it melted my heart. I was so happy just to know she was alive but I bawled knowing how scared she must be.\"  \n \nOver the weeks, sightings of Rosie were reported and the Morenos learned about their dog's adventure including a cat friend Rosie had made and played with, her jumping around in the snow after the first storm, playing hide and seek with an employee at the landfill and wandering around town. \n \nAnd on Jan. 9, the search ended.  \n \nThe Morenos had gotten a call about two possible sightings. Jose Moreno, Kelly's husband, drove to Dean estates, one of the sighting locations, saw animal tracks and followed them only to discover a deer, not Rosie.  \n \nHe drove around the area when he saw something black.  \n \n\"He said, 'Hi pretty girl' in a sweet voice like he always does and when the dog turns around it is Rosie,\" Kelly Moreno said. \"He dropped to his knees and said it again, in an even sweeter voice.\"  \n \n\"She started walking over closer to him until she is about 15 feet away and all of sudden starts wagging her tail and whimpering realizing it is Jose.\"   \n \nMoreno said Rosie ran to Jose, jumping on him and licking him before happily getting into the car and finally after 24 days out wandering in Taunton was going home.  \n \n\"We all were so happy to see her and now that she is back it is like she never left. She lost about five pounds but besides that is in good health,\" Moreno said. \"The funny part is geographically she was very close, just across the river from us. It was like she was trying to get home but she just couldn't cross the river.\"  \n \nBut that wasn't the end of the community's involvement in Rosie's or the Morenos' lives.  \n \nRight after Rosie was found, Moreno put pictures of Rosie and the family smiling from ear to ear on the #findrosie page, and dozens of pictures followed over the next few days \u2014 but they were not of Rosie.  \n \n\"People began taking pictures of their own pets and posting them on the page saying \"Welcome home Rosie,\" Moreno said. \"It was really, really touching.\"  \n \nOn the page are pictures of cats and dogs, of all breeds and sizes, with messages welcoming home Rosie.  \n \n\"Since then people have been leaving toys and even dog beds on our porch too,\" Moreno said. \"The overwhelming amount of support we have received from the community during this is incredible.\"  \n \nMoreno said some people have been so captivated by Rosie's story that they have asked to meet her.  \n \n\"We want to host a meet and greet with Rosie for everyone to meet who helped bring her home,\" Moreno said. \"We want to have a day in the spring.\"  \n \nSince Rosie has been found Moreno has been using the #findrosie page to pay it forward and let it be an area where she and other people can pass the word along about other lost dogs or post pictures of dogs found without an owner, in hopes of reuniting families.  \n \n\"I am so incredibly grateful to everyone, whether they just kept a lookout for Rosie, called for a possible sighting or just passed the word along \u2014 all of that helped find Rosie,\" Moreno said. \"We all found her together.\"  ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sara ClineTaunton Gazette"},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer: pets news","group":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"A Rosie ending to a lost dog tale","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bristol","zipCode":"02740","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"New Bedford","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Dartmouth & Westport Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"357606559","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"355"},"name":"Dartmouth & Westport Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://southcoasttoday.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196236767","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It was the fourth annual Sunshine Millions Cal Cup, and for the most part it was a chalky day. The first seven winners were post-time favorites. \n \nAnn Arbor Eddie, owned by two-time Derby winner J. Paul Reddam and trained by Doug O\u2019Neill, returned $7.20 as the 5-2 third choice, scoring his third victory in four starts under jockey Mario Gutierrez to improve his lifetime earnings to $238,700. He ran the 1 1/16 miles in 1:44.65. \n \nAshleyluvssugar, trained by Peter Eurton and ridden by Flavien Prat, went postward as the even-money favorite on the strength of four Grade II victories on his resume. He won for the ninth time in 20 races, raising his bankroll to $1,145,004. \n \nFor Ann Arbor Eddie, he\u2019s now won two of the races California Chrome won early in his career \u2014 the King Glorious Stakes and the Cal Cup Derby. He\u2019s no Chrome, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not eligible to go on and have a fine career. \n \n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t done anything wrong,\u201d said O\u2019Neill\u2019s assistant, Leandro Mora. O\u2019Neill was in Florida to saddle Semper Fortis in the Pegasus World Cup. \n \n\u201cHe\u2019s given us three wins and a third, so we\u2019re very, very pleased.\u201d \n \nGutierrez said he was concerned at the three-eighths pole when Ann Arbor Eddie, a Square Eddie gelding, didn\u2019t seem interested in finishing. \n \n\u201cI started asking him a little bit. He didn\u2019t want to pick up the bit,\u201d he said. \u201cI was worried a little bit turning for home because I really had to ask him. He has so much more ability than that. He\u2019s still a little green.\u201d \n \nMora said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Reddam shoots for bigger things next time. \n \n\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if we go against the big guys,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done well so far, so why not keep following that philosophy?\u201d \n \nAshleyluvssugar, who received a rail-skimming ride until the stretch, when Prat swung the 6-year-old gelded son of Game Plan to the outside of pacesetting What a View, came in off a fifth-place finish in the Grade I Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf at Santa Anita and a second-place showing in the Grade II Hollywood Turf Cup at Del Mar. \n \n \nPrat said he encountered no problems during his 1 1/8-mile journey on the grass that resulted in a final clocking of 1:46.43. \n \n\u201cI had a good trip,\u201d he said. \u201cIt came really easy. Once he gets the lead, he doesn\u2019t want to open up, but he knows he has to keep at least a head in front.\u201d \n \nSaid Eurton: \u201cThat was a nice, easy lead that What a View got. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get by him for a minute there, but Ashley\u2019s got a lot of class.\u201d \n \nEurton said the $200,000 Grade II San Luis Rey Stakes at Santa Anita on March 25 might be the next stop for Ashleyluvssugar. \n \nIn the three other Sunshine Millions Cal Cup races: \n \n\u2022 Sircat Sally transferred her terrific dirt form to the grass in the $200,000 California Cup Oaks for 3-year-old fillies, following a 12-length victory in the Soviet Problem Stakes at Los Alamitos on Dec. 17 with a 2 1/4-length win as the 4-5 favorite with Tyler Baze aboard. Winning time was 1:35.08 for the one mile on turf. \n \n\u2022 Richard\u2019s Boy, the 2-1 favorite, took the lead at the top of the stretch and then held on to beat Well Measured by a nose under Prat in the $150,000 California Cup Sprint. The 5-year-old gelded son of Idiot Proof ran the six furlongs in 1:08.71. \n \n\u2022 Enola Gray won for the fifth time in eight starts, running away to win the $150,000 Sunshine Millions Filly and Mare Turf Sprint by 3 1/4 lengths as the 3-5 choice with Baze aboard. The 4-year-old daughter of Grazen\u2019s winning time for the 6 1/2 furlongs down the hillside turf course was 1:12.1","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Ann Arbor Eddie, Ashleyluvssugar are big winners at Santa Anita","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"90503","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Torrance","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Breeze","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169676533","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"296"},"name":"Daily Breeze","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailybreeze.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196247697","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kazmir went 10-6 with a 4.56 ERA in 26 starts and made only one start after Aug. 22 because of what was described as thoracic inflammation. Kazmir said it turned out his neck and shoulder problems were the result of a chain reaction that began with compensating for inflexible hips with faulty mechanics. \n\nAfter pinpointing the problem in the offseason and being treated weekly with acupuncture, cupping and yoga, Kazmir said he's ready to take back his job. \n\n\"I'm three weeks ahead of schedule. I want to be at the top of that rotation,\" said Kazmir, who led the American League in starts and strikeouts in 2007. \"The way things went last year, I have a chip on my shoulder and I want to prove to the fans and the front office that brought me here that they made the right decision.\" \n\nAt Saturday's Dodger Stadium FanFest, president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said Ryu has relayed news that he's healthy after shoulder and elbow operations the past two years. \n\n\"The reports have been really good,\" Friedman said. \"Came into offseason in a little bit better shape and ready to get after it a little more. We're cautiously optimistic. It's a wait-and-see approach. Obviously, it would be a major boon for us if he's healthy.\" \n\nMLB Now: Dodgers' pitching The guys on MLB Now discuss Dodgers' 2017 pitchingOn MLB Now, the crew discusses the Los Angeles Dodgers' plans for their 2017 starting rotation \n\nMcCarthy, whose recovery from Tommy John surgery was complicated by a case of the yips, said he's throwing off a mound at max velocity with no control issues and that he's also ready to reclaim his rotation spot. \n\nFriedman said Wood is back to starting after returning from in-season elbow surgery last year as a reliever. \n\n\"I'm coming in as a starter and that's where I expect to stay,\" said Wood, who has thrown off a mound twice in the past week. \n\n@Dodgers fans this is RIDICULOUS!! What an awesome day!! Tag yourself if you're in the picture!! @kikehndez pic.twitter.com/DRn3rzIKnf \n\n- Alex Wood (@Awood45) January 28, 2017 \n\nAlthough Wood pitched in relief successfully, most of the \"extra\" starters are considered starting pitchers by the Dodgers, not relievers, and shuffling back and forth is not ideal. \n\n\"It's obviously tricky in that once you do it, it just becomes that much harder to build them back up as starters,\" Friedman said. \"We'll have to factor all of that in, and it depends what our bullpen looks like, whether we have injuries or not in Spring Training.

But then Nadal began to dominate with his crushing forehand, and Federer started to struggle. \n\nNadal did not drop serve again until he tried to close out the match at 5-4 in the fourth. He clinched the match soon after in the tiebreak, winning his 14th consecutive final. \n\nThe pressure was on Federer as top seed and a three-time defending champion, riding a 47-match grass court win streak against someone who had struggled previously on the surface. \n\nFederer started strongly, breaking Nadal in the second, fourth and sixth games to take the set 6-0. The Spaniard managed to strike back with a break in the first game of the second set but failed to close it out. \n\nFederer then narrowly took the second set in a tiebreak 7-5 but lost the third, also in a tiebreak. In the tense fourth, Federer took early control, breaking twice for 4-1 before capturing his 39th career title and eighth Grand Slam crown. \n\nThe stakes were high with Federer attempting to become just the sixth man in history to win all four Grand Slam titles and only the third man to hold all four majors at the same time. Nadal was looking to win three consecutive Roland Garros crowns. \n\nThe Swiss took the fight to the Spaniard early, earning 10 break point chances over three consecutive Nadal service games. But the tough Spaniard refused to buckle and he scrapped to win the first set. \n\nAlthough Federer rebounded to win the second set, Nadal's ability to fight off break point opportunities and his high-kicking left-handed forehands were the telling factors and too much for Federer to handle. \n\nIn a repeat of the 2006 final, a never-day-die Nadal pushed four-time champion Federer to five sets for the first time in his 34-match winning streak at the All England Club. \n\nFederer, who had never lost a match at Wimbledon after winning the first set, claimed the crucial first set tiebreak despite Nadal's gallant efforts. But Nadal's blistering passes and serve and volley kept him in the match. \n\nIt was a close contest until Federer claimed a decisive break in the sixth game of the fifth set to equal Borg's record of five consecutive Wimbledon titles. \n\nIn their 17th career meeting, much was expected of Federer but it proved to be the most one-sided encounter between the pair. \n\nNadal broke Federer's serve in the first game and from there he didn't look back with the Swiss hitting too many unforced errors and failing to take his opportunities. \n\nThe third set lasted just 27 minutes as Nadal broke serve three times and hand Federer his first bagel set since June 1999. \n\nFederer was looking to clinch his 13th career Grand Slam title and sixth straight Wimbledon trophy in one of the most eagerly anticipated matches of their long rivalry. \n\nNadal won the first set and trailed Federer 3-0 in the second but he fought back to silence the crowd. The third set was interrupted by rain with Federer eventually clinching it on his third set point 7-5. \n\nThe fourth set also moved into an inevitable tiebreak with Federer rallying to take it to fifth. Rain hit the match in the decider and as darkness fell Nadal finally converted his fourth match point in the longest Wimbledon final in history, lasting four hours, 48 minutes. \n\nHistory was again at stake with Federer looking to equal Pete Sampras' all-time record of 14 Grand Slam titles, while for Nadal it was a chance to become Spain's first Australian Open champion. \n\nNadal had beaten Fernando Verdasco in five hours and 14 minutes - then the Australian Open's longest-ever match - in the semis, while Federer had 24 hours more to recover. \n\nBoth Nadal proved he was mentally and physically stronger, punishing a poorly-serving Federer to become the first man since Goran Ivanisevic in 2001 to win a Grand Slam with five-set victories in the semi-finals and final. \n\nThis was Nadal and Federer's eighth and last meeting in a Grand Slam final and having ended Novak Djokovic's 41-match unbeaten run in the semi-finals, the Swiss was hoping his form would be enough to dethrone Nadal. \n\nHe made a strong start as he raced to a 5-2 lead but Nadal then reeled off five straight games to take the opener. He capitalised on his momentum and kept his composure in the tie-break to take a commanding two-set lead. \n\nA resilient Federer delighted the crowd in a tough third set as he clawed his way back into the match, but he squandered break point opportunities on Nadal's opening serve in the fourth and from there the tide swiftly turned. \n\nShare this article: \n\nFeatured Story \n\nAfghanistan's Defense Ministry says it wants to raise the number of women serving in the Afghan National Army to a level where women comprise 10 percent of the force. \n\nDefense Ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanesh said on January 27 that the government had set several measures, including a special salary scale for female recruits, to encourage more women to join up. \n\n'At this stage, we have 1,575 Afghan women in our army ranks, it is a mere 3 to 4 percent -- which is nothing,' Radmanesh said.

Take a look at the Cubs' process across town with Jon Lester and Jason Heyward as examples. \n\nHahn acknowledged the team is much closer to the beginning than the end in assembling the critical mass of young talent, a phrase he used enough over the past few days to turn it into a marketing slogan once the prospects all arrive at the big league level. But Hahn has no doubt White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf will be willing to spend and supplement. \n\nSoxFest features young White Sox Future of the White Sox on display at SoxFestYoan Moncada, Lucas Giolito and Michael Kopech discuss how happy they are to be a part of the White Sox organization at SoxFest \n\n\"When the time comes,\" Hahn told MLB.com. \"When the time comes, we will be prepared to be aggressive, and free agency is used usually as a means to round out a championship-caliber roster. We know that's part of this. We are obviously not there at this time, but when the time comes, we are prepared to be aggressive. \n\n\"Jerry has been on board in support of this from the start. He's as competitive as anybody. He's as impatient as anybody. He hopes ideally that we get this thing done as quickly as possible. \n\n\"But I think the most beneficial part of his faith is that he's not making us force the issue. He wants us to only make transactions if we feel it truly does serve the greater good for the long term, not just because any of us are impatient and we have to go do something.\" \n\nThat philosophy explains in part why an All-Star such as Jose Quintana remains on target to start Opening Day for the White Sox and isn't pitching for Pittsburgh or Houston. There has been extensive interest in acquiring the southpaw, but no talent offering submitted yet to make Hahn complete the deal. \n\nAs for the trades already done -- Chris Sale to Boston and Adam Eaton to Washington -- Hahn clearly stated on a couple of occasions these moves had everything to do with the return and absolutely nothing to do with these players' outspoken demeanor off the field. \n\nThis rebuild was not born out of bad contracts or players who had to be moved. It was, simply put, born out of the lack of success from the previous plan, in which the White Sox consistently pushed for the postseason but also were left trying to piece together a competitive roster through the lower side of free agency. \n\nOften times the general manager in charge of that unsuccessful regime doesn't get a chance to improve on a wrongdoing, as Hahn and executive vice president Ken Williams currently are doing. Hahn understands that concept, but the White Sox brain trust also knew this rebuild day was coming even in the midst of trying to contend. \n\n\"We've had this conversation, Jerry, Kenny and I, for a number of years, about when is the right time to pivot and how are we going to approach this pivot when the time does come?\" Hahn said. \"Ultimately we decided mid-way through last year that yes, it's finally time, and here's how we are going to go about it. Ultimately we weren't able to do the large transactions until the offseason.\" \n\nScott Merkin has covered the White Sox for MLB.com since 2003.

But it is also about the possibilities. \n \nImagining what can be done when three superstars have all sorts of extra open ice as their playground. Even the three greatest to have ever laced up skates mused about it. \n \nAs he looked over at Bobby Orr and Mario Lemieux, Wayne Gretzky said, \u201cThe three of us would have been pretty good in three-on-three.\u201d \n \nTime moves on, of course, and new generations of stars emerge. As this year\u2019s midseason showcase commences on Sunday at Staples Center, the current All-Stars seemed to focus on what is possible each time Connor McDavid goes over the boards. \n \nA line to play some shifts with him may already be forming. \n \n\u201cI\u2019d like to sit behind the net and have Connor get all his speed and just pick the puck up,\u201d said the Ducks\u2019 Cam Fowler, who got his first nod. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll just watch him do his thing. I think that\u2019ll be fun.\u201d \n \nMcDavid, the 20-year-old supernova of the Edmonton Oilers, is a reflection of the super-skilled youth becoming the brightest lights for the NHL to shine. It is his first All-Star game, as is for two leading contenders for the Calder Trophy as this season\u2019s top rookie \u2013 Toronto\u2019s Auston Matthews and Winnipeg\u2019s Patrik Laine. \n \nMatthews, 19, exemplifies the growth of the league into its non-traditional markets. Born in San Ramon, California, and raised primarily in Scottsdale, Arizona, the Maple Leafs\u2019 star is delivering on his selection as the No. 1 overall pick of the 2016 draft. \n \nAlready, Matthews has the modern-day NHL record for goals in his debut when he scored four times. His 23 goals put him among the league leaders and he\u2019s counting on getting his share of scoring chances. \u201cIt\u2019d be embarrassing if I didn\u2019t,\u201d he said on Saturday, sitting at a table in a hotel ballroom. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be really tiring,\u201d Matthews continued. \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of fun. \u201cThree-on-three in overtime, it\u2019s always exciting. Always kind of nerve-wracking. It gets you on the edge of your seat. A lot of space out there. Especially with all the skill in this room, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a good show.\u201d \n \nA simple fact remains as the game\u2019s format has changed throughout the years. Defense is optional. Jeff Carter joked that his Kings teammate, Drew Doughty, won\u2019t be playing much of it and that San Jose star Brent Burns \u201cis basically a forward out there.\u201d \n \n \nWhen it came to his wish of players to take shifts with, Carter had no particulars. \n \n\u201cI mean, everybody, right?\u201d said Carter, who leads the Kings with 24 goals. \u201c\u201dIt\u2019s an All-Star game. Obviously I\u2019m sure everybody wants to get a couple shifts with Connor. (Johnny) Gaudreau. \u2026 I think for my game, it could work out pretty well hopefully. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d \n \nMcDavid was voted in as captain of the Pacific, which won the first 3-on-3 tournament last season. San Jose coach Peter DeBoer is eager to have fun with the \u201cworld-class talent\u201d at his disposal but may have an ulterior motive at work. \u201cJust enjoy it and double-shift McDavid,\u201d DeBoer chirped. \n \n\u201cI\u2019d like to see maybe some combinations that maybe they can come up with,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cYou get Gaudreau and Burns out there with a Carter or somebody. Have Gaudreau do his thing with the two shooters. \n \n\u201cThe possibilities are endless. If I\u2019m excited about it as a player, I can only imagine what fans and people watching the game are excited about it as well.\u201d \n \nThe divisional format has Alex Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby as teammates for the Metropolitan, pushing aside their rivalry for a weekend. Ovechkin is preparing to be put in a different position by Gretzky, who is substituting as coach for Columbus\u2019s John Tortorella. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to ask the coach who is going (to play on which) line and who the lines are going to be,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s going to be fun. It\u2019s going to be some new lines \u2026 We\u2019re going to go over the system (and see if) I\u2019m going to be the shot-blocker or defenseman.\u201d \n \nWhen it was suggested that Ovechkin will be the playmaker for Crosby, Washington\u2019s three-time league MVP cracked, \u201cYeah, we\u2019ve switched positions.\u201d \n \nIn what could be his first of many, Matthews is trying to take it all in. \n \n\u201cYou meet everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look around, you see a lot of great history and a lot of great players. A lot of past players that are Hall of Famers who have had unbelievable careers.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"San Jose news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Sports: ice hockey news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NHL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Youth fountaining through NHL All-Star Game","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"90503","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Torrance","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Breeze","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169676533","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"296"},"name":"Daily Breeze","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailybreeze.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196249839","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Clippers, meanwhile, hadn't previously lost by more than 26 this year. \n\nCurry swished a 51-foot buzzer-beater at the end of the second quarter, but his best was yet to come. \n\nHe connected on eight of his 11 shots, including five of his eight 3-point attempts in the third quarter, during which the Warriors went for 45 points and ran off to a 117-74 lead. \n\nDespite not playing in the fourth period, Curry recorded his third 40-point game of the season and came within three of his season-high, set in November against New Orleans. \n\nKevin Durant contributed 23 points and a team-high seven assists, and Klay Thompson had 16 points for the Warriors, who notched their fifth straight home win. \n\nCurry (9-for-15), Durant (3-for-4) and Thompson (2-for-3) combined for 14-for-22 shooting from 3-point range, as the Warriors made half their 34 attempts from beyond the arc as a team. \n\nCurry also found time for a team-high nine rebounds and six assists, helping Golden State gain a 48-32 advantage on the boards and record 30-plus assists for the 31st time this season with 35.

Redick added 13 points for Los Angeles (30-18), which hasn't beaten the Warriors in the regular season since Christmas Day in 2014. \n\nThe Clippers fell to 1-4 since losing star guard Chris Paul to thumb surgery. \n\nThe Warriors gained an immediate upper hand in the game when Griffin drew two early fouls and was pulled in the contest's fifth minute. \n\nGolden State went up by as many as 11 in the quarter, then pulled away with a 41-point second period that featured 5-for-5 shooting on 3-pointers. Curry had two threes in the run, including his curtain-closer on the half from one step beyond half court. \n\nThe Warriors led 72-51 at halftime. \n\nNOTES: Warriors PG Stephen Curry had been questionable for the game because of a sore quad, but he passed a pregame test during warmups and was cleared to play. Curry and F Kevin Durant are the only Warriors to have played in all 47 games this season. ...

And they do their homework. It makes for a fun time answering those questions.\" \n\nThis seminar featured questions for the trio of White Sox, ranging from favorite cereal to favorite food to what profession they would hold if they weren't baseball players. Frazier went with Cinnamon Toast Crunch, French fries and math teacher. \n\nThere also were more than a few interesting baseball-related inquiries. \n\nOne astute young fan asked Frazier if he would do a bat flip if he ever connected for a home run off Sale, his friend, former teammate and now potential opponent with the Red Sox. Frazier played a strong diplomatic role by saying that he might do one because it's not very easy to connect off one of the game's best pitchers, but he hoped Sale would take it in good fun because he didn't want a fastball in the ribs. \n\n\"That was impressive,\" Frazier said of the Sale question. \"I hope I can hit a home run off of him so I get an opportunity to do it.\" \n\nAnother fan asked Frazier for his career home run total, and he missed by seven when stating 155 (148 actually). That question was followed by a youngster asking Rodon for his career strikeout total, which Rodon didn't know, but another young fan gave him the correct answer of 307. \n\nA final challenge for Frazier came when asked if he would rather hit a home run in every at-bat or win a World Series as a team but be really bad individually after the championship. Following a good laugh from the panel and throughout the Continental Ballroom, Frazier went with the World Series. \n\nConnecting with the youngest White Sox supporters was the most important factor during these 45 minutes. But a good time was had by all. \n\n\"We are here basically for the kids,\" Frazier said. \"I'll stop on a dime just to give a kid a smile and an autograph and a picture. This is what a fanfest is about. The kids up and coming to be true White Sox fans and they grow loving this team.\" \n\nScott Merkin has covered the White Sox for MLB.com since 2003.

He began building Rock Gate Part in Florida City around 1923. At the time, Florida City was an isolated community. In 1936, Leedskalnin moved himself and his castle 10 miles north to its present position in Homestead, where he continued to work on it until 1951. The enduring mystery of the Castle is how one man could carve and move the massive stones used. The stones are made of Oolite, a sedimentary rock commonly found in southern Florida. They are carefully placed one on top of the other, with no mortar to seal them. The craftsmanship is perfect \u2013 connecting stones around the perimeter wall are uniform in height, and despite the lack of mortar, the stones sit perfectly against one another.

Actually, following the predictions of Nostradamus, one assumedly major nuclear confrontation will possibly happen in the area in which the aggressor is the one breaking the promise of not using the nuclear weapons or its violent power in any warfare. The sad tidings here would be how the naval fleets would go kept by other powers, and then they could get scattered due to the violence of the powerful blast.\n\nDuring the course of 2014 to present day 2015 we have seen a huge up-tick in global military action, in some countries we have even seen military personnel on the streets and in the homes and businesses of the people who they are paid to protect. We have seen global governments pushing and prodding each other into position of war via proxy wars, economic wars, as the war on humanity is what takes centre stage Enchanted LifePath Alternate Media Reports takes a closer look at exactly what countries are invoked in military procedures at home or abroad throughout the world.\n\nLETS LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE IN MORE DETAIL\n\nWith the world inching closer to war, many historians, Biblical scholars and fans of Nostradamus are pointing to the current Middle East conflict between Israel and Iran. Global alliances could quickly turn a 2-nation war into a regional war, and then into a world war. How would the US fair and who would be on our side? We divided the world based on current alliances to see how the two sides match up and who has the edge.\n\nThe following battle lines were researched and chosen exclusively by Whiteout Press. We used a number of criteria to make our decision for each nation. Among the items we considered were; current military alliances, religious affiliations, historical alliances, ethnic ties, trade relations and statements by national leaders right out of today\u2019s headlines.\n\nJudaism vs. Islam, Christian civil war\n\nAs the world map is laid out, one of the trends we immediately notice is that the former Soviet nations and their Eastern Orthodox Christian faith will follow-up on their current promise and come to the aid of their Islamic allies in any war against the United States. With the Soviets come the global Communists, including some right in America\u2019s backyard.\n\nThe Neutrals\n\nIt is inevitable that many nations will attempt to remain neutral. But in the global world we live in, there is no such thing as neutrality. Nations that can\u2019t fight for or buy their neutrality, like India and Switzerland, will simply be used like pawns in a chess game by the world\u2019s superpowers. We did take history into account and countries like Nepal, Nigeria and Sweden who have always fought for and won their neutrality during regional wars are labeled as neutral again here.\n\nOther neutral countries are marked that way for a different reason. Some countries around the globe are so devastated and disoriented by current civil wars, they have no functioning government able to take any side. Some might conclude that a few of these civil wars are the first wave of the possible coming World War 3. In many instances, the wars are between militant Christians and Islamic Jihadists.\n\nThe numbers and statistics\n\nWe\u2019ve left out nuclear weapons capabilities, as well as chemical and biological weapons. Nations don\u2019t typically disclose their actual arsenal and half the nuclear-armed countries still don\u2019t acknowledge they have the weapons of mass destruction. Another reason to leave them off the list is pure wishful thinking. For if World War 3 is in fact a nuclear war instead of a conventional war, there will be nobody left to read these words anyway.\n\nIn the cases of some small nations without any military or published information, we had to make our best guess.

The higher the frequency of sound, the more complex the shapes become. Some of the shapes have been compared to traditional mandala designs. Galileo first wrote about in 1632, describing how he scraped a brass plate with an iron chisel. At times the plate emitted a high-pitched sound, and at these times fine parallel streaks appeared. In 1680, Robert Hooke repeated the experiment using a glass plate covered with flour. As he ran a bow along the edge of the plate, the patterns emerged in the flour.

The script began as pictographs, simple pictures, though over time the symbols became more abstract. To create cuneiform script, a scribe would use a stylus, a blunt reed, to make impressions on wet clay tablets. The stylus left wedge-shaped impressions, leading to the named cuneiform (\u201cwedge shaped\u201d). Cuneiform started with the Sumerians around 3000 B.C. In the following diagram, we can see how pictographs (Stage one, 3000 B.C.) gradually led to Assyrian cuneiform (Stage seven, early first millennium until its extinction around 75 A.D.). Early pictograms were not wedge-shaped. Beginning around 2900 B.C., pictographs began to change. The context could change the meaning of a given sign. By the mid-third millennium, writing changed. Writing was done from left to right in horizontal rows, much as we do now. This caused pictograms to rotate 90° counterclockwise, while the new stylus produced true cuneiform script. Symbols were scratched into play. If a permanent record was desired, the cuneiform tablets were fired in kilns.

Meanwhile Nadal is bidding to become the first man since 1968 to win each of the four major titles twice. \n\nIt will be Federer's sixth Australian Open final and 28th Grand Slam decider in total, and caps a marvellous comeback after the second half of last season was ruined by a knee injury, with his ranking dipping to 17. \n\nNadal, the ninth seed in Melbourne, has also been out of the Grand Slam limelight since his last title success at Roland Garros in 2014, as injuries sidetracked his glorious career. \n\nBoth have a deep respect and admiration for each other. Federer even travelled to Mallorca for the opening of Nadal's tennis academy last October. \n\n\"I just think he's an incredible tennis player. He's got shots that no other one has. When you have that, you are unique and special,\" Federer said of Nadal. \n\n\"Plus he's got the grit. He's got the mental and physical ability to sustain a super high level of play for years and for hours and for weeks. \n\n\"I think he's been tremendous for the game. I have a lot of respect for him on many levels.\" \n\nNadal underlined that reputation with his gripping win in Friday's semi-final which was on a par with some of his very best matches. \n\nThe Spaniard, who is into his fourth Australian decider and 21st Grand Slam title match, says his rivalry with Federer is one that draws notice from outside of tennis. \n\n\"It's the combination of two different styles that makes the matches really special,\" he said. \n\n\"It's a different way to play tennis. Both of us have a lot of good success with these two different styles. \n\n\"I feel that this rivalry goes (beyond) the tennis world. People from outside of our world talks about this, and that's good for our sport.\" \n\nShare this article: \n\nFeatured Story \n\nAfghanistan's Defense Ministry says it wants to raise the number of women serving in the Afghan National Army to a level where women comprise 10 percent of the force. \n\nDefense Ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanesh said on January 27 that the government had set several measures, including a special salary scale for female recruits, to encourage more women to join up. \n\n'At this stage, we have 1,575 Afghan women in our army ranks, it is a mere 3 to 4 percent -- which is nothing,' Radmanesh said.

The loss drops the Cyclones to 13-7 overall on the season, while the Commodores improved to 10-11. \n  \nISU got up by as many as 11 points in the first half, but the home team was able to fight back to a tie at half time. The momentum carried into the second half as Vanderbilt got up by as many as 15 points behind a strong shooting afternoon from deep. ISU was down 14 with 3:28 to go, but cut the advantage down to four points in the final seconds, but ran out of time to complete the comeback. \n \nMorris finished with 25 points on 10-of-17 shooting.

Donovan Jackson came off the bench for 16 points, while Matt Thomas had 14 and Deonte Burton 13. \n \nHow it Happened \nVanderbilt ran out to an 8-2 advantage in the first three minutes, but the Cyclones got rolling, hitting six-straight shots, including three 3-pointers by Matt Thomas to open up a 17-10 lead on the Commodores. The Cyclone bench stepped up to help bring the ISU advantage to double figures, as Donovan Jackson had five-straight points to make it 26-15 to the visitors. \n \nThe Commodores were able to shoot their way back within sight of ISU, as they were able to cut the Cyclone advantage back down to two. Monté Morris made a couple of shots to keep ISU in front, but VU was able to close stronger with Nolan Cressler hitting a 3-pointer with 21 seconds remaining to knot the score up at the half, 33-33. \n \nIt only took 15 seconds for Vanderbilt to move ahead in the second half, and the Commodores would take their lead out to a then-game-high seven points at 42-35. Vanderbilt's shooting started to get involved, as they moved up to 14 points at 58-44 behind the shooting of Matthew Fisher-Davis. \n \nStill down 14 with 3:28 to go, the Cyclones made a final run at the contest. Iowa State got buckets across the spectrum, with Morris, Thomas, Deonte Burton and Jackson all contributing to the ISU comeback.

Kennedy International Airport, their lawyers and two U.S. representatives accompanying them tried to cross into a secure area - and were stopped themselves. \n \n\"Step back! Step back!\" the agents shouted at them. \n \nA few minutes later, Heidi Nassauer, chief of passenger operations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the airport, was called over. \n \nRepresentatives Jerrold Nadler and Nydia Velazquez, both Democrats from New York, wanted clarification on whether an immigration ban issued on Friday by President Donald Trump prevented the Iraqis from consulting with attorneys. \n \nNassauer had no clear answer. \n \n\"We are as much in the dark as everybody else,\" said the border protection official at one of the largest U.S. airports. \n \nThe tense exchange, witnessed by Reuters, was representative of the confusion at airports across the United States and others overseas after Trump abruptly halted immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries and temporarily put a stop to the entry of refugees. \n \nThroughout much of Saturday, government officials and security workers were left to guess who from those countries could enter the United States legally and who could not. \n \nThe day ended with a federal judge issuing an emergency stay that temporarily allowed stranded travelers with valid visas to remain in the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the stay, said it would help 100 to 200 people with visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports. \n \nRECKLESS \n \nEarlier on Saturday, the Trump administration said it would have been \"reckless\" to brief government agencies and airports more broadly in advance of launching the security measures, which it says are aimed at preventing attacks from foreign groups. \n \nBut career officials in the Homeland Security and State departments told Reuters the administration failed to appreciate the complexity of enforcing the order consistently or the need to prepare agencies and airlines. \n \nAffected travelers had varying experiences at different airports, according to nearly 200 accounts gathered by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA). \n \nMany holding visas told the association they were allowed into the country without a problem despite Trump's executive order banning them. \n \nBut some lawful permanent residents - those with so-called green cards - were turned away despite guidance to airlines from the CBP that they should be allowed to travel. \n \nAt about 10 p.m. on Friday in Seattle, some eight hours after Trump signed the executive order, an Iranian with dual Canadian citizenship from Vancouver was sent back to Canada, the traveler reported to AILA. A half hour later in New York City, an Iranian arrived at JFK and entered the United States on a valid visa without any problems, according to AILA. \n \nA senior administration official said Trump's order - aimed at citizens of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - needed to be implemented urgently to protect Americans. \n \n\"There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official told reporters in a briefing. \"It would be reckless and irresponsible to ... broadcast to the entire world the exact security measures you're going to take.\" \n \nKey figures at the Department of Homeland Security were informed, the official said, declining to elaborate. \n \n\"I'm not at liberty to reveal exactly who was briefed and who wasn't briefed, but everyone that needed to be briefed was briefed,\" the official said. \n \nOUT OF THE LOOP \n \nAt the State Department, one of the main agencies dealing with visas and immigration, most officials first heard of the executive order on immigration through the media, according to two department officials. \n \nWhile some offices were aware an executive order was coming, there was no official communication or consultation from the White House, they said. \n \n\"Was there any inter-agency coordination or consultation? No,\" said one senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \n \nImmigration enforcement is among the federal government's most complex endeavors, involving seven agencies from the U.S. Coast Guard and CBP to the State and Justice Departments. \n \nTwo senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security said on Saturday that they had not heard of any officials in the relevant agencies - or the congressional committees and subcommittees that oversee them - who had been consulted by anyone who helped draft the president's order. \n \n\"If the result is confusion and inconsistency, the responsibility all lies at one address,\" said one of the officials, referring to the White House. \n \nThe official, like others, requested anonymity to discuss Trump's order. \n \nAnother Homeland Security official told Reuters that the White House worked on the executive orders with \"limited department participation.\" \n \n\"It has been a challenge but folks are working through it,\" the official said. \n \nCHAOS AT AIRPORTS \n \nOne of the Iraqis detained at JFK was Hameed Khalid Darweesh, a 53-year-old Kurd who had worked as a U.S. Army translator in Iraq and had been threatened there for helping the Americans. \n \nVisas for him and his family were finally issued on Jan. 20, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of Darweesh and another Iraqi, who had also worked with U.S. military. But as soon as he landed at JFK, he was detained by CBP officers and barred from contacting his attorneys. \n \nWhen his attorneys, from the International Refugee Assistance Project, asked the CBP officers whom they could contact, the agents responded, \"Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,\" according to the lawsuit. \n \nEventually, Darweesh was allowed to leave and met the lawmakers and his lawyers, clutching his passport and weeping with joy. The other Iraqi who was detained, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was also allowed to enter the country. \n \nBut dozens of others were less fortunate. \n \nConflicting media and government reports caused confusion for airlines struggling to deal with the order. \n \nCBP informed air carriers about the executive order in a conference call late on Friday, said a person familiar with the agency's communications. CBP then sent written guidance before noon on Saturday saying that green card holders were \"not included\" in the ban and could continue to travel to the United States. The source said airlines were allowing travelers with green cards on flights until told otherwise. \n \nThe Trump administration official later told reporters that U.S. green card holders traveling outside the United States need to check with a U.S. consulate to see whether they can return. \n \n\"It's being cleared on a case-by-case basis,\" the official said. \n \nThe green card issue has left immigration attorneys confused about how to advise their clients. Attorney David Leopold, from Cleveland, Ohio, said he is erring on the side of caution, advising his clients to stay in the United States to avoid being stranded abroad. \n \nThat can create some agonizing dilemmas. \n \n\"A Syrian doctor who has a dying mother in Europe cannot go visit her not knowing that he will be able to get back into the United States,\" Leopold said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"How Trump's abrupt immigration ban sowed confusion at airports, agencies","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Today India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"196774332","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Business Today India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://businesstoday.intoday.in"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196260109","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

For most of the season, the New Orleans Pelicans oscillated between hot and cold. \n\nThe Pelicans (19-28) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers and the red-hot San Antonio Spurs at home this week, mixed around lopsided losses to the Oklahoma City Thunder and the NBA-worst Brooklyn Nets. \n\nSo when the Pelicans host the Wizards (26-20) -- winners of 10 of their last 12 games -- at the Smoothie King Center on Sunday, it's anyone's guess which New Orleans team will show up. \n\n\"The only thing that I keep telling these guys, and I really believe it, is if we play to the level we are capable of playing, then we can beat anybody,\" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said. \"I do believe that. Obviously, this week we have kind of proven that with wins over the world champs (Cleveland) and a team that's going to have an opportunity to win a championship (San Antonio). \n\n\"That says a lot. But we keep going back to that word consistency. We have to do it night in and night out, and we can't just do it against the great teams.\" \n\nIn routing the Spurs 119-103 on Friday night, the Pelicans stunned the Spurs with a 71-46 second half, including a 34-19 fourth quarter. \n\nEven more impressive was that the victory came without a lot of heroics from Anthony Davis. The All-Star forward scored only seven points in the 71-point second half, but appears recovered from a right thigh bruise that limited him earlier in the week. \n\n\"We just can't show up for teams that are top-tier teams,\" Davis said. \"We've got to come out and play well against everybody, no matter their record or no matter what it says on the front of their jerseys. We're a great team, and we've got to realize that and play like this every night. The Wizards have been playing well since late December into January. We've got to make sure we play the same way -- defend and get out and run. If we do that, we can take care of business.\" \n\nThe Wizards won seven of their last eight games and are 10-4 in January, including a 112-86 rout of the Atlanta Hawks on the road Friday night. The 26-point victory was their most lopsided of the season and moved the Wizards within a half-game of the Hawks for fourth place in the Eastern Conference. The Hawks came into the game having won 12 of 15. \n\nJohn Wall led Washington with 19 points to go with nine assists and six rebounds. Backcourt mate Bradley Beal added 15 points. \n\n\"We're a totally different team,\" Beal said. \"In every way. Our confidence, our swag as a team. Everything is a lot better.\" \n\nThe Wizards won four of their last six road games. Washington has not trailed in a game for 141 minutes, 50 seconds, the longest active streak in the NBA. The Wizards also have won eight of the last nine games against the Pelicans. \n\nThe Wizards are an Eastern Conference best 20-9 since Dec. 1 and are 23-11 since starting the season 3-9. They also have had consecutive 10-win months for the first time since 2006-07. \n\n\"That means we're doing something good the last two months,\" Washington coach Scott Brooks said. \"Guys are playing well. We're very confident, but we're not overconfident.

We know how good we are. Tonight we played unselfish, and it showed. We had the next man in mentality, and we knew we had to be that much better.\" \n \nEllingson was one of four Iowa players to score in double figures as head coach Fran McCaffery's team improved to 4-5 in Big Ten play and 12-10 overall. \n \nMcCaffery's message to Ellingson all season has been to be more aggressive offensively. \n \n\"He made a concerted effort, starting with the first one he made,\" McCaffery said. \"He came right off, bang, and kind of set the tone that that's what he was going to do tonight. I would like to see him be like that on a regular basis, be aggressive and look for his shot. It's OK if you miss a couple, just keep attacking.\" \n \nThe other three double figure scorers were freshmen. Ryan Kriener had 14 points, made 6-of-7 shots from the field and also grabbed a career-high seven rebounds. \n \n\"Everyone feels good coming off a good game,\" Kriener said. \"I was glad to come in and do my part to help the team.\" \n \nMost impressive were a pair of offensive rebounds Kriener dug out early in the second half. Both second-chance possessions led to Ellingson 3-pointers. \n \n\"Brady and I play together every day in practice,\" Kriener said. \"We're always on the same team. He's a good catch-and-shoot guy. If I can ever get him an open look, that's what I'm going to try and do. If he's shooting the ball, that's good for our team.\" \n \nTyler Cook scored 10 of his 13 points the second half, making 4-of-6 shots. Jordan Bohannon scored nine of his 12 points in the first half. That included a deep 3-pointer in the final seconds of the first half that gave Iowa a 40-29 lead. \n \nMcCaffery saw plenty of positives in the box score. There was Nicholas Baer's game-high eight rebounds. Dom Uhl and Cordell Pemsl combined for 11 assists to two turnovers. Iowa had just three second-half turnovers and nine for the game. Baer had three of the Hawkeyes' five blocked shots. \n \nIowa shot 50 percent from the field in both halves, and moved the ball with great efficiency for most of the 40 minutes. \n \n\"We had 44 bench points,\" McCaffery said. \"Dom Uhl and Cordell Pemsl, 11 assists to two turns. There are so many things -- our shooting percentage and our ball movement was better. There's a reason why you make 50 percent of your shots. If you move the ball, you're shooting more open shots.\" \n \nAdd it all up, and McCaffery's big-picture take was just as impressive. \n \n\"I have a lot of respect for this team (Ohio State), for this program, for Thad (Matta),\" McCaffery said. \"For us to execute the way we did, I think is a big step for our program.\" \n \nThe medical staff decided Friday to shut Jok down and see if the rest will help his ailing back. McCaffery said Jok's availability will be determined on a day-to-day basis. \n \nBut Jok was engaged in the locker room before the game, and on the sidelines during it. He encouraged his teammates through good and bad moments. \n \n\"He challenged everyone in the locker room to step up,\" Kriener said. \n \nJok, the Big Ten's leading scorer at 21 points a game, had a streak of 52 consecutive starts end Saturday. This was the first game he has missed since a Nov. 15, 2015, contest against Coppin State. \n \nBut his leadership skills were on display, even though his shooting skills weren't. \n \n\"He promised me he would do that,\" McCaffery said. \"It's not only what he did, because some guys will do it when everybody is watching. He did it Friday when nobody was watching, and he did it in the locker room when nobody was there. I'm proud of him there.\" \n \nThe Hawkeyes return to action Tuesday at Rutgers. Tip time is 6 p.m. (CT), and the game will be televised on BTN.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Hawkeyes beat Ohio State to get back in win column","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Linn","zipCode":"52406","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Cedar Rapids","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KCRG.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662333","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1399"},"name":"KCRG.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kcrg.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196262258","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Shorter converted 33.3% of its shots. \n \nUnion jumped out to an early 10-0 lead before Mike Wickliff got the Hawks on the board with a three-pointer. \n \nWickliff's three did little to stall the Bulldogs momentum, as they led by 25, 38-13, before Shorter was able to begin cutting into the deficit. \n \nThe Hawks managed to cut six points off of Union's advantage, making the score 46-27, when Amonte Potter hit a three with 4:09 left until halftime, but Union again extended its lead to 25, before Phil Taylor's free throws sent Shorter to the locker room down 53-30. \n \nThe Hawks began to make a comeback with nine minutes remaining in the second half. It started when Warren Helligar made a pair of free throws, making Shorter's deficit 24 points. \n \nOver the next five minutes, the Hawks got as close as 14 points when Helligar nailed a three-pointer for his sixth points of the night. \n \nThe Bulldogs did not allow Shorter to get closer than 14, taking a 20-point lead before Taylor cut it to 17 with a three. \n \nThe two squads traded baskets in the final two minutes and Taylor hit two free throws with 30 seconds left, but Union left Rome with a 75-61 victory. \n \nThe Bulldogs improve to 11-9 and 6-8 in the Gulf South Conference, while Shorter falls to 11-8 overall and 5-8 in GSC action. \n \nThe two teams split the season series, with each squad winning on the opponent's home floor. \n \nEach team had four players in double figures.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2794","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Cowra","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Cowra Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169757142","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Cowra Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.cowraguardian.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196280516","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2794","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Cowra","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Cowra Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169757142","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Cowra Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.cowraguardian.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196282133","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

If a player is a citizen of one of the banned countries, he would need to obtain a \"case-by-case waiver\" in order to be able to re-enter the US. \n \nOfficials at the Department of Homeland Security stated that, in order to qualify for the waiver, the situation must be \"in the national interest\". \n \nMaker, who was born in what is now South Sudan, is in a somewhat confusing situation. \n \nSudan, not South Sudan, is on the list of banned countries but, when Maker was born, his country of birth was considered the former. It was only in 2011 when South Sudan gained its independence from Sudan. \n \nMaker's passport, which is Australian, was observed by foxsports.com.au in 2016, and lists his birth place as Wau, which is now a city in South Sudan. If the State Department considers Wau as part of South Sudan, then the seven-footer isn't expected to be affected, though that has yet to be confirmed. \n \nOn Friday evening, just hours after the order was put into place, Maker was able to travel from Canada to the US without incident, though it's not known whether that was because the order was still in its infancy at the time, or whether that's the ongoing policy of the Trump administration. \n \nThis scenario would also be the case for Thon's younger brother, Matur, who's currently playing high school basketball in Canada. \n \nLuol Deng, the Los Angeles Lakers forward, was also born in Wau, and holds dual citizenship with the United Kingdom. \n \nSome of Australia's South Sudanese athletes playing college basketball are also likely to be unaffected by the ban. Louisville's Deng Adel was born in Juba, South Sudan, while Mangok Mathiang, also a Louisville Cardinal, is known to have been born in a city that's now a part of the Republic of South Sudan. \n \nOne athlete that may be affected by the ban is the University of Kentucky's Wenyen Gabriel, who was born in Khartoum, Sudan. If he were to leave the US, he wouldn't be able to immediately re-enter, unless he obtained a special waiver, which currently has an ambiguous qualification process. \n \nOn Saturday, a federal judge blocked a portion of the President's order, ordering that those trapped in airports and transit stations across the US should not be sent back to their home country. The judge stopped short of allowing those people into the US. \n \nThe NBA released a statement on Saturday saying: \"We have reached out to the State Department and are in the process of gathering information to understand how this executive order would apply to players in our league who are from one of the impacted countries. The NBA is a global league and we are proud to attract the very best players from around the world.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"South Sudan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"How Trump's immigration order could affect...","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4343","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Gatton","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Gatton Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664661","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"Gatton Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gattonstar.com.au","publisher":"APN Holdings NZ Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196290788","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nassau","zipCode":"11565","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Malverne","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"MalverneWestHempsteadLynbrookPatch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"375285518","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"MalverneWestHempsteadLynbrookPatch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://malverne-lynbrook.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695196293679","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:53:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22877259/20170128/091105/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1485654598-9499.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US.

Syd Wagonmaker had a big game, hitting four 3-pointers to finish with 20 points, with three other Eagles finishing with seven or more.\n\n\"We finally shot the ball worth a darn,\" TVHS coach Chad Walker said. \"We started to get a flow, and everything was in the offense. We still missed some bunnies, but we started to hit some shots from the outside. It was good ball movement and getting good shots in the rhythm of the offense.\"\n\nWrestling\n\nMattocks Invitational\n\nDENVER \u2014 Thompson Valley placed seven and came away with the team title in the 34-team field at Lincoln on Saturday, scoring 127.5 points.

No team scores were available.\n\nCoach Will Carron said the team looked good on the mat, showing an ability to turn their opponents and get escapes, but getting to those spots was the issue, saying they need to be better on their feet setting up shots and then finishing them. However, Bailey's finish was a strong sign in his eyes.\n\n\"Bailey had a great tournament,\" Carron said. \"His third-place match was great.

Coach Troy Lussenhop hopes the depth of the field will only serve his team well down the stretch.\n\n\"It's a heck of a league. Isaac beat Dean Noble (of Poudre) again, did it in triple overtime and put him on his back for the win,\" Lussenhop said. \"Being top four at that tournament, that's a heck of a confidence booster.

Source: Reuters  \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi delivered the 28th edition of \u2018Mann Ki Baat\u2019 today at 11 AM. This was PM Modi\u2019s first radio broadcast this year. Todays broadcast was specially for the students who are getting ready to appear for their board examinations in the month of March 2017 for which PM Modi he urged all the young children to listen to what he had to say today before the start of the show. \u2018Mann Ki Baat\u2019, a direct radio broadcast since October 3, 2014 that is addressed to the nation every month. \n \nOn Saturday, the Election Commission of India (EC) gave a green signal to PM Modi\u2019s Mann Ki Baat that was scheduled for January 29. The government had approached the Commission seeking clearance for the radio programme as Model Code of Conduct is in force in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur which are going to assembly polls between February 4 and March 8. \n \nPrime Minister Modi began the show by urging people to observe a silence of 2 minutes on morning of 30 Jan to pay respect to martyrs who gave their lives for the nation. He congratulated the families and personnel who won gallantry awards on Republic Day, He said, \u201cI urge youth to research on the martyrs by using internet and spread the word.\u201d He continued by paying condolence to the deceased and also remembers Mahatma Gandhi. He said, \u201cMy condolence to the brave jawans who lost their lives due to avalanche in Jammu and Kashmir. January 30 is the punya-tithi of our respected Bapu.\u201d \n \nYou may also like to watch- \n \nWhile talking about board examinations and the stress which is borne by the students, PM Modi said, \u201cWhy should exam time be a time of stress or sadness? Do not think about exams as pressure; they should be celebrated as festivals. Smile more and score more. During exams there should be an environment of festivity, it will turn P for pressure into P for pleasure. When you are relaxed, the recall value will be more. Relaxation is the best tonic for memory. A happy mind is the secret of a good mark sheet. Exams are not a benchmark of your success in life. If your mission and ambition are in sync, marks will follow. Take small breaks, return to books feeling fresh. Try deep breathing it is very relaxing. P for prepare and P for play, the person who plays, shines. Deep breathing is beneficial during exams, it\u2019ll keep you feeling fresh; Proper sleep will increase your concentration.\u201d \n \nHe gave the example of former President APJ Abdul Kalam and said, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t able to get into the forces but this did not hamper him, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have had a great man like him.\u201d While asking the students not to compete with others but to our own selves, he said, \u201cYou should compete with yourself to see how can tomorrow be made better than yesterday. Only studying for marks will lead to shortcuts and one will limit himself or herself; It\u2019s important to study for knowledge.\u201d To make this more understandable he gave the example of cricket ledgend Sachin Tendulkar , \u201cFor 20 years he kept breaking his own records hence getting better everytime. Root of problems are expectations, it is acceptance that makes things easy. Competing with others can make you unhappy and jealous. Compete with yourself and you will be energised & more determined to excel.\u201d \n \nHe even urged the parents of the students \u201cto accept rather than expect\u201d, he further said, \u201cOur expectations from our children should not get heavy. Parents\u2019 expectations are much heavier than the school bags of students.\u201d Cheating is never beneficial, no one must resort to it. If you do it what will you tell your children?\u201d \n \nPM Modi congratulated the Indian Coast Guards for completing 40 years on Feb 1, 2017. He said, \u201cI thank all jawans and officials for serving the nation. They not only look after coastal vigilance but also coastal cleanliness, as they under took a cleanliness drive last year.

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n \n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n \n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n \nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n \n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n \n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\" \n \n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Simon Cambers"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"MY","country":"Malaysia"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"TheStar.com.my","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657869","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"TheStar.com.my","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thestar.com.my","publisher":"Star Publications (Malaysia) Berhad"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196302427","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:10Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.thestar.com.my/~/media/online/2017/01/29/07/17/20170129t071237z_1_lynxmped0s06f_rtroptp_3_tennisopen.ashx?crop=1&w=0&h=0&"}],"video":[]}}

Every day, he travels four kilometres to fill a 20-litre plastic jerry can at a local desalination station. \n\nGaza has long suffered severe water problems, with its aquifer contaminated by sewage, chemicals and seawater and the territory\u2019s three desalination plants unable to meet demand. To drink, most citizens depend on imported, bottled water. \n\nBut locals and development specialists say the situation is getting beyond dire, with more than 90 per cent of the water in the aquifer unfit for domestic use, according to Rebhy Al-Sheikh, the deputy chairman of the Palestinian Water Authority. \n\n\u201cThe [tap] water is salty, as if it came straight from the sea. We have stopped drinking it,\u201d said Najar, a father of six, while queuing to get water at the desalination station in Khan Younis. \n\nInstead, he and others use the desalinated water to wash and drink, while those that can afford it buy bottled water. The water from the tap, when it flows, is barely usable, they say. \n\n\u201cIt is not even fit for the animals to drink,\u201d said Fathy Mhareb, 60, an unemployed father of eight. \u201cWe buy sweet water and use the salty water to shower.\u201d \n\nContamination \nThe causes of the problem are multiple, but stem largely from the contamination of the aquifer. \n\nGaza\u2019s main water source contains 55 to 60 million cubic metres of water over the course of a year, but demand from Gaza\u2019s two million population exceeds 200 million cubic metres. \n\nThat means the aquifer is over-strained, allowing seawater from the Mediterranean to seep into it, along with sewage and chemical run-off. \n\n\u201cThere is a continuous drop down and invasion of sea water,\u201d said Sheikh, mentioning too the high nitrate content. \n\nIn a study published in 2012, the United Nations said Gaza would become unlivable by 2020 and its aquifer unusable by 2016. Sheikh said that was almost the case \u2013 according to international standards, the aquifer is 96.5 percent unusable. \n\nThe situation isn\u2019t helped by desperate Gazans trying to tap into the underground reserve via homemade wells. Others use home-spun techniques to desalinate water and sell it on the streets, but the water remains contaminated, Sheikh said. \n\nOne solution has been buying more water from Israel, which has vast desalination capacities. But it took the Palestinians 20 years of negotiation \u2013 from 1995 to 2015 \u2013 to secure the purchase of just five million more cubic metres. \n\nThe blockade of Gaza imposed by Israel and Egypt for most of the past decade also makes it difficult to push ahead rapidly with major projects such as new desalination facilities. \n\nA 10-million-euro, EU-funded desalination plant was opened by the European Union and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund last week. Mohanlal Peiris, a water and sanitation specialist with UNICEF, said the facility, which blends water with that from the municipality, would eventually serve 75,000 people. \n\nThe big hope is that a large-scale desalination plant, costing 500 million euros ($535 million), can be built to get ahead of the rising demand. Plans are in the works, but it remains years off. \n\nFor now, two of Gaza\u2019s three desalination facilities are functioning, producing just 8,600 cubic metres of water a day.

Kennedy International Airport in New York after President Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending all immigration from countries with terrorism concerns for 90 days. Photo: Craig Ruttle \n  \nKerry Stokes (left) talking to Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce at the opening of the airline's hangar at Los Angeles airport. Photo: Patrick Hatch \n    exit  \nCompanies are scrambling to cope with the fallout from US President Donald Trump's executive order barring citizens from seven countries entering the US as Australian business leaders call on the Turnbull government to help clarify its impact. \n \nMr Trump's executive order suspending all immigration from countries with terrorism concerns for 90 days has led to chaotic scenes at US airports as airlines move to enforce the ban on travellers. \n \nMr Trump's order bars citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the US even if they hold valid visas or permanent residence permits, a move that has caught many companies off-guard. \n \nThe US technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, has hit back at the order on immigration and some leaders have called it immoral and unAmerican. \n \nGoogle urgently called back employees from overseas and other companies rushed to provide legal advice and assistance. \n \nTravellers received a brief reprieve after two US judges temporarily blocked the administration from enforcing the order that would have required the removal from US airports of refugees, visa holders and legal US residents. \n \nPeter Strong, chief executive of the Council of Small Business Australia, has called on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Human Rights Commission to help clarify the ban on Muslim travellers to the US. \n \n\"At first glance, this will put employers and employees stuck between a rock and a hard place,\" Mr Strong said. \n \n\"Employers are not allowed to ask where their employees are from but, if they are going to the US for business or a conference, they now have to ask, in case that staff member will be banned. \n \n\"At least having the 90 days gives some time reference, but the Australian government and even the American Embassy need to keep the public informed.\" \n \nJames Pearson, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the order and its rapid implementation would cause uncertainty for Australian businesses, particularly those whose staff had dual nationalities and needed to visit the US. \n \n\"These businesses will be working overtime to see how they will be affected by the changes,\" Mr Pearson said. \n \nIn the US, Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings called it \"a sad week\" and added: \"It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.\" \n \nApple chief executive Tim Cook sent a letter to employees saying Mr Trump's order was \"not a policy we support\" and promised to help affected employees. \n \n\"We have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our co-workers and our company,\" Mr Cook added. \n \nElon Musk, the South African-born founder of Tesla and SpaceX who met recently with Mr Trump, said on Twitter: \"The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country's challenges.\" \n \nTelevision magnate and Seven West Media chairman Kerry Stokes, visiting the US, said Australia shouldn't worry too much about Mr Trump because it was on the right side of its trade balance sheet and was too strong to be led into acting against its own interest. \n \n\"I really don't care,\" the West Australian Rich Lister told Fairfax Media in Los Angeles on Saturday before Mr Trump's executive order was announced. \"The more things change they more they stay the same.\" \n \nIn Mr Trump's first week as president he suggested a 20 per cent tariff on all Mexican goods, as well as on goods from some other countries, and threatened to rewrite trade deals. \n \nMr Trump's administration this week also suggested intervening to stop China taking over territory in the South China Sea. \n \n\"I think we've got about a $60 billion credit with America against imports ... so Mr Trump should fall over us to keep us,\" Mr Stokes said. \n \n\"We're pretty strong, we've got a good government and I don't see us getting pulled into anything we don't want to be involved in.\" \n \nMr Stokes was visiting Los Angeles at the start of the annual G'Day USA week, which promoted Australian business, tourism and culture, and was attending the opening of Qantas' $40 million hangar at Los Angeles International Airport. \n \n\"It's great to see Qantas setting the standard because, at the end of the day, our entire future ... is about the importation of capital, goods and tourism,\" Mr Stokes said. \n \nQantas chief executive Alan Joyce echoed Mr Stokes' ease about the Trump administration, saying he doubted the protectionist president would affect the airline's business. \n \n\"We have a long tradition here, we're very comfortable at doing business here, this is a big market for us: none of that's going to change,\" Mr Joyce said. \n \n\"I don't think that's going to change with this administration or any administration.\" \n \nWith Agencies. \n \nThe story Trump travel ban causes business chaos first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald

Further, over 42 licenses are needed to start and operate an organized sector hotel, while the unregulated sector operates without undergoing any such process. \n\n\u201cWe welcome competition in any and every form, but this kind of disparity is unhealthy for the industry. It is almost as if we are doing our businesses with our hands tied,\u201d says Dilip Datwani, President, HRAWI. \u201cDisruptions are healthy, as it allows customers to enjoy best services at the cheapest rates. But the disruptors cannot be allowed to disrupt and proliferate simply on the basis of avoiding regulations and taxes. Today a hotel, let\u2019s say charges INR 1500/- for a room, then it has to pay 10% as luxury tax beside other taxes, but a bungalow listed in Airbnb, for over INR 10,000/- a day, ends up paying nothing. If nothing else, this is a loss of revenue to the exchequer also.\u201d \n\n\u201cClearly the big ticket concerns are the security issues and the loss of revenue to the exchequer. HRAWI recently compiled a document on how other major cities in the world have dealt with this issue. Some of the findings were revealing. After licenses were made mandatory in Germany, 40% of Berlin\u2019s Airbnb listings disappeared. Amsterdam, meanwhile, banned apartments rented out for more than 60 days per year, or to more than four people at a time. It has also allocated $1.1 million to identify apartments that are being offered for short term rentals or don\u2019t have landlords living in them. Barcelona has slapped Airbnb and Homestay $65,000 each for listing apartment without permit,\u201d says Sanjay Sethi, CEO & Managing Director, Chalet Hotels Pvt Ltd (Chalet Hotels owns several Marriott properties in India). \n\n\u201cIn a country like India where tourism is at a nascent stage the unorganized, illicit accommodation could spell doom. The primary problem is that there are no standardisations or categorisations. There have been multiple cases of exaggerated promises, misrepresentations, disagreements and conflicts with guests, hygiene issues and intimidations among others. Because the stays are unregulated, there are no redressal systems in place,\u201d says Datwani. \u201cHotels are required by law to send details of foreign guests to the police station by submission of a C Form. This is a security requirement from the Ministry of Home Affairs. Homestays are not required to be compliant and the industry fears that this will become the de facto accommodation for those foreigners that seek anonymity from the Police,\u201d he adds. \n\nHRAWI also questioned the relevance of subjecting hotels to administrative clearances, liquor permits and other licenses while these unorganized accommodations, providing the very same services are exempted. Homestays, functioning just like hotels do, are prevalent even today in a lot of States of India. \n\n\u201cThe hospitality industry without these illicit accommodations in Maharashtra today, can generate almost INR 600 crores per extra night that a foreign tourist stays back, to the Government as foreign exchange earnings, besides being the highest employment generator. Almost all tourist towns across the world have grown on the back of strong hospitality infrastructure and not unregulated homestays.

Senator Pauline Hanson toasts Donald Trump's election victory with Senator Malcolm Roberts. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \n  \nSteve Dickson announces his defection to One Nation with Pauline Hanson. Photo: Facebook \n    exit  \nAny notion that One Nation, the political machine built by Pauline Hanson two decades ago, was still an outlier in western politics should have now been swept away by Donald Trump's first week in office. \n \nAs Hanson celebrated Australia Day the new president was settling into the Oval Office, battling the media over crowd numbers for his inauguration and signing his first executive orders and memoranda. \n \nIn one he authorised the construction of a wall along the Mexican border. Another, according to a draft text leaked on Wednesday , would entirely suspend refugee admissions to the US for 120 days as measures are reviewed and ban Syrian refugees from entry indefinitely. \n \nIt would also temporarily block entry visas from seven countries \u2013 Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, and Libya \u2013 for 30 days as part of a broader security review, after which permanent visa bans could be enacted for those countries and others. \n \nIn other words Trump is, as he promised during his election campaign, acting to ban citizens from selected majority Muslim countries from entering the US. \n \nThese measures will not only be felt in the nations they are targeted at, suggests a new research paper, but in Australia too, because One Nation has become a local portal for the spread of the ideas of the international far-right. \n \nIn the first of a series of papers to be published by left-leaning think tank The Australia Institute on the return of One Nation, author Philip Dorling, a former Fairfax Media employee, has studied One Nation's rhetoric on Islam and traced the language to a handful of little-known but influential far-right thinkers and writers from US and Europe. \n \nThis week Hanson announced she was appointing Steve Dickson to be One Nation's leader in Queensland This was a substantial coup. Dickson is not only a sitting MP for the Liberal National Party, but a former state minister. He intends to immediately begin introducing One Nation legislation to Queensland Parliament. \n \nSuch is the strength of the resurgent party, which received 20 per cent of the senate vote at some Queensland booths during the federal election, that it could secure balance of power at the coming state election. \n \n\"It is very humbling. I have never been the leader of a political party before \u2026 and I am very excited about it,\" Dickson told media at a press conference with Hanson. \n \nHanson said she would \"drain the Billabong\". \n \nAddressing the issues, he said he wanted to get on with an 80-year-old plan to drought-proof the state known as the Bradfield scheme. \n \nAnd he had this to say about Islam: \"We welcome anybody from all over the world to come to Australia \u2026 If you want to come here and have two or three wives, if you want to treat women like dogs, if you want to mutilate little girls, there are many countries you can do that but none of them are called Australia. \n \n\"We are not going to take a backwards step, this is a positive campaign with positive policies.\" \n \nDickson has fallen into line with the policies of his new party. \n \nIn launching both One Nation's Queensland and Western Australian campaigns, Hanson focussed on a plan to ban the wearing of burqas. \n \n\"We're going to lead the way in Queensland, so no drivers' licenses wearing the burqa or anything like that,\" she told Sky News, though at present Australian law does not permit women to have drivers' licence photographs taken while wearing the burqa. \n \nThe party's website details a slew of policies targeted at Islam or Muslims, ranging from the banning of the construction of new mosques to the video surveillance of existing ones to Trump's own suspension of immigration from Muslim countries. \n \nBut it is the argument made in Hanson's policy statement that Islam is not a religion that Dorling says reveals much about how right-wing ideas are being transferred from the American right to the Australian. \n \n\"Islam sees itself as a theocracy, not a democracy. Islam does not believe in democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press or freedom of assembly,\" reads the policy document in part. \n \n\"It does not separate religion and politics. Many believe that it is solely a religion, but the reality is that it is much more, for it has a political agenda that goes far outside the realm of religion. Islam regulates the Muslim's social and domestic life, their legal system and politics \u2013 their total life. Its religious aspect is fraud; it is rather a totalitarian political system, including legal, economic, social and military components, masquerading as a religion.\" \n \nDorling notes that though the idea that Islam is not a religion might be a \"radically new proposition within Australian public life\", it is an idea with a history among right-wing evangelical Christians in the US, where anti-Islamic sentiment rose after the September 11 attacks. \n \n\"As early as June 2007 the conservative American Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson told his national radio audience that 'we have to recognise that Islam is not a religion. It is a worldwide political movement meant on domination of the world',\" Dorling writes in the Australia Institute paper. \n \n\"In April 2008 he broadcast that 'I want to say it again, and again, and again: Islam is not a religion, it is a political system meant on \u2013 bent on world domination, not a religion. It masquerades as a religion, but the religion covers a worldwide attempt to exercise power and to subjugate the world to their way of thinking'.\" \n \nThis line of reasoning can be found discussed Breitbart , the online news outlet that helped foster the alt-right movement, as the new white nationalist movement in America has been called. Breitbart's former chief executive is Steve Bannon, who now serves as the Trump's senior counsellor, having helped help run his election campaign and write his \"America First\" inauguration speech. \n \nDorling traces the intellectual history of the argument to back further to virulently anti-Islamic scholars and activists. \n \nOne is Iranian-born Canadian ex-Muslim activist Ali Sina, who argues that Islam is not a religion but rather \"an unreformable, violent, militant political cult\". \n \nSina has offered $50,000 to anyone who can disprove his charge that the prophet Muhammad was \"a narcissist, a misogynist, a rapist, a paedophile, a lecher, a torturer, a mass murderer, a cult leader, an assassin, a terrorist, a madman and a looter\". \n \nDorling quotes Sina's website: \"I find the word 'Muslim' very derogatory and insulting. It is synonymous to stupid, barbarian, thug, arrogant, brain dead, zombie, hooligan, goon, shameless, savage and many other ignoble things. I don't know whether this most disgusting word elicits the same meanings in you or not. So when I want to show my despise [sic] of someone I call him 'Muslim'. But because Muslims are stupid, they don't know all these things and they are proud of this name. This is a win/win situation because I insult them and they are happy and thank me for it. Isn't that smart?\" \n \nSina's writing has been quoted by Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders, who travelled to Australia last year to help launch the Australian anti-Islam party Australian Liberty Alliance. \n \nDorling traces similar ideas to Rebecca Bynum, publisher and managing editor of the British far-right New English Review and an otherwise obscure American former professor of engineering, Bill French, who writes under the name Bill Warner . \n \nWarner has published \"statistical analyses\" of the Koran and other Islamic texts to argue that Islam is \"political, not religious. Islam is a political ideology.\" \n \nThe contention that one of the world's three great Abrahamic religions is not in fact a religion serves a specific purpose in the American context. It allows religious critics of Islam, such as the evangelical right, to argue that it should be stripped of constitutional protection extended to religious thought and expression in the US bill of rights. \n \nSimilarly in Australia, he writes: \"One Nation seeks to deny Islam's status as a religion and thus deny Australian Muslims constitutional protection for their human rights of freedom of religion and belief.\" \n \nThe paper notes that when asked how the party established its position that Australia was at risk of being \"swamped by Muslims\", One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts told Channel 10's The Project : \"We've got an adviser who goes into all of that called Frank Salter.\" \n \nSalter is an Australian academic who undertook post-doctoral research at the former Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology in Germany. He contends that discrimination against ethnic minorities is an \"inborn response\" all humans have, Dorling writes. \n \n\"In his view monocultural societies are inherently 'fitter' than multicultural ones, and that ethnic diversity leads to corruption, weak public services and a decline in government institutions. South Africa's former apartheid regime is described as an example of 'aggressive social control' used to preserve the 'fitness' of society.\" \n \nBoth Salter and Hanson declined to be interviewed for this story. \n \nSpeaking with Fairfax Media, Dorling said the political purpose of One Nation's adoption of its stance on Islam was simple. Hanson, he said, launched her career by attacking Asians and Indigenous Australians. She is renewing her support by harnessing an international fear of terrorism linked to Islamic extremists. \n \nBut, says Dorling, the significance of the development is broader. \n \nHe notes that when One Nation first arose in Australia, Parliament House was not linked to the internet, Hanson had no political experience or brand and her ideas were not buoyed by an international movement. \n \nAll of that has changed, says Dorling, and today's One Nation is now an effective Australian portal to the ideas of a far-right that is surging in Europe and North America. \n \n\"The Trump administration is going to present [One Nation] with a slew of ideas, and the justification of applying the ideas and policies of the emerging Australian alt-right.\" \n \nThe story One Nation, Australia's portal to Trump and the alt-right first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"lnw.admin"},"topics":[],"title":"One Nation, Australia's p...","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Northern Africa","countryCode":"LY","country":"Libya"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Libyan Newswire","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608217373","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Libyan Newswire","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://libyannewswire.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/trump-muslim-immigration-order/514460/","http://www.smh.com.au/queensland/pauline-hanson-pledges-to-drain-the-billabong-20170123-gtxfaa.html","https://www.politicalislam.com/author/","http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/one-nation-australias-portal-to-trump-and-the-altright-20170127-gu08q5.html","http://www.smh.com.au/"],"sequenceId":"695196308415","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

According to several reports, green card holders -- legal permanent residents of the US -- were also among those who have been prevented from getting on flights. This is while, green cards are not specifically mentioned in the executive order. \n \nThus, the National Iranian American Council (NIAC) called on Iranian green-card holders \"not [to] leave the US until further clarity is achieved.\" \n \nSeveral Iraqi passengers and a Yemeni national, who had valid visas for the US, were blocked from boarding a flight at Egypt's Cairo airport bound for New York on Saturday, The Guardian cited airport officials. \n \nAt least two Iraqis were detained after flying in to New York's JFK airport on Friday night. Their lawyers filed a lawsuit against the measure on Saturday, demanding their clients be released, The New York Times reported. \n \nOne of the Iraqis, named as Hameed Khalid Darweesh, is said to have worked on behalf of the US government in Iraq for 10 years and the second detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was reportedly traveling to New York to join his wife and young son. \n \nMeanwhile; Google recalled its traveling employees, who may be affected by the order, to return to the US immediately. The tech company's Chief executive officer Sundar Pichai expressed concern about the new order, saying even though they have valid visas, they would be blocked from returning to the US. \n \nHe denounced Trump's order, saying \"It's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,\" Bloomberg reported. According to him, 100 of Google employees were affected by the order. \n \nFacebook's Mark Zuckerberg also slammed Trump and condemned his bans on refugees. \"The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that.\" \n \nTrump, however, has given Homeland Security 60 days to begin providing him with the names of other countries to add to the list. \n   \nNEWS LETTER \n  Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"lnw.admin"},"topics":[],"title":"Visa holders barred from entering US as Trump's order takes effect","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Northern Africa","countryCode":"LY","country":"Libya"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Libyan Newswire","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608217373","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Libyan Newswire","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://libyannewswire.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196309899","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Spread over 3000 sq. ft. area, the store also boasts of an exclusive QUEO Luxury bathroom zone dedicated to showcase the fashion lines by renowned designers like Antonio Bullo, Romano Adolini, FedricoTombolini, Chiara Valeri and Antonio Cristofaro. \n\nSpeaking at the inauguration, Somany said, \u201cWe are delighted to achieve yet another milestone in our growth story with the inauguration of this store in Hyderabad. We have now moved even closer to delight our discerning customers with aspirational products. The store employs hand-picked bathroom experts who are well-trained and dedicated to ensure the customers have a smooth buying and after-sales experience.\u201d \n\nBhatia added, \u201cThe Indian luxury landscape is experiencing an evolution which is redefining the consumer profile. Luxury in India is no longer the privilege of a few born into wealth. There is now a larger consumer base which has the money to splurge but wants a real value proposition. Also, this consumer base is not restricted to the top metro cities anymore. More than 40% of the total luxury market revenue is generated from smaller cities and towns. This luxury consumption in Tier II and III cities is growing steadily due to high internet penetration, increasing awareness amongst the youth and higher disposable income of the working segment.\u201d \n\nHe further said, \u201cOur main focus is to align HSIL\u2019s presence across these strategic locations in order to generate strong brand distinction. We feel that it is essential for us to grow by increasing our consumer touch points and provide them with holistic bathroom solutions.

The ban does not apply to non-Muslims from those countries. \n \nTrump said on January 28 that his executive order was not a ban against Muslims, and that provisions to limit the influx of refugees to the United States were \"working out very nicely.\" \n \nHe also said that the United States should impose the \"extreme vetting\" process for many years. \n \nA U.S. Homeland Security spokesman said on January 28 that the temporary ban applied to citizens of the seven targeted countries even if they are U.S. green-card holders -- that is, Muslims working toward becoming naturalized U.S. citizens who effectively hold permanent U.S. residency papers. \n \nLater on January 28, a senior U.S. administration official said green-card holders from the seven targeted countries must be cleared to enter the United States on a case-by-case basis. \n \nThe order had immediate impact on civilian passenger flights to the United States, with the Dutch airline KLM announcing that it refused to allow onto its flights to the United States seven passengers who were from the targeted countries. \n \nAli Abdi, an Iranian citizen with permanent residency in the United States, told Britain's The Guardian newspaper that Trump's executive order had left him stuck in limbo in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \n \nAbdi, a doctoral student of anthropology in the United States, said he left New York on January 22 to carry out ethnographic research in Afghanistan. \n \nBut he said Trump's order left it unclear whether the Afghan Consulate in Dubai will issue the entry visa he needs to do his field work there. \n \nHe said he couldn't go to Iran because he has been outspoken about Tehran's human rights violations, he can't return to the United States, and he cannot stay longer in Dubai because his visa there will soon run out. \n \nTrump also decreed a four-month suspension of the U.S. refugee program for countries other than Syria -- an order affecting refugees from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. And he cut in half to 50,000 the number of refugees the United States will accept from around the world during 2017. \n \nA major exception to the refugee bans was for Syrian Christians, who Trump said were persecuted in their homeland. \n \n\"I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Don't want them here,\" Trump said as he unveiled the orders at the Pentagon. \n \n\"We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.\" \n \nCivil rights groups condemned the measures as discriminatory and unconstitutional for targeting a specific religion. \n \nThey said the moves, which Trump had promised during his campaign, would strand refugees in dangerous places and backfire by feeding hatred toward the United States in the Muslim world and tarnishing its reputation as a land welcoming of immigrants and the world's \"poor and huddled masses.\" \n \n\"'Extreme vetting' is just a euphemism for discriminating against Muslims,\" said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. \n \nAhmed Rehab of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said his group would fight the orders \"tooth and nail\" in court. \n \n\"It is targeting people based on their faith and national origin, and not on their character or their criminality,\" he told AFP. \n \nImmigration attorneys said the orders were having an immediate chaotic impact on people planning to visit the United States or arranging for relatives in one of the targeted countries to join them in America. \n \nDemocrats condemned the move as un-American, saying it would damage the reputation of the United States. \n \n\"Today's executive order from President Trump is more about extreme xenophobia than extreme vetting,\" Democratic Senator Edward Markey said in a statement. \n \nSome Republicans praised the decision, including Representative Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House of Representatives' Judiciary Committee, who said the extremist group Islamic State had threatened to use the U.S. immigration system. \n \n\"I am pleased that President Trump is using the tools granted to him by Congress and the power granted by the constitution to help keep America safe and ensure we know who is entering the United States,\" Goodlatte said in a statement. \n \nEven before Trump's announcement, prominent people from the targeted regions said they would boycott travel to the United States in protest. An Iranian actress in a film nominated for an Academy Award this year said she would boycott the Los Angeles awards ceremony. \n \nAn Iraqi-Kurdish filmmaker, Hussein Hassan, also scrapped plans to attend the U.S. premiere of his critically acclaimed film on Iraq's embattled Yazidi minority, The Dark Wind, scheduled for March. \n \nJames Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, told AP that the orders are \"wrongheaded and dangerous in terms of the Middle East.\" \n \nIranian-Americans point out that not a single terrorist incident in the United States has involved Iranians, while many of the hijackers involved in the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington were from Saudi Arabia, which is not on the list of targeted countries. \n \nMoreover, Iran, like the United States and Iraq, has sent troops to battle Islamic State (IS) militants in Iraq and Syria, the group that has inspired the most recent attacks by its followers in the United States. \n \nIn Tehran, the government said it would respond to Trump's order by issuing a similar ban that prevents U.S. citizens from entering Iran. \n \nFrance, Germany, and other U.S. allies also expressed concern about Trump's decision to limit immigration and refugees from some Muslim countries. \n \nFrench President Francois Hollande said on January 28 that Trump's administration was encouraging \"populism and even extremism.\" \n \nHollande told other Southern European leaders who were meeting in Lisbon that they must \"stand together in Europe\" to face an increasingly uncertain world, saying that \"what is at stake is populism\" and that \"the kind of discourse now coming from the United States encourages populism and even extremism.\" \n \nIn Ankara, Turkey's Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the refugee crisis was a \"global issue\" and that all countries must do their part to solve the problem. \n \nAbbas al-Bayati, an Iraqi member of parliament, said the curbs were sending the wrong message to Iraqis at a time when Washington is counting on Iraqi forces to battle IS militants in their stronghold of Mosul. \n \nFellow Iraqi lawmaker Majid Chenkali was less diplomatic, saying Iraq should respond in kind and not allow Americans into Iraq. \n \n\"It should be an eye for an eye,\" he told AP. \n \nWith reporting by AP, AFP, Reuters, and The Guardian \n \nSource: http://www.rferl.org/a/28264371.html \n \nCopyright (c) 2017.

Trump and his team insisted the order was not intended to target Islam and its followers, but the hashtag #muslimban trended, and many Muslims both in America and abroad said they viewed the measure as a broadly conceived and stinging exclusion. \n\nCapping a day of high-stakes drama, a federal judge in New York, Ann M. Donnelly, ordered a halt to deportations of travelers who arrived at airports with valid visas to enter the U.S., saying that sending them back to the affected countries could cause them \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d But she did not rule on the legality of the executive order, nor did she say that others who have not yet arrived in the U.S. can be allowed to proceed. \n\nOpponents of the president\u2019s directive vowed to seek a wider court win. Lawyers from groups including the American Civil Liberties Union said they intended to press ahead with efforts to overturn the president\u2019s overall order on constitutional grounds. And they rejoiced at their early victory. \n\n\u201cClearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country,\u201d said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero. \u201cOn week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n\nIn a separate and more limited ruling, a federal judge in Virginia ordered a weeklong stay against removing people with permanent U.S. residency who had been detained under the presidential order at Washington Dulles International Airport. \n\nAs the directive\u2019s effects spread, thousands staged spontaneous protests against refugee detention at airports across the country, including in Los Angeles and San Francisco. At New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, demonstrators waved signs and read from the famous Emma Lazarus poem inscribed in the Statue of Liberty. \n\nAt more than a dozen airports, including Los Angeles, Newark, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and Atlanta, immigration attorneys stepped up in droves to offer free services to those detained. \u201cA lot of tears and emotion here,\u201d said Hassan Ahmad, a lawyer from northern Virginia who hustled to Dulles airport. \n\nThe New York order appeared to affect the 100 to 200 people who were detained in transit to the United States. While the order will prevent them from being sent home, it was less clear whether they will have to remain in detention while their asylum cases are being decided. \n\nOne of the two detained Iraqis named in the case, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was an interpreter who had worked on behalf of the U.S. government. Freed after 19 hours in custody, he wept as he spoke to reporters, thanking supporters and calling America \u201cthe land of freedom, the land of rights.\u201d \n\nThe groups bringing the legal challenge, who also included the International Refugee Assistance Project and the National Immigration Law Center, said a separate motion sets the stage for a larger action involving other would-be refugees, visitors and immigrants stopped at other ports of entry. \n\nArab American advocacy groups also were reacting to the new order, warning that it was disrupting travel all over the world. \n\n\u201cWe see complete chaos in the way this has been implemented,\u201d Abed A. Ayoub, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said in a conference call with reporters. \n\nThe directive, he said, had caught up not only desperate refugees who had thought themselves within a hairsbreadth of safety, but many more with already established lives, homes and families in the United States. \u201cThis order needs to be rescinded,\u201d he said. \n\nIn another legal challenge, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would file a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. The suit, to be filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Virginia, argues that the executive order is unconstitutional because of its apparent aim of singling out Muslims. \n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that refugees \u2014 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2014 are a threat to national security,\u201d the group\u2019s national litigation director, Lena F. Masri, said in a statement. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d \n\nThe order, signed Friday by Trump during a visit to the Pentagon, suspends all refugee entries for 120 days. In addition, it indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees and bars entry to the U.S. for 90 days for those traveling from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n\nProminent Muslim figures raised their voices in opposition to the temporary refugee ban, saying children would be among those suffering the most from it. \n\nNobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by the Taliban, said in a statement that she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d that Trump was closing the door on \u201cchildren, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war.\u201d \n\nOn Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said the travel ban also covered holders of green cards, who are authorized to live and work in the U.S. Some reports have put the number of such permanent residents from the affected countries as high as half a million. \n\nAn administration official said that current green card holders from the affected countries would be allowed to remain in the U.S. \u2014 but that those caught outside the country at the time of the ban\u2019s imposition would have to be allowed back in on a case-by-case basis.

She opened up to Matthew Xuereb . \n \nA learning support assistant from Qala has lived through a \u201cliving nightmare\u201d fending off sexual abuse allegations, which five years on have finally been laid to rest after her acquittal in court last week. \n \nKaren Mercieca, 38, was cleared of having defiled an 11-year-old girl with a learning disability at the Għajnsielem Primary School in November 2011. Her acquittal in 2015 was confirmed on appeal last week. \n \nYesterday, Ms Mercieca told The Sunday Times of Malta in an emotional interview that she had spent five years \u201cexisting rather than living\u201d. \n \n\u201cIt has been a living nightmare, having to wake up every morning with such an accusation. I have tried not to let it affect me, but the burden was too heavy to carry year after year. \n \n\u201cDuring these five years, I stopped living and was just existing. The life I had enjoyed so much made no sense anymore. Having to prove my innocence for such an accusation took away my life,\u201d she said. \n Karen Mercieca, 38, an LSA whose life has been turned upside down over the past five years.  \nThroughout the five years, she kept asking herself over and over again why someone would make such an accusation against her. \n \n\u201cThere is no rational reason, except that there are evil people who thrive on other people\u2019s pain and injustice.\u201d \n \nShe had been an LSA for 11 years when, all of a sudden, her professional and personal life came crumbling down. She was called in by the police, who were looking into a claim, made by the mother and aunt of one of her students, that she had touched the child inappropriately. The student was in Year 6. \n \nIt all started on November 8, 2011, when, she said, she saw a wound that looked like a burn on the student\u2019s left arm, close to her elbow. \n \n\u201cI had already noticed that it looked like a cigarette burn. I asked her about it, and she told me that it was a burn. I informed the Head of School about it. From then on, my life turned upside down. \n \n\u201cOn November 14, my hell began when I received a telephone call from the police station asking me to go, as they wanted to speak to me. Between the 8th and the 14th, when I was eventually interrogated and arrested, the student was still assigned to me like the previous two years, and her behaviour was normal,\u201d she explained. \n \nMs Mercieca is still bitter and very hurt about the entire case and did not mince her words in accusing the prosecution of being unprofessional. \n \n\u201cThe fact that I am and was always innocent, as was confirmed twice by the Maltese justice system, is enough to prove that no professional investigation was done,\u201d she said. \n \nShe claimed the investigating officers did not visit the school where the alleged sexual abuse took place, nor did they speak to anyone who could have witnessed it. \n \n\u201cDuring my interrogation, I was made aware that it was being alleged that the incident took place during one of the short breaks when the student was kept in to redo homework she had done carelessly. I informed the police immediately that I was not alone with the student during the break and that there were other students in class with me for the entire break. \n \n\u201cBut the investigation was not taken seriously, as the inspector did not even go to the classroom to speak with the students in class,\u201d she alleged angrily. \n  The fact that I am and was always innocent, as was confirmed twice by the Maltese justice system, is enough to prove that no professional investigation was done   \nIn his judgment of 2015, Magistrate Joseph Mifsud said there were many questions that remained unanswered. He highlighted the fact that the child\u2019s burn was not investigated by the police. Was it a cigarette burn, an oven burn or a mosquito sting as the girl claimed, the court asked. \n \nMagistrate Mifsud said the girl took 20 minutes to explain where the burn came from and was uncomfortable with the questions about it. \n \nThe magistrate and Chief Justice Silvio Camilleri, who presided over the appeal, both based their decision on the convoluted versions of events given by the girl, who changed her story throughout her testimony. She even mixed up what she had been wearing, mentioning a dress, a skirt and trousers. \n \nMs Mercieca had harsh words for the lengthy proceedings, when a different magistrate was presiding over the case before it got assigned to Magistrate Mifsud in June 2015. She said it took three years before she could testify in court and there were many sittings when she would turn up at the courthouse \u201cfor nothing\u201d. \n \n\u201cIn my opinion, the case dragged on for way too long. The last year was especially hard on me, as I had to wait for my appeal decision. Having to wait to appear in court several times for nothing took its toll on my physical and psychological well-being. \n \n\u201cEventually though, justice was done and the truth emerged,\u201d she said. \n \nMs Mercieca said she had \u201cno doubt\u201d that there had been a drastic decline in people taking up her profession. \n \n\u201cI cannot say that I blame them, when professionals are treated as criminals. It is important to note, though, that from my case onwards, there have been changes made to the way investigations take place, as they should be.\u201d \n \nAs of yesterday, Ms Mercieca was still suspended from working as an LSA, although in the meantime she has been carrying out secretarial duties in a government department. \n \nBut she is now looking forward to returning to the classroom. \u201cI was prevented from exercising my profession, which I have dedicated my life to. \n \n\u201cI always did my best to help students, and I intend to keep doing so. It is not fair to let a false accusation limit me from carrying out my duties.\u201d \n \nAsked what message she wanted to get across as  a result of what she had been through, Ms Mercieca said: \u201c[I would like] all professionals to be vigilant and never work with children on a one-to-one basis. The risk is too great. I do not want anyone to go through what I did. \n \n\u201cPolice investigations are to be carried out well, all abuses should be reported and investigated, but it is important that these investigations are carried out by people who know what they are doing, as the repercussions are so great for all involved.\u201d \n \nMs Mercieca thanked all those who supported her from the outset and those \u201cfrom all walks of life\u201d who \u201cnever doubted my integrity, professionalism, dedication and, above all, my innocence\u201d. \n \n\u201cUnfortunately my health has suffered the brunt of this ordeal. The trauma I went through left me suffering from severe anxiety. I am aware that it is going to be a long journey for me to recover from such a horrible experience that could have been totally avoided had the investigation been carried out professionally. \n \n\u201cI regret that this ordeal has not just affected me alone, but unfortunately my family went through hell with me all the way, and this made the experience I went through even harder,\u201d she said as she thanked the President of the Malta Union of Teachers, Kevin Bonello, her lawyers Stephen Tonna Lowell and Giannella de Marco, as well as her colleagues at the Għansielem Primary and the office of the Care for the Elderly.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matthew Xuereb"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Malta news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Teacher\u2019s \u2018living nightmare\u2019 after charges of sexual abuse","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe","countryCode":"MT","country":"Malta"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Times of Malta","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660702","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"87"},"name":"Times of Malta","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.timesofmalta.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196329155","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

You don\u2019t.\u201d \n \nIn conference games, UTRGV ranks last in the WAC at 34.3 percent shooting as a team. \n \nGoff leads UTRGV in scoring on the season at 15.2 points per game and got off to a hot start Saturday, scoring 10 in the opening quarter. \n \nShe credited inspiration for her big night to her struggles shooting the last time out: a 10-point performance making 4 of 20 attempts against Utah Valley. \n \n\u201cI look at those things and I say, \u2018Man, I\u2019m playing like poo,\u2019\u201d Goff said. \u201cI just got out here earlier and got shots up, and I got up early before the game and got up shots, and I was able to do that. \u2026 With any good player, if you let them get hot the first couple minutes, it\u2019s going to be a long game.\u201d \n \nThe loss drops UTRGV to 14-9 overall and 4-3 in the WAC, ranking fifth. The Vaqueros are also facing the prospect of moving ahead without forwards Mary Savoy and Lile Havili, who were suspended indefinitely before Thursday\u2019s win against Utah Valley. \n \nThe Vaqueros entered the year with conference championship aspirations, having reached the WAC Tournament title game each of the past two seasons.

We\u2019ve got to do a better job of defending the half court.\u201d \n \nNick Dixon, coming off a 41-point effort in a 92-81 loss to Utah Valley on Thursday, led the Vaqueros with 26 points, including 12 of 12 from the free-throw line. Green added 22 points. \n \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t fatigue. You\u2019ve got to give Seattle credit,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cThey executed at the end. It was just a battle of wills, and they came out tonight. \n \nMoore led the Redhawks with a career-high 33 points, well above his previous best of 17. Brendan Westendorf added 29 points and William Powell had 22. \n \n\u201cWe guarded him in the second half,\u201d Hill said of Moore. \u201cThen you don\u2019t get wide-open 3s. That\u2019s what he does. He shoots.\u201d \n \nThe Redhawks torched the Vaqueros from beyond the arc in the first half, hitting 13-of-20 3s en route to a 53-40 lead at the break. \n \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t follow the game plan,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t stay attached to the shooters like we were told to. We knew exactly what they were capable of and what we were supposed to do. We just didn\u2019t do it the first half. We did it in the second half.\u201d \n \nMoore, shooting 34 percent from long range this season, had 21 first-half points, connecting on 7 of 8 3-point attempts \u2014 two more than his previous career high of five made. \n \nWestendorf, a senior guard, made 5 of 7 3-point attempts, adding 17 first-half points. \n \n\u201cWe were completely aware how Seattle plays. They like to shoot a lot of 3s,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cIt was just a lack of focus. We just over-helped them. We over-exaggerated with the penetration, and they were just baiting us the whole time, penetrate and then kick it. It just took us too long to figure it out.\u201d \n \nThe Vaqueros also were dialed in early from outside, with four early baskets from beyond the arc, pulling within 18-16 on Green\u2019s 3 with 13:11 left in the half. \n \nXavier McDaniel Jr. was fouled on a 3-point attempt and hit all three free throws to pull UTRGV within 31-26. The Redhawks responded with a 16-5 run, including four 3-pointers, pushing the lead 47-31 on two free throws by Powell with 3:03 remaining in the half. \n \n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t stick to the game plan,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe stuck to it probably 18 minutes in the second half. We just didn\u2019t do it when it mattered most at the end of the game, and that\u2019s why they separated.\u201d \n \nWith the loss, the Vaqueros fell to 1-11 on the road. They\u2019re 7-3 at home and 2-0 at neutral sites. \n \n\u201cHomecourt advantage, I always try to underplay it,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cBut, after being on the road, experiencing it in college, and the travel, it does take effect on you.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JIM HOEHN"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Second-half rally falls short for UTRGV men's basketball vs. Seattle","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hidalgo","zipCode":"78501","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Mcallen","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"McAllen Monitor","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169671782","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"460"},"name":"McAllen Monitor","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.themonitor.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196329601","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/themonitor.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/98/9987938c-7a9e-11e5-94c2-3753f77aadb7/562c063467d66.image.png?resize=300%2C246"}],"video":[]}}

Wildlife lovers and experts say that while poisoning, shooting, foot-traps (snares) and even explosive-traps are among some of the popular poaching methods in Indian forests, electrocution is rising because it mostly goes undetected and animals mostly die quickly.\n\n\"In last three years, this trend has increased... the incidents point towards a specialised poaching... maximum cases go undetected,\" Shekhar Niraj, Head of TRAFFIC, a wildlife trade monitoring network in alliance with the WWF, told IANS.\n\nAccording to experts, while shooting is risky and poisoning often harms cattle, leading to an uproar from the villagers, electrocution is a silent way that mostly goes undetected.\n\n\"Only strong intelligence and active surveillance can stop the rising incidents of electrocution,\" Niraj added.\n\nAmong some of the most recent incidents, at least two elephants, one tigress, two leopards, two sambar deer and one sloth bear were killed due to electrocution in different regions of the country. The reasons were both poaching and accidental.\n\nOn Friday, January 27, a 20-year-old elephant died after coming into contact with an illegal electric fence around a field near Karnataka's Bandipur National Park. On January 25, a female elephant was killed due to electrocution in the forests of Odisha's Rourkela district.\n\n\"The elephant climbed a small Bandha to reach out to the leaves, and touched the loosely hanging wire. We had informed the electricity department. Wires often hang loose due to the long distance between the electric poles in forests,\" Rourkela District Forest Officer Sanjeet Kumar told IANS on telephone.\n\nElectrocution is a method in which a wired trap or fence, mostly powered by a high tension electric line passing nearby in the forests, is used to kill the animals, either for poaching or to protect fields from herbivores. The wires with electric current are either placed on the preferred routes of the animals or passed through the water bodies used by animals.\n\nWildlife experts say instances of electrocution are on the rise and despite the 2005 guidelines of the Supreme Court's Central Empowered Committee (CEC) to the State Electricity Boards and Forest Departments to strengthened security to prevent poaching by electrocution, nothing much was done.\n\nAccording to Tito Joseph of the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), while every year at least 20 elephants die due to electrocution, at least 43 elephants were killed in 2016 in this manner.\n\n\"In 2011, at least 11 leopards died due to electrocution and at least 10 wild tigers were poached,\" Joseph told IANS.\n\nTwo leopards, one tigress and two sambar deer were also electrocuted between January 11 and 14 in different forest divisions of Maharashtra's Nagpur district.\n\nOn January 25, a sloth bear was found electrocuted with its claws harvested, in Amravati Forest Division of Maharashtra, an official told IANS.\n\n(Kushagra Dixit can be reached at kushagra.d@ians.in)\n\n--IANS\n\nkd/vm/tb/sac \n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Nature news","group":"Science"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Electrocution of wild animals increasing, experts raise concerns","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNOi"],"sequenceId":"695196329959","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Tennis - Australian Open - Melbourne Park, Melbourne, Australia By Simon cambers\n\nMELBOURNE, (Reuters) - Serena Williams plans to play fewer tournaments in the future to aid her quest to win more grand slam titles, according to her coach Patrick Mouratoglou.\n\nThe 35-year-old American won her 23rd grand slam title on Saturday at the Australian Open, breaking the open-era record she held jointly with Germany\u2019s Steffi Graf.\n\nSerena will now manage her schedule as she chases down the all-time leader Margaret Court, the Australian whose record of 24 grand slam titles straddled the amateur and professional eras.\n\n\"Mentally she has to stay fresh and mentally excited when the grand slams start, because they are the goal,\" Mouratoglou told a group of reporters after Serena\u2019s 6-4, 6-4 victory over her sister Venus Williams gave her a seventh Australian Open title.\n\n\"So we have a lighter schedule \u2013 not lighter than last year, which would be difficult (when she played just eight events and did not play after September) - but lighter than the year before (11 events).\"\n\nAt one stage in 2016, Serena held the world number one ranking based only on seven events over a 52-week period.\n\nGermany\u2019s Angelique Kerber overtook her when she won the U.S. Open last September but Serena will return to top spot when the rankings are updated on Monday.\n\nSerena has traditionally played fewer tournaments than most top players, but since she usually reaches the final, she is able to pick and choose.\n\nFrom the start of 2012 to the end of 2016, Serena won 288 matches, second only to Poland's Agnieska Radwanska, who won 289.\n\nBut while Radwanska lost 107 matches in that period, Serena lost just 29.\n\nMouratoglou said Indian Wells, in March, would be Serena's next stop but didn't expect to see her at too many events before the next grand slam, the French Open, which begins on May 29. \"We've already done the schedule for the whole year,\" Mouratoglou said. \"It doesn\u2019t mean that the schedule is not going to change, it's meant to adapt to situations. But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\"\n\nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour.\n\n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n\n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\"\n\nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court.\n\n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"CY","country":"Cyprus"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Investing.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"362107434","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"236"},"name":"Investing.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://de.investing.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196330196","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:20:36Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://ca33f332e2199349c49c-dc74b5af55c9b2a1bd8891aa9e8701fc.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/trkd-images/LYNXMPED0S06H_L.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

However, they are y to share food with other animals during complex situations, a new study found.\n\nThe study found that dogs exhibit pro-social behaviour and they clearly showed a preference for sharing the food reward with another familiar dog, whereas unfamiliar dogs were rewarded nearly three times less often than the familiar ones. The higher level of complexity, however, impacted the general frequency of the food delivery, Rachel Dale from the University of Veterinary Medicine - Vienna in Austria, said in a statement.\n\nIn addition, the presence of a partner was found to make dogs more likely to share their food.\n\nIn the study, the researchers tested whether it made a difference to the donor dog if the receiver was familiar or a stranger.\n\nWhen a second dog was present in the testing room without being in the other enclosure, the donor dogs were more motivated to give a food reward. When the test dogs were alone in the room, the number of food deliveries went down, the researchers mentioned.\n\nThis aspect, known as social facilitation, starts from the assumption that animals will perform more readily in the presence of conspecifics.\n\nThe presence of a partner appears to play a greater role. In this case too, the donor dogs preferred familiar partners, the researchers said.\n\n\"The difference was smaller, however, than when there was direct visual contact.

The Aussies think it's great because it's a win win for them.\" \n \nCahill said there was little compassion in the Australian policy, which sent back everyone no matter what their offence. \n \n\"It might be one thing when you've got someone that has committed an armed robbery sitting in jail. It's different when you've got someone who has lived their whole life there and been convicted of a relatively minor offence.\" \n \nTony Touri, 48, landed in Christchurch before Christmas, after stints in jail and an Australian immigration detention centre. \n \nHe left behind his family, a $2000-a-week job and the kickboxing club where he helped train youth. \n \nTouri saw Christchurch as a fresh start with labouring opportunities and a place free from old North Island gang connections. \n \n\"It turned my life upside down. When I arrived here, I felt like an alien.\" \n \nCahill said it had been well proven through released prisoners, that if supports were not in place, the risk of reoffending was greater. \n \n\"These people are sort of similar but there isn't the same support available to follow up with them all the time, so it doesn't surprise me we're getting that 30 per cent reoffending,\" he said. \n \nThe Canterbury branch of Pars has found growing demand for their support service. \n \n\"We could have one in a month. We could get roughly one a week, then two in one week,\" Murphy said. \n \nIn 2014, Pars settled just three people in Christchurch. That figure rose to 15 in 2015 and to 51 in 2016. \n \nFive women were among the group that had arrived since 2014. \n \nCounties Manukau District has the highest population of deportees, with 118 residing in the area.  \n \nAuckland City has attracted 89, while 69 people are listed in Canterbury.  \n \nWellington has 52 returning offenders and 51 are in the Waitemata District. \n \nCorrections deputy national commissioner Rachel Leota\u200b said the provision of effective reintegration services for returning offenders was important because many did not have strong links to New Zealand.  \n \nCorrections budgeted $300,000 a year for five years for providers such as Pars to help returning offenders settle back into life in New Zealand.  \n \nPrior to entering a contract with the Corrections in 2016, Pars received $77,000 from the Christchurch City Council to support deportees. \n \nCahill said before an information sharing agreement with Australian authorities was signed in September 2015, police were lucky to get a few hours notice of new arrivals.  \n \n\"Whereas now we are able to prepare a little and have staff meet them.\" \n \nHigh-risk offenders are visited by police 48 hours after arrival. \n \n\"It's good in theory but there simply aren't the resources to do that. And there are no controls,\" Cahill said. \n \nHe said in some cases in Auckland, returning offenders had checked out of supported living arrangements or motels before police arrived for their checkup.  \n \n\"They're not breaking the law per se when they do that, because a lot of them aren't under any restrictions. They're just into the wind.\" \n \n  \n      Comments","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"EMILY SPINK"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Dozens of Australian deportees are being sent to NZ on a weekly basis","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Nelson Mail","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169744542","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Nelson Mail","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196331679","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:07:10Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

John Cornyn is continuing his push for Mars exploration \u2014 a visionary effort. \n \nCornyn and Rep. John Culberson , R-Houston, have introduced legislation that would make a manned mission to Mars NASA\u2019s long-term priority. Cornyn first rolled out the bill in March, following Commander Scott Kelly \u2019s safe return to Earth after a year in space. \n \nCornyn\u2019s legislation, \u201cMapping a New and Innovative Focus on our Exploration Strategy,\u201d would create a framework to expand our space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit. It would require regular updates about NASA\u2019s exploration strategy, require a partnership with the National Academy of Sciences , and set a manned-mission to Mars as the agency\u2019s priority. This strategy to get humans to Mars would be updated every five years. \n \nCornyn\u2019s legislation is based on a thoughtful 2014 report from the National Academies on the future of space flight. A manned mission to Mars would be expensive and dangerous. It would almost certainly entail a much-needed return to the moon. But it represents aspirational qualities that have made this nation great: to explore and seek new horizons and to better understand our universe. \n \nInvesting in space exploration also undoubtedly would spur technical and scientific advancement, leading to new technologies. It would require international partnerships and investment, serving as a soft diplomacy while also highlighting our ingenuity. It would bring focus to NASA, curbing missions that don\u2019t serve the long-range goal of human spaceflight to Mars. \n \nWe are stuck in low-Earth orbit. Budgets that only keep pace with inflation will not get us to Mars or what lies beyond. Space flight is a symbol of our ability to achieve the unfathomable. Cornyn\u2019s legislation is a reminder not to lose sight of that.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Express-News Editorial Board"},"topics":[{"name":"Space science news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"For NASA, the goal should be Mars","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bexar","zipCode":"78205","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"San Antonio","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"MySanAntonio","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169687373","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"MySanAntonio","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mysanantonio.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196350801","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

T.J. Shope has introduced a bill complementing the Pinal Regional Transportation Authority plan. \n \nHowever, the bill\u2019s opponents stand their ground, alleging misuse of funds under the current transportation half-cent tax rate. \n \nShope, R-Coolidge, said he\u2019s backing House Bill 2156, relating to the county transportation excise tax, at the request of the county government, including the Board of Supervisors, and the Pinal Partnership organization with what they\u2019ve been working on for the RTA plan. \n \n\u201cBeing the good representative that I am, I said, \u2018sure, I\u2019ll introduce (the bill) for you,\u2019\u201d Shope said. \n \nThe Pinal RTA has a plan consisting of road and public transportation projects anticipated to be developed between 2017 and 2036. If approved by voters, the plan and half-cent excise tax would set aside about $640 million in transportation funding over a 20-year timespan to establish and enhance the transportation network in Pinal County. \n \nShope\u2019s bill would mean a levy, if enacted in a countywide election, for the regional transportation authority in any county and collection of a transportation excise tax up to the rate specified in the bill in addition to existing taxes. \n \nThe tax would be levied beginning either Jan. 1 or July 1, depending on which comes first after voters approve the measure. It would remain in effect for 20 years. \n \nShope said the bill would mean flexibility to counties setting different rates at different dollar thresholds, which is something that certain cities, such as Coolidge, already do. \n \n\u201c(The bill would mean) allowing counties to have that same flexibility,\u201d he said. \u201c(But) this would still have to go to the voters,\u201d as opposed to individual cities and towns, which would typically adopt the tax via their city or town councils. \n \nBut others disagree. \n \nThe Arizona Free Enterprise Club posted a press release Jan. 19 explaining its reasoning to oppose the legislation. \n \n\u201cThe Club recently shed light on the effort in Pinal County to ask voters to approve an additional half-cent transportation tax increase on top of the current transit tax,\u201d the release states. \u201cFollowing a series of State Auditor General reports, the existing tax \u2014 which dates back to the late \u201980s \u2014 has a long recorded history of misuse and misallocation of funds. \n \n\u201cTransportation dollars have been used to give Christmas bonuses to city employees and the majority of the dollars are being allocated to the politically powerful municipalities in the county and not going toward needed regional road projects.\u201d \n \nIt goes on to state that because auto dealers, home builders and taxpayer watchdog groups put pressure on the Pinal RTA with their opposition, it backed down from \u201cforcing a vote\u201d and has had to bounce back from criticism over an apparent $640 million spending spree. \n \nThat, the release alleges, is why Shope was brought into the mix to introduce the legislation. \n \nAt Wednesday\u2019s Board of Supervisors meeting, County Manager Greg Stanley called the critique \u201ckind of a bogus reference,\u201d to the existing half-cent sales tax and insisted that the county has never misused transportation dollars, though some issues pertaining to the half-cent sales tax have come from some of the smaller cities and towns. \n \nIt was not clear which ones Stanley was referencing. \n \nScot Mussi of the Arizona Free Enterprise Club told PinalCentral that through the club\u2019s own research, \u201cthe components of the tax probably are misguided,\u201d and \u201cthe bill itself is very narrow.\u201d The club\u2019s opinion, he said, is to prioritize construction of regional \u2014 not local \u2014 projects. \n \nBecause the bill has yet to be heard in committee, Mussi said it\u2019s difficult to gauge where many lawmakers stand, but the club\u2019s representatives will likely come forward to lawmakers and policymakers with their concerns that the bill is \u201cproviding carveouts in the tax code.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe last thing we should be doing is providing exemptions for particular industries,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d \n \nShope didn\u2019t make any kind of a response to the Arizona Free Enterprise Club\u2019s criticism. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to do with how Pinal County (government) operates,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just a humble legislator\u2026 I\u2019m the vehicle to move that bill.\u201d \n \nBut one organization remaining in his corner is Pinal Partnership, one of the advocates for the RTA. \n \nJackob Andersen, vice chairman of the Board of Directors and president of Saint Holdings, said no one from the Arizona Free Enterprise Club has ever talked to him about the matter, but regardless, he thinks the bill makes sense. \n \n\u201cInfrastructure in roadways is very important for economic development,\u201d he said, adding that in order to attract business and manufacturers to Arizona, access to good transportation is essential. \n \nThere would be a much higher chance, he said, of attracting industries and commerce to the area with existing infrastructure, which would \u201cbenefit the entire community\u201d when those workers buy or rent local homes, use local gas stations, send their kids to local schools and more. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a positive bill that really allows the county to be in the same place a city would be (and) be able to reduce the taxes (which is) only good for the taxpayer,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a positive thing.\u201d \n \nBut it\u2019s still uncertain \u2014 the bill still has to be approved by the House and then the Senate in order to go to the voters to ultimately decide whether it becomes reality.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Transportation industry

Our country was spoiled for decades with Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Jim Courier, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras displaying the superiority of the United States. \n \nIn women's tennis, it's not a problem. The American Williams sisters \u2014 especially Serena \u2014 have dominated the sport for the last 18 years. Fittingly, Serena and Venus squared off yesterday for the first grand slam title of 2017 at the Australian Open. \n \nBut everyone loves rivalries. Whether it's Ohio State-Michigan in college football, Duke-North Carolina in college basketball or Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier in boxing. \n \nIt's why today's match with Federer and Nadal for the Australian Open title is so fantastic. \n \nThe undisputed best rivalry in men's tennis in the last dozen years is Federer-Nadal. The two all-time greats have combined for 31 grand slam titles \u2014 17 for Federer (the all-time record) and 14 for Nadal, the King of Clay. \n \nThe scintillating battles between the two have produced legendary matches, most notably when they battled nearly five hours \u2014 and through two rain delays \u2014 for the Wimbledon title in 2008. Nadal won that match 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (8-10), 9-7. \n \nIt's easy to forget the death-grip Federer and Nadal had on the sport a few years ago. From July 2005 to August 2009, they held the top two spots in the world rankings. From Wimbledon 2003 to the French Open in 2011, the duo combined to win 26 of 32 grand slam titles. \n \nIt may seem like a one-sided rivalry when you consider Nadal has a 23-11 record against the Swiss superstar, including a 9-2 mark in grand slam tournaments (6-2 in finals, 3-0 in semifinals). \n \nWhile those numbers can't be denied, many of Nadal's wins came on clay (5-0 record at the French Open), a surface where he asserted his dominance to such a degree that he became the greatest clay court player in history. \n \nBut the matches were almost always heavyweight prize fights, with both players throwing and landing big punches throughout. The battles captivated tennis fans across the globe and even casual fans. \n \nPart of the allure of this rivalry is the stark juxtaposition of the two men. \n \nFederer is the elegant, graceful master who makes everything look easy while maintaining his GQ style. He's the James Bond of tennis, casually blasting a one-handed backhand down the line like he's ordering a shaken-not-stirred martini. \n \nNadal is the lefty dirt-baller who played the first half of his career in sleeveless T-shirts and capri pants. He's anti-elegance. He runs down shots as if his life depended on it. He loudly grunts as he muscles the ball over the net with his ferocious top-spin forehand. \n \nOver time, the aura of invincibility slipped from both players \u2014 Nadal due to knee injuries and Federer to age. Djokovic took over as the greatest player on the planet in 2011 and has held that title ever since, although he fell to No. 2 in the world last November, ceding the throne to Murray. \n \nIncredibly, it's been almost six years since Federer and Nadal have played in a major final. That was the 2011 French Open, which Nadal won in four sets. \n \nToday's final \u2014 yes, it began at 1:30 a.m. Arizona time \u2014 finally brings back a historic rivalry. In truth, it's likely the last time we will ever see Federer, 35, and Nadal, 30, play one another in a grand slam final. \n \nOther terrific rivalries will emerge once these two legends fade away, but we may never see another rivalry as great as theirs. It's the Rocky Balboa-Apollo Creed of our time. \n \nRing the bell, because the heavyweight fight has resumed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The Wright Perspective: A rivalry renewed down under","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Pinal Central","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"612808623","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Pinal Central","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pinalcentral.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196353050","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Trump and his team insisted the order was not intended to target Islam and its followers, but the hashtag #muslimban trended, and many Muslims both in America and abroad said they viewed the measure as a broadly conceived and stinging exclusion. \n\nCapping a day of high-stakes drama, a federal judge in New York, Ann M. Donnelly, ordered a halt to deportations of travelers who arrived at airports with valid visas to enter the U.S., saying that sending them back to the affected countries could cause them \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d But she did not rule on the legality of the executive order, nor did she say that others who have not yet arrived in the U.S. can be allowed to proceed. \n\nOpponents of the president\u2019s directive vowed to seek a wider court win. Lawyers from groups including the American Civil Liberties Union said they intended to press ahead with efforts to overturn the president\u2019s overall order on constitutional grounds. And they rejoiced at their early victory. \n\n\u201cClearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country,\u201d said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero. \u201cOn week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n\nIn a separate and more limited ruling, a federal judge in Virginia ordered a weeklong stay against removing people with permanent U.S. residency who had been detained under the presidential order at Washington Dulles International Airport. \n\nAs the directive\u2019s effects spread, thousands staged spontaneous protests against refugee detention at airports across the country, including in Los Angeles and San Francisco. At New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, demonstrators waved signs and read from the famous Emma Lazarus poem inscribed in the Statue of Liberty. \n\nAt more than a dozen airports, including Los Angeles, Newark, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and Atlanta, immigration attorneys stepped up in droves to offer free services to those detained. \u201cA lot of tears and emotion here,\u201d said Hassan Ahmad, a lawyer from northern Virginia who hustled to Dulles airport. \n\nThe New York order appeared to affect the 100 to 200 people who were detained in transit to the United States. While the order will prevent them from being sent home, it was less clear whether they will have to remain in detention while their asylum cases are being decided. \n\nOne of the two detained Iraqis named in the case, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was an interpreter who had worked on behalf of the U.S. government. Freed after 19 hours in custody, he wept as he spoke to reporters, thanking supporters and calling America \u201cthe land of freedom, the land of rights.\u201d \n\nThe groups bringing the legal challenge, who also included the International Refugee Assistance Project and the National Immigration Law Center, said a separate motion sets the stage for a larger action involving other would-be refugees, visitors and immigrants stopped at other ports of entry. \n\nArab American advocacy groups also were reacting to the new order, warning that it was disrupting travel all over the world. \n\n\u201cWe see complete chaos in the way this has been implemented,\u201d Abed A. Ayoub, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said in a conference call with reporters. \n\nThe directive, he said, had caught up not only desperate refugees who had thought themselves within a hairsbreadth of safety, but many more with already established lives, homes and families in the United States. \u201cThis order needs to be rescinded,\u201d he said. \n\nIn another legal challenge, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would file a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. The suit, to be filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Virginia, argues that the executive order is unconstitutional because of its apparent aim of singling out Muslims. \n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that refugees \u2014 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2014 are a threat to national security,\u201d the group\u2019s national litigation director, Lena F. Masri, said in a statement. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d \n\nThe order, signed Friday by Trump during a visit to the Pentagon, suspends all refugee entries for 120 days. In addition, it indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees and bars entry to the U.S. for 90 days for those traveling from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n\nProminent Muslim figures raised their voices in opposition to the temporary refugee ban, saying children would be among those suffering the most from it. \n\nNobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by the Taliban, said in a statement that she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d that Trump was closing the door on \u201cchildren, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war.\u201d \n\nOn Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said the travel ban also covered holders of green cards, who are authorized to live and work in the U.S. Some reports have put the number of such permanent residents from the affected countries as high as half a million. \n\nAn administration official said that current green card holders from the affected countries would be allowed to remain in the U.S. \u2014 but that those caught outside the country at the time of the ban\u2019s imposition would have to be allowed back in on a case-by-case basis. Those with business overseas will have to meet beforehand with a consular official. \n\nThe measure\u2019s scope was also widened by a State Department announcement that dual nationals from the seven affected countries who also held passports from third countries such as Britain or Canada could be blocked \u2014 in effect denying U.S. entry to citizens of closely allied nations.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Laura King"},"topics":[{"name":"Los Angeles news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Trump's ban on some U.S. entries sparks confusion and protest worldwide, and legal rebukes at home","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"91203","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Glendale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Burbank Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169746369","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Burbank Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.burbankleader.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196354140","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:35:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d999c/turbine/la-na-pol-refugee-policy-20170128/600"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 2 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bernalillo","zipCode":"87125","state":"New Mexico","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Albuquerque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KOAT","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659419","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"169"},"name":"KOAT","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.koat.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196355568","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Granddaddy of the all. Top of the pops. And tennis fans are blessed in early January of 2017, to be the recipient of one more Federer vs. Nadal Grand Slam final. \nBefore we pop our popcorn and dive into the 35th edition of the rivalry, let\u2019s take a trip inside the numbers: \n\n35 Number of times Nadal and Federer have played. The pair will meet for the 12th time at a major, with Nadal holding the decisive 9-2 edge all-time. Only Federer and Djokovic (15) and Djokovic and Nadal (13) have met more at majors. \n\n23-11 Nadal owns the 23-11 lifetime edge over Federer, which includes the aforementioned 9-2 at majors. \n\nHere are some other splits: \n\nGrand Slam Finals: Nadal leads, 6-2 \nATP Finals: Nadal leads, 14-7 \nHard court: Nadal leads 9-7 \nAustralian Open: Nadal leads, 3-0 \n\n3 Nadal is one of just 3 active players who have had more than one career meeting with Federer to hold a winning head-to- head \u2013 the others are Djokovic (23-22) and Dominic Thiem (2-1). \n\n4 Federer has a losing head-to- head against just 4 players at the Grand Slams where multiple matches have been played \u2013 Nadal (2-9), Alex Corretja (0-2), Arnaud Clement (1-2) and Djokovic (6-9). \n\n28 Federer has reached his 28th career Grand Slam final in Melbourne. He has been to seven more major finals than anyone else. Nadal, meanwhile, moves into a tie with Djokovic for second all-time with 21. Here are the top four: \n\nRoger Federer 28 \nNovak Djokovic, 21 \nRafael Nadal, 21 \nIvan Lendl 19 \n\n5 This is just the fifth time in the Open Era that two players aged 30 or greater have contested a Grand Slam final. It has not happened since 2002, when Pete Sampras met Andre Agassi. It hasn\u2019t happened since 1972 in Australian when Ken Rosewall met Mal Anderson for the title. \n\n18:59 Amount of time that Nadal has spent on court during his six matches at Melbourne. Nadal needed to win five-setters vs. Alexander Zverev (4:06) and Grigor Dimitrov (4:56). Federer has spent just 13:40 on the court despite having to win multiple five-setters as well. He defeated Nishikori in the round of 16 in five sets (3:24) and Wawrinka in the semis (3:05). \n\n1.900 Combined number of wins that Federer (1086-245) and Nadal (814-175) have earned over the course of their careers. \n\n2 x 4 Nadal is bidding to become the first player in Open Era history to own two or more totals at all four Grand Slams. \n\nRoland Garros: 9 titles \nWimbledon: 2 titles \nUS Open: 2 titles \nAustralian Open: 1 title \n\n3 Nadal ended a three-match losing streak in five-setters at majors with his win over Alexander Zverev in the third round. He has reached a Grand Slam final for the first time since the 2014 French Open. \n\n3 Nadal has not won a hard court title in more than three years. He last triumphed on this surface at Doha in 2014. \n\n6 Federer is bidding to become the sixth man in Open Era history to win multiple major titles after turning 30. Ken Rosewall and Rod Laver each won four titles after turning 30, while Andre Agassi, Jimmy Connors and Stan Wawrinka have each won two. \n\n1974 At 35, Federer is the oldest male player to contest a Grand Slam final since 1974, when a 39-year-old Ken Rosewall reached the U.S. Open final.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Nadal, Federer, Edition 35, By the Numbers","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tennis Now","feed":{"genre":"Blog","tags":[],"id":"602868405","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"8"},"name":"Tennis Now","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","Tennis"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tennisnow.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196357819","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President.

They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq.

It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

They led 40-32 at halftime and outscored the conference-leading Apaches 26-21 in the fourth quarter. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy this one,\u201d Cardenas said. \u201cWe\u2019re really good when our intensity and effort are there, and hopefully something good will come out of this. The inconsistency we\u2019ve had all year has been tough.\u201d \n \nCentral entered the game tied with Eastern Arizona in the battle for the third and final berth in the Division I Region 1 tournament. The Vaqueras have nine games remaining to make up ground on Cochise and Arizona Western, which was 10-2 in the ACCAC going into Saturday\u2019s game against D-II South Mountain. \n \nCAC limited the Apaches to a shooting percentage of .373. Cochise, which came in with a conference-best .438 figure, went 5 for 23 on 3-pointers and 28 of 75 overall. \n \nThe Vaqueras shot 42 percent, but made just 28 of 45 free throws. They were 14 of 20 in the fourth quarter, however. \n \n\u201cWe made them down the stretch, but it would have been a lot easier on ourselves if we had made them the whole game,\u201d Cardenas said. \n \nA 3-pointer by Juliet Currency extended Central\u2019s lead to 73-62 with 3:50 to play. The Vaqueras did not make another field goal until Tate Tsingine\u2019s basket \u2014 a straight-on 17-footer \u2014 snapped a 76-76 tie with 35.7 seconds remaining. \n \nAfter Cochise was called for a charging foul with 17.3 seconds left, Jamie Young made 1 of 2 free throws with 14.7 seconds to play. Sophia Elenga\u2019s attempt at a tying 3-pointer missed with four seconds left, and Huma clinched the win by making two free throws with 0.3 seconds remaining. \n \nCentral\u2019s Kiara Knox scored a game-high 24 points, going 7 for 12 from the field and 10 for 16 from the line. Currency finished with 14 points and was perfect on the day, making 4 of 4 shots from the floor, including 2 of 2 3-pointers, and 4 of 4 free throws. Tsingine scored 13 points and KeShara Scott had 11. \n \nEllenga missed a good portion of the game due to foul trouble but still led the Apaches with 20 points, followed by Sophia Anaya with 15, Mamita Diagne with 14 and Shannon Powell with 10. \n \nThere were three ties and six lead changes in the first quarter, which concluded with CAC up 19-18 following Young\u2019s 3-pointer with 18 seconds left. \n \nCochise outscored CAC 23-15 in the third quarter, which ended in a 55-55 tie. The Vaqueras committed nine turnovers in the period on 22 possessions. Cochise went up 53-51 on Anaya\u2019s 3-pointer with 2:05 left and 55-51 on two free throws by Anaya with 1:09 remaining.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Vaqueras edge first-place Cochise","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Pinal Central","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"612808623","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Pinal Central","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pinalcentral.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196368906","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Forsyth","zipCode":"27116","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Winston Salem","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WXII 12","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688608","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"92"},"name":"WXII 12","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wxii12.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196369872","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://hips.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/traveler-released-at-jfk-airport-1485651543.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2707","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Coleambally","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Coly Point Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"348313719","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Coly Point Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.colypointobserver.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196372017","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

A recently announced $100 million legacy gift to fund the creation of an educational leadership institute for Texas public school administrators will go a long way to support those who have worked tirelessly for decades with a broken public school finance system and a high stakes accountability system. \n \nThe Holdsworth Center , named after Butt\u2019s mother Mary Elizabeth Holdsworth Butt , who was a school teacher before she married, will be located in Austin. It will serve the more than 1,200 school districts across the state. In its inaugural year the center will begin a two-year leadership training program for superintendents. The second year the center will see the launch of a two-year program for principals. \n \nParticipants in the institute\u2019s training will be exposed to leadership experts from the public and private sectors, provide an opportunity for the sharing of best practices and will include international travel to study effective programs in operation. \n \nThe center is a game changer for Texas public education. Some districts are effective at developing in-house talent, which allows them to promote from within. However many districts lack the resources necessary to accomplish that and often have to pay top dollar for nationwide searches for top administrative slots. \n \nHaving the right leadership in place is key to a school district\u2019s success. It is estimated that more than 3,000 administrators will benefit from the center\u2019s services in the first 10 years. \n \nThe center will begin training this summer with representatives from six districts selected from a short list of 15 that have been invited to apply.

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n \n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n \n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n \nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n \n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n \n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\" \n \n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Brown","zipCode":"54311","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Green Bay","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WTAQ News Talk","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"190016701","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"WTAQ News Talk","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wtaq.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196376858","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She owns a comparatively humble semi at Northbridge, in her Willoughby electorate. Photo: Daniel Munoz \n    exit   \nSydney's booming spring property market has delivered the new Berejiklian government a budget windfall. \n \nThe amount of residential stamp duty flowing into the state coffers hit new monthly records in November and December, Office of State Revenue figures show. \n \nThe NSW government collected $730 million from the residential property transfers last month alone \u2013 about $100 million more than the previous December. November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier. \n \nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts. \n \nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July. \n \nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier. \n \nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016. \n \nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256. \n \nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years. \n \nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability. \n \nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\". \n \nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\". \n \nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year. \n \nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets. \n \nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16. \n \nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year. \n \nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion. \n \nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Fairfield Champion","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169690000","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Fairfield Champion","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fairfieldchampion.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196377395","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Summit","zipCode":"44221","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Cuyahoga Falls","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Cuyahoga Falls Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172081056","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Cuyahoga Falls Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.cuyahogafalls.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695196380466","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Yet for some it was more than just a competition. \n \nNamaka Barclay-Kerr, Tāmaki Herenga Waka Trust says, \u201cThe biggest thing for me coming to Auckland is to increase the voyaging on traditional canoes such as single hull canoes, people's canoes and outrigger canoes amongst Māori as well as the Pacific.\u201d \n \nRiki Minhinnick, Ngāti Te Ata says, \u201cI've seen the spiritual connection a person can have with a canoe. Even with the young people, they have their own chants and talk, those sorts of things. They talk to the canoe and the canoe speaks back to them, I've seen it, I've heard it. So those types of spiritual elements is great to see in these traditional activities.\u201d \n \nHoturoa Barclay-Kerr, Tamaki Herenga Waka Trust says, \u201cThis event allows tribes from Auckland to know who their relatives are, their friends and the local tribes. It's a day that brings us all together under one activity, a healthy one given to us by our ancestors. \n \nReaching their first semi-finals were Tamaoho and Ngāti Te Ata. With Ngāti Tamaoho falling short of making the finals. \n \nTed Ngātaki, Ngāti Tamaoho says, \u201cI'm exhausted.

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n \n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n \n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n \nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n \n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n \n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\" \n \n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Ottawa","zipCode":"49422","state":"Michigan","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Holland","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WHTC.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"545869857","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"name":"WHTC.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://whtc.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196383260","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council. \n \nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet. \n \nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney. \n \nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families. \n \nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\". \n \nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections. \n \nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies. \n \nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\". \n \nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts. \n \nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state. \n \nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs. \n \nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean. \n \nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts. \n \nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation. \n \nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader. \n \nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres. \n \nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts. \n \nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities. \n \nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing. \n \nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

Why did you field a candidate in the recent Bikita West by-election? \n \nJM: Thank you very much for making time to come and have a discussion with me after the Bikita elections. First of all, let me tell you that People First respects the ideas and the will of the people. \n \nThe decision to go to Bikita West was not an individual call, it came from the people. \n \nYes, as Nera, we are talking about levelling the playing field, areas that need reforming and so on. It has not been our position that we don\u2019t participate in any election. \n \nGoing to Bikita is not something that we regret, but it is something that we agreed upon as a party. \n \nEM: After ZimPF\u2019s \u201cpoor showing\u201d, there are sentiments that you were left weakened.What is your comment on that? \n \nJM: I don\u2019t know who marks or who gives the levels at which parties should be commended as having done an excellent job at a given period of time and so on, but let me tell you that as PF, we are saluting ourselves because we are a party that has been in this business for less than a year and have done a lot under very difficult circumstances. \n \nWe went in knowing for sure we were going to encounter such problems like we have been hearing from other opposition parties we work with in Nera. \n \nWe now appreciate practically what others have been saying when they said the playing field is not level. \n \nI can now tell you the ground is not level because we have tested it. \n \nRight now I am a well-informed leader of PF that it is not fabrication that the playing field is not level. We have tested the pudding. \n \nEM: Is there any truth in the allegations that Zanu PF was engaged in vote-buying and intimidation of voters ahead of the by-election? \n \nJM: Like I said before, we experienced it. For example, when someone who is able to use an advanced iPhone would come on voting day and say \u201cI can\u2019t read and write, so help me\u201d. \n \nWe could see desks set 100m from the polling stations (manned by officials), threatening people that they were seeing who they were voting for. It was a way of frightening voters. \n \nHow on earth can we do something like this to the voters? Because of the nature of Zanu PF, people believed it and they have been telling us. \n \nThe kraal heads were told to march their people to the voting centres and this is exactly what we have been hearing and for us we can say, \u201cyes we have now witnessed that\u201d. \n \nEM: Don\u2019t you think your participation in the polls may affect your relationship with other Nera members who are pushing for electoral reforms? \n \nJM: I think about two, three days ago [Dr] Morgan Tsvangirai was in the papers informing the nation and the world that he is comfortable working with PF. \n \nI am sure he saw that we mean serious business. PF and the MDC-T are very serious about working for the freedom that the people of Zimbabwe are looking forward to. \n \nWe are not just talking about this freedom with Dr Tsvangirai\u2019s party or Dr Tsvangirai himself, but many other opposition parties. \n \nWe are doing it bilaterally, multilaterally and so on. So I don\u2019t think there will be anybody questioning our worthiness at going into a coalition. \n \nEM: There are some in ZimPF who are accusing you of failing to stamp your authority and stop Retired Colonel Makova from imposing Kudakwashe Gopo, your losing candidate in the Bikita West by-election. They say he dragged the whole party into the polls unprepared. What is your comment on that? \n \nJM: I don\u2019t understand when people are talking about authority of an individual. When you try to question such decisions, they will say we don\u2019t want one centre of power. \n \nThe decision to take Gopo as our candidate for Bikita West was not supposed to be an individual or the president\u2019s decision. \n \nIt was a party decision. It was not a Makova decision. \n \nYes, Makova was the provincial coordinator and mind you, when you are the coordinator you are just a postman, you have no decision of your own, you take the people\u2019s will and Makova was approached by the Bikita West people and he only passed it on to the party. \n \nWe discussed about the issue and agreed we were going to go into Bikita West. \n \nJM: MDC-T claimed it distanced itself from supporting you because you fielded a candidate accused of human rights violations during his time in Zanu PF. Did you learn any lessons from this? \n \nJM: As democratic forces, we wouldn\u2019t want to be seen as moving sideways. We want to be pulling together, we don\u2019t want to be creating difficulties amongst ourselves when we know for sure that we have one enemy and then we are seen creating enemies amongst ourselves, but with this situation of Bikita West, that one I didn\u2019t hear about it. If it happened it\u2019s unfortunate. \n \nEM: Do you think the problems encountered during the by-election can be resolved before the 2018 plebiscite? \n \nJM: Like I have said already, it is now the first-hand information that we can share with others who had this experience before us. \n \nBut right now as PF with this involvement, we can tell you that these things happen and we think in future we will find ways of how to really try and make things work the other way. \n \nWe now know Zanu PF has its own tactics of doing things and we have to strategise against them. \n \nEM: Are you still committed to a coalition with other opposition parties ahead of 2018 and are you happy with the progress made so far? \n \nJM: Like what I have said already, from what you have heard from Dr Tsvangirai that he is ready to work with PF and that even from our side, we are also ready to work with other democratic forces that are ready to work with us. \n \nRight now it is MDC-T we are talking to on bilateral basis, but we also have many more that we are talking to. \n \nSo for 2018, we are sure the democratic forces will be ready to work together because the enemy we are facing is one. \n \nWe are not enemies amongst ourselves as opposition parties. \n \nBut we know what the Zimbabwean people are aiming to have at the moment, so our focus is to bridge the gaps that separate us so that come 2018, which is very close, we will pull together. \n \nEM: Some observers say you and MDC-T are arrogant because you only want a coalition among yourselves. Is that how you see the talks from your side? \n \nJM: There were many issues put to thought because of us not going to Cape Town [for talks with other opposition parties last year] but that we are probably trying to get rid of other parties before 2018; that is not true. \n \nAs we have been working with other parties, and may be you noticed that many parties attended out provincial rallies. You can\u2019t say we are discriminating against other political parties. \n \nEM: Do you think your loss in Bikita will compromise your bargaining power in the negotiations? \n \nJM: I don\u2019t think there will be a compromise at all in any talks that are yet to come. In fact, it should give them confidence that PF is a force to reckon with because of what we have done is such a short space of time. \n \nIf you compare us with other parties, we have managed to participate in an election, in less than a year we have managed to register our party, in less than a year we have managed to have 10 launches in each province. \n \nSo how many parties do we have in Zimbabwe that have managed to do that in a short space of time? \nAs I am telling you right now, we have managed to come up with a constitution, having consulted countrywide. \n \nThe rural people are joining us because they are saying this is the time that we should just show the world that no, what we fought for never came and this is the time that it should come to the people. \n \nEM: Does the lack of substantive office bearers have any bearing on the alleged infighting in your party? \n \nJM: You know it\u2019s a party that is less than a year old and I know of parties that are many years older than us that have not held their conventions, but with us a convention is inevitable and we have said it just has to be there. \n \nFor your own information, it is going to happen because our constitution is ready now and we wouldn\u2019t have gone to that convention without a document that we are satisfied with. \n \nEM: When will ZimPF be finally launched considering that it is almost a year since you first announced your intention to form a political party and that 2018 elections are drawing close? \n \nJM: I don\u2019t know why people love to talk about fights. Fights are where you see people having blood gushing all over, taking each other to courts and people paying fines and so forth. \n \nI think when people have different opinions, people want to turn them to fights, different opinions are allowed even among brothers and sisters, even between a husband a wife fights are allowed. \n \nThose are democratic processes and if you don\u2019t have such things happening, how would you then try to crystalise your process? \n \nHow are you going to come up one day and be proud of the good job that you have done in future? \n \nWhat we are doing is not only for the present. People are working on the process of having this country run properly under a good party and that party should be based on a well-set foundation and if you don\u2019t set the foundation properly, it will not go any far. \n \nSo what we are doing takes time and when we are doing it, like what we have told you, consulting people takes time. \n \nEM: Don\u2019t you think time is running out for 2018? \n \nJM: For PF, this is where democracy plays out; we have to go to and fro consulting people. It is good to see the common fabric that is running within the minds of the people. We have to take our time to know the people we are dealing with. \n \nWhat if some of them wake up one day and become informants? It\u2019s the game of politics. You need time to learn about each other, understanding issues. \n \nEM: You recently told SABC that you are ready to forgive Mugabe if you win the forthcoming elections. Can you tell us more about your position? \n \nJM: We are a Christian country, and I believe forgiveness is what we are taught and some of us we have grown to understand and if you are a leader who does not believe in forgiveness and you want to apply the rule of an eye for an eye and retributive tendencies are applied and all those ills that you can think of that cause the nation to be at each other\u2019s throat, can we call that a nation? \n \nI am sure that the nation of Zimbabwe is tired; they want peace, like what we have agreed in our Constitution. \n \nWe have a department for the peace and reconciliation because we believe in peace, like what happened, many other things happened in this country, a lot of people have pronounced a lot about Gukurahundi, they gloss over it. \n \nAs Zimbabweans, we have a culture and those are the things we say as PF we need to make sure that they are more pronounced, developed, not just for us, but for future generations. \n \nWe have our own ways of solving disputes as Zimbabwe. There are peaceful ways of addressing mistakes. \n \nEM: Having been in the ruling party for 43 years, do you miss being in government? \n \nJM: If I ask, is there a government to miss today? I don\u2019t think so. And let me tell you, with what is happening, that there is this group that is sharpening its tools to fight another group, and in PF we say we want peace, you ask yourself, would I be willing to be in such a situation. \n \nWhat role would I be playing right now? Some of us are not of the fighting spirit. \n \nRather than sitting on the terraces and watch Zanu PF decimate the little that is left of this country, it\u2019s better we join hands with democratic forces in Zimbabwe and give peace and freedom to the people of Zimbabwe. \u2013 The Standard","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[{"name":"Zimbabwe news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"MUGABE OUT: Tsvangirai, Mujuru Pact Close","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"ZimEye","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"594922147","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"ZimEye","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"https://www.zimeye.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196392328","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:56Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Trump and his team insisted the order was not intended to target Islam and its followers, but the hashtag #muslimban trended, and many Muslims both in America and abroad said they viewed the measure as a broadly conceived and stinging exclusion. \n\nCapping a day of high-stakes drama, a federal judge in New York, Ann M. Donnelly, ordered a halt to deportations of travelers who arrived at airports with valid visas to enter the U.S., saying that sending them back to the affected countries could cause them \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d But she did not rule on the legality of the executive order, nor did she say that others who have not yet arrived in the U.S. can be allowed to proceed. \n\nOpponents of the president\u2019s directive vowed to seek a wider court win. Lawyers from groups including the American Civil Liberties Union said they intended to press ahead with efforts to overturn the president\u2019s overall order on constitutional grounds. And they rejoiced at their early victory. \n\n\u201cClearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country,\u201d said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero. \u201cOn week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n\nIn a separate and more limited ruling, a federal judge in Virginia ordered a weeklong stay against removing people with permanent U.S. residency who had been detained under the presidential order at Washington Dulles International Airport. \n\nAs the directive\u2019s effects spread, thousands staged spontaneous protests against refugee detention at airports across the country, including in Los Angeles and San Francisco. At New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, demonstrators waved signs and read from the famous Emma Lazarus poem inscribed in the Statue of Liberty. \n\nAt more than a dozen airports, including Los Angeles, Newark, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and Atlanta, immigration attorneys stepped up in droves to offer free services to those detained. \u201cA lot of tears and emotion here,\u201d said Hassan Ahmad, a lawyer from northern Virginia who hustled to Dulles airport. \n\nThe New York order appeared to affect the 100 to 200 people who were detained in transit to the United States. While the order will prevent them from being sent home, it was less clear whether they will have to remain in detention while their asylum cases are being decided. \n\nOne of the two detained Iraqis named in the case, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was an interpreter who had worked on behalf of the U.S. government. Freed after 19 hours in custody, he wept as he spoke to reporters, thanking supporters and calling America \u201cthe land of freedom, the land of rights.\u201d \n\nThe groups bringing the legal challenge, who also included the International Refugee Assistance Project and the National Immigration Law Center, said a separate motion sets the stage for a larger action involving other would-be refugees, visitors and immigrants stopped at other ports of entry. \n\nArab American advocacy groups also were reacting to the new order, warning that it was disrupting travel all over the world. \n\n\u201cWe see complete chaos in the way this has been implemented,\u201d Abed A. Ayoub, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said in a conference call with reporters. \n\nThe directive, he said, had caught up not only desperate refugees who had thought themselves within a hairsbreadth of safety, but many more with already established lives, homes and families in the United States. \u201cThis order needs to be rescinded,\u201d he said. \n\nIn another legal challenge, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would file a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. The suit, to be filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Virginia, argues that the executive order is unconstitutional because of its apparent aim of singling out Muslims. \n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that refugees \u2014 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2014 are a threat to national security,\u201d the group\u2019s national litigation director, Lena F. Masri, said in a statement. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d \n\nThe order, signed Friday by Trump during a visit to the Pentagon, suspends all refugee entries for 120 days. In addition, it indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees and bars entry to the U.S. for 90 days for those traveling from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n\nProminent Muslim figures raised their voices in opposition to the temporary refugee ban, saying children would be among those suffering the most from it. \n\nNobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by the Taliban, said in a statement that she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d that Trump was closing the door on \u201cchildren, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war.\u201d \n\nOn Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said the travel ban also covered holders of green cards, who are authorized to live and work in the U.S. Some reports have put the number of such permanent residents from the affected countries as high as half a million. \n\nAn administration official said that current green card holders from the affected countries would be allowed to remain in the U.S. \u2014 but that those caught outside the country at the time of the ban\u2019s imposition would have to be allowed back in on a case-by-case basis. Those with business overseas will have to meet beforehand with a consular official. \n\nThe measure\u2019s scope was also widened by a State Department announcement that dual nationals from the seven affected countries who also held passports from third countries such as Britain or Canada could be blocked \u2014 in effect denying U.S. entry to citizens of closely allied nations.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Laura King"},"topics":[{"name":"Los Angeles news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Trump's ban on some U.S. entries sparks confusion and protest worldwide, and legal rebukes at home","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Orange","zipCode":"92626","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Costa Mesa","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Coastline Pilot","feed":{"genre":"Obituaries","tags":[],"id":"169753712","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Coastline Pilot","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.coastlinepilot.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196393419","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:35:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d99bc/turbine/la-na-pol-refugee-policy-20170128/600"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 4 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"40202","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Louisville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Louisville Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"540"},"name":"Louisville Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196394438","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The 25-year-old has established himself as one of the top players in world football during his time with Atleti, and in turn it\u2019s no surprise to see Premier League clubs interested in his securing his signature. According to The Daily Mail, Arsenal are ready to rival United having failed with an initial bid to sign him last summer and although the Red Devils remain the favourites to land the French international, it\u2019s claimed that the Gunners are ready to make their move. It\u2019s added that Griezmann would cost £85m, as set by the release clause in his contract, and that Arsenal would be open to paying more than £250,000-a-week to a player of the forward\u2019s calibre. Both Chelsea and Manchester City are also mentioned in the report as ultimately both have the resources to rival their Premier League counterparts, but it appears as though United lead the way with Arsenal set to compete with them at this stage. United would have to be favoured given that it would be an unprecedented amount of money for Arsenal to spend, while there is also the additional role that Paul Pogba could play in persuading his international teammate to join him at Old Trafford. In turn, Jose Mourinho could be adding another marquee signing to his squad this summer, with the report adding that Atleti may well feel as though the time is right to cash in on their prolific Frenchman. Griezmann has scored 52 goals in 94 La Liga appearances since joining the capital club from Real Sociedad in 2014, but it looks as though he\u2019ll have two big options to start a new challenge in England ahead of next season.

The 27-year-old has had a torrid time with injuries since moving to Anfield in 2012, and it appears as though patience could finally be running out. According to The Mirror, although Klopp acknowledges the England international\u2019s quality in the final third and his goalscoring record when fully fit, it hasn\u2019t been consistent enough and it\u2019s claimed that the German tactician believes the time is right to find another solution at the end of the season. Sturridge made 29 Premier League appearances in the 2013/14 campaign, but aside from that, he has failed to feature in more than 14 outings in the other three seasons that he\u2019s been with the Merseyside giants. So far this season, he has been limited to a substitute role for the most part, scoring six goals and providing three assists in 20 appearances in all competitions. If Liverpool want to become genuine Premier League title contenders, and compete in Europe if they qualify for the Champions League this season, then they need more from a star striker and ultimately Sturridge is not providing them with that consistent source of goals. Any exit could be problematic though with no top clubs reportedly interested at this point, while Liverpool may have a tough time prising away two replacements named in the report, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Inaki Williams of Borussia Dortmund and Athletic Bilbao respectively on their radar. While it remains to be seen who would come in, it does finally appear as though Liverpool could be ready to make a change. In fairness, it\u2019s a long time coming as Sturridge has been a source of real frustration for some time with his inability to stay fit and lead the team.

The 31-year-old has been strongly linked with a switch to the Far East over the last week, and those rumours only seem to be intensifying as the days go on. According to The Mirror, not only is Rooney in line to be offered a contract worth a staggering £140m, which would make him the highest-paid footballer in the world, but it\u2019s claimed that Jose Mourinho and the club hierarchy are in agreement over letting him go. While the European transfer window closes on Tuesday, Chinese Super League clubs can sign new recruits up until February 28 and so a transfer war is expected to break out with several top sides hoping to persuade Rooney to become their marquee signing. It\u2019s added by the Mirror that the chance to free themselves of Rooney\u2019s hefty wages at Old Trafford will in turn give United more flexibility in their push to sign Antoine Griezmann this summer, and so it seems like a generally smart move from the Red Devils. From Rooney\u2019s perspective, the England international has gradually become a bit-part player at United and is seemingly set for a more regular role on the bench under Mourinho. Having recently surpassed Sir Bobby Charlton to move up to top spot in the club\u2019s all-time top goalscorer\u2019s list, and with countless trophies to show for his efforts during his time with the Premier League giants, perhaps it is the most sensible time to move on with his legacy already secured. With the likes of Marcus Rashford, Juan Mata, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Anthony Martial fighting him for a spot in the starting line-up, coupled with the ridiculous money on offer from China, it would be no surprise if Rooney decided that the time was right to make the most of the opportunity.

A lawsuit brought by states would heighten the legal stakes surrounding the president's executive order, signed late on Friday, as courtroom challenges to the ban have so far mostly been filed by individuals. \n \nOfficials in the offices of attorneys general in Pennsylvania, Washington and Hawaii said on Saturday they were evaluating what specific claims could be filed, and in which court. \n \n\"We do believe the executive order is unconstitutional,\" Hawaii attorney general Douglas Chin told Reuters on Saturday. He declined to give further detail. \n \nThe states could decide not to file, and it is unclear how many states would ultimately sign on for such an effort. \n \n\"There certainly are conversations underway,\" said Joe Grace, a spokesman for Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro. \n \nA Trump representative could not be reached immediately for comment. \n \nTrump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. He told reporters in the Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \"not a Muslim ban\" and said the measures were long overdue. \n \nHowever, his order hit a roadblock late on Saturday when a federal judge in New York said stranded travelers could stay in the country. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the emergency court order, said it would help 100 to 200 people with valid visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports after Trump signed the order. \n \nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it would comply with judicial orders but that Trump's immigration restrictions remained in effect. \n \n(Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco; Editing by Paul Tait)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"States discussing lawsuit over Trump immigration order","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Queens","zipCode":"11378","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Maspeth","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Queens Ledger","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169774593","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Queens Ledger","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.queensledger.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196399882","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Now 31 years old, he has started more games and played more minutes than any Sounder. \n\nHe was involved in setting up Fredy Montero for the Sounders\u2019 first MLS goal in the spring of 2009. And he was on the field for 120 minutes, despite a badly sprained knee, when the Sounders topped Toronto FC on penalty kicks to win the MLS title on Dec. 10. \n\n\u201cFrom the beginning until now \u2026 it was like raising a baby,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cLittle by little, crawling, then walking, then running and making the championship. I\u2019m very, very happy to be a part of this.\u201d \n\nSchmetzer said he knew there was no way Alonso would miss that title game, even though he was considered questionable with the knee injury suffered in the semifinals. \n\n\u201cOzzie was never going to not play in this game, and that\u2019s a testament to how tough he is,\u201d Schmetzer said after the title game. \u201cHe had to get an injection and had another injection at halftime just to keep himself in the game. He\u2019s just tough as nails.\u201d \n\nMore than his toughness powered him that night. Who had come so far and risked so much to get there? Besides, his family was there \u2014 his entire family \u2014 on that frigid night in Toronto. His wife, children, mother, father and sister. \n\nIt was the culmination of a series of dramatic events, starting with Alonso\u2019s daring defection from Cuba, abandoning his life at home with his family for the chance to play professional soccer in America. \n\nHe gained his citizenship in 2012, and with the eventual warming of relations with Cuba, his family relocated to Miami. \n\nAlonso\u2019s unusual gateway to freedom was a Walmart in Houston, where he sprinted away from his visiting Cuban U-23 national team in June 2007. He had no plans and no contacts, just the vision of himself playing in the MLS. \n\nFrom the moment the Sounders took the field the first time in 2009, Alonso showed himself as someone who defended with a linebacker\u2019s intensity, but could pass like a point guard. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until September 2015, though, that his father and inspiration, Osvaldo Alonso Sr., was able to get to America to see the son he had coached since he was 5. By then, Osvaldo the younger had become an MLS All-Star with a family of his own. \n \nA steadying force for the Sounders as he matured, Alonso\u2019s play and leadership was critical last summer when the team stood ninth in the 10-team Western Conference. Schmetzer replaced seminal coach Sigi Schmid, and star player Clint Dempsey was sidelined with an irregular heartbeat in late August. \n\nBut the Sounders put together an 8-2-4 record under Schmetzer and then roared through the  \n\nplayoffs. \n\n\u201cWe believed we were capable of playing better, and little by little, step by step, we fought back,\u201d Alonso said. \n\nOne of the great images after the championship was of Alonso holding the cup over his head, screaming toward the sky, eyes squinting in joy. \n\nWhat could that moment have been like for him? To win the title, in front of his entire family, at the cost of having sacrificed so many years apart from them? \n\nAlonso nodded, and tapped his heart. \n\n\u201cYes, it was emotional,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was hard to bring them here, then to get to the championship, and for them to see us win. Very emotional. Very, very emotional.\u201d \n\nAnd inspirational. \n\nIf anybody needs an example of how dramatically sports can change a person\u2019s life, or how far dedication and hard work can take one, or what it means to have the heart of a champion, they need only consider the experience of Osvaldo Alonso.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Dave Bolingdboling@thenewstribune.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: MLS news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The irrepressible heart of midfielder Osvaldo Alonso","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Thurston","zipCode":"98501","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Olympia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bellingham Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658696","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1606"},"name":"Bellingham Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Soccer","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bellinghamherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196400069","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:54Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n\nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n\n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n\n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n\n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n\nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n\nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n\nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n\nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n\nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n\nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n\nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n\nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n\nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n\nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n\nReleased under special circumstances \n\nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n\nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n\n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n\nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n\nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n\nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n\nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n\n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n\n'The executive order is unlawful' \n\nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n\nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n\n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n\nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n\n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n\nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n\nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n\n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n\nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n\nLegality questioned \n\nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n\nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n\n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n\nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n\nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n\n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n\n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"DHS complies with judge to limit 'Muslim ban'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lehigh","zipCode":"18103","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Allentown","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WFMZ-TV Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667303","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"650"},"name":"WFMZ-TV Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wfmz.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196401201","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

This doesn\u2019t just include people coming directly from those nations, but anyone holding a dual-citizenship in one of those countries. This includes Green Card holders with a citizenship in one of the seven countries, and perhaps most importantly for many Canadian Dimension readers, applies to any Canadian citizen who happens to have a dual citizenship with one of the aforementioned countries. In such a scenario, an Iranian-Canadian who has lived her entire adult life in Canada is affected by this policy, and is currently unable to travel to the United States. \n \nCondemnation to Trump\u2019s executive order has been swift from millions of individuals and numerous organizations. There have been solidarity strikes from New York cab drivers, large protests at John F. Kennedy and O\u2019Hare airports , and a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union. But of vital importance is the response of Canada\u2019s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. \n \nShortly after the policy announcement, Justin Trudeau put out a response that \u2014 in philosophical and rhetorical terms \u2014 captured the feelings of many Canadians on this issue. Without mentioning a specific policy or a specific U.S. President, Trudeau said the following on Twitter: \n   \nTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada \n\u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 28, 2017   \nHe also tweeted a picture with a Syrian child refugee and the same hashtag, harking back to his efforts to bring in thousands of refugees in late 2015 and early 2016. \n \nThe tweet was elegant and effective, drawing praise from Canadians and people around the world. But a more direct condemnation is required, if not immediately, than as soon as is possible. The reality is that Trudeau\u2019s tweet, however well-crafted, fails to capture the severity of the issue as it stands. As Canada\u2019s head of state, he needs to acknowledge that this isn\u2019t just an issue of people \u201cfleeing persecution, terror & war,\u201d but one about the day-to-day lives of thousands of Canadians, who by virtue of their heritage are now banned from the United States. Whether for business, pleasure, or family, many Canadians have lost a key measure of mobility. \n \nOne of Trudeau\u2019s key goals as Prime Minister is to promote and defend the interests of all Canadians at home and abroad, regardless of class, creed, race, or gender. And if he doesn\u2019t use Canada\u2019s full diplomatic weight to defend Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Yemeni, Sudani, Libyan, and Somalian Canadians, he will have failed in one of his key responsibilities. \n \nIn the coming hours and days, Trudeau and his cabinet need to work hard to defend the interests and rights of Canadian citizens, and little should be left off the table in such discussions. Trudeau should consider any or all of the following: \n Direct and public condemnation of Trump\u2019s policy in particular, and its impact in general  A cancellation of his scheduled meeting with the Trump regime  A decree that no member of his caucus will travel to the United States until thousands of Muslim Canadians have that right restored  Refuse to have other important discussions \u2014 be they about pipelines or NAFTA \u2014 until this issue is resolved  \nThe Prime Minister needs to remain tactful here, and has done so thus far, but the clock on such an issue moves fast, and unless he and his core team are assertive and stalwart in their defense of Canadian citizens, he will deserve condemnation. \n \nChristo Aivalis, a member of the CD web committee, is an adjunct professor of history at Queen\u2019s University. His dissertation examined Pierre Trudeau\u2019s relationship with organized labour and the CCF-NDP, and has been accepted for publication with UBC Press.

This is not a drill. This is a time for action. \n \nTrump\u2019s ban affects asylum seekers, immigrants and any and all travellers from seven countries: Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. This includes resident green card holders trying to return to the U.S. from travel for personal or work reasons. The U.S. State Department has also confirmed this includes dual citizens from these seven countries, an outrageous and draconian measure that could affect hundreds of thousands of Canadians, including the Canadian Immigration Minister, since he came to Canada as a refugee from Somalia. \n \nThis afternoon Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded to Trump, albeit indirectly. \n   \nTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada \n\u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 28, 2017   \nOne one level this is great but the present moment calls for more than just subtweeting. Trudeau must stand up and explicitly confront Trump by demanding a repeal of these discriminatory orders and the safeguarding of equal travel rights for all. \n \nMake no mistake, this is Trump\u2019s long-promised Muslim ban. His regime is starting to implement the xenophobic measures they talked about time and again at rallies during the primaries and the general election. Those who downplayed the risk of Trump\u2019s campaign trail rhetoric were tragically mistaken; the threat of fascism must be taken literally and seriously. \n \nTo protect those directly affected and threatened by Trump\u2019s Muslim ban, the Canadian government should immediately grant temporary visas to anyone otherwise accepted for entry who is denied under trump\u2019s racist and unconstitutional measures. Trudeau should also cancel the so-called \u201c Safe Third Country Agreement .\u201d A LeadNow petition initiated by No One Is Illegal, which already has over 15,000 signatories, explains: \n  \nShockingly, if an asylum seeker currently in the US showed up at the Canadian border trying to escape deportation to an unsafe country \u2013 Canada would turn them away. Canada doesn\u2019t accept any asylum seekers who come to Canada via the US, because of an outdated law called the \u201cSafe Third Country Agreement\u201d. This law prevents most people fleeing violence or persecution from seeking refuge in Canada if they land in the US \u2013 deemed a \u201csafe country\u201d under the law \u2013 first. \n  \n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, among others, has already filed suit against the Trump administration for what it describes as \u201cunlawful\u201d orders. \n \nIt is also time for the European Union to step up. France and Germany have done well in voicing their opposition to Trump\u2019s decision but in the coming months and years the EU will have to use all of its political capital to withstand the U.S. president. After all Trump is close to Theresa May and Vladimir Putin, two leaders who do not hide their disdain for the EU. As the right-wing rises in the West, there are fewer countries left that can counter this threat. In Europe, a continent that not so long ago witnessed the full horrors of fascism, the threat is of course not just Trump\u2019s influence but also long-established far right parties and movements. Keeping the doors open to refugees and countering right-wing demagoguery against Muslims and immigrants is of the utmost importance. \n \nJustin Trudeau and the Liberal government have been rightfully credited for being more open to Syrian refugees than Harper\u2019s Conservatives. But we must demand much more. With the rise of the far right in the U.S. and worldwide, not to mention a future in which climate refugees will become ever more numerous, Canada and other states need to welcome more asylum seekers and refugees. In the longer-term, we must work toward a total remaking of Canada\u2019s exploitative and discriminatory immigration system. \n \nThere is every indication, with people like Steve Bannon running the show, that Trump\u2019s Muslim ban is just the beginning. If enough countries act to offset Trump\u2019s policies, a lot of needless human suffering can be alleviated. \n \nThis article originally appeared on Ricochet.media . \n  Related Reading","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jahanzeb Hussain & Derrick O\u2019Keefe"},"topics":[{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Trump\u2019s racist travel ban requires more than just condemnation","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"CA","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Canadian Dimension","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170013472","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"Canadian Dimension","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.canadiandimension.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/hashtag/WelcomeToCanada?src=hash","https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/825438460265762816","http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/laws-policy/menu-safethird.asp","https://you.leadnow.ca/petitions/tell-trudeau-welcome-those-fleeing-violence-and-deportation-under-trump?source=noii&bucket=noii","http://www.france24.com/en/20170128-france-germany-ayrault-gabriel-donald-trump-moves-limit-refugees","https://ricochet.media/en/1638/trumps-racist-travel-ban-requires-more-than-just-condemnation"],"sequenceId":"695196408248","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T03:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kotz   Canadian Politics , USA Politics   January 28, 2017 \n \nPhoto by Alek S. \n  \nOn November 8 the rise of a right-wing nationalist regime in the United States became a realistic possibility, if not now then in the coming years. Such regimes stress nationalist and patriotic themes, play upon and intensify fear of minority ethnicities and/or religions and/or other long-oppressed groups, promise to resolve festering economic problems of ordinary people, and direct the blame for such problems at a convenient scapegoat such as foreigners or immigrants rather than the real causes. Such regimes, if consolidated, invariably restrict long-established individual rights and introduce, or intensify, the use of extra-legal violent methods at home and abroad. This possibility has sent shock waves throughout U.S. society, including in the long-ruling establishment, creating a sense of chaos in which it seems anything can happen. \n \nThe greatest danger is the political coalition that emerged on November 8. Such coalitions have underpinned right-wing nationalist regimes in the past. It is made up of traditional right-wing constituencies suddenly combined with significant parts of the working class. Such a political base, held together by the above themes and promises, can enable a right-wing nationalist regime to emerge in a democratic capitalist system even without the upstart demagogic leader winning an absolute majority. \n \nThe sequence of economic developments in the United States that fostered this political trajectory is some 25 years of oppressive neoliberal capitalism, which gave rise to a severe economic crisis in 2008, followed by an unresolved economic stagnation. The current stagnation intensified the process that has been destroying the lives of working people of all races, ethnicities, genders, citizenship-status, and sexual preference, while those at the top have taken an increasing share of the slowly growing pie with the blessings of the establishment. At the same time, none of the wings of the establishment has been able to offer a real solution within the constraints of the still surviving neoliberal form of capitalism. \n \nThis situation forms the soil from which both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders suddenly emerged earlier this year. Self-described socialist Senator Bernie Sanders won about 12 million votes mainly from working class people including young people of every ethnicity. This occurred despite an all-out campaign against him by the establishment media, whose backers evidently viewed Sanders\u2019 reformist program as a bigger threat than Trump\u2019s misogynist, racist, anti-immigrant, neo-fascist pose. Support for Sanders was driven by desperation among ordinary people looking for some solution to the problems faced by themselves, their families, friends, and communities, and his left-wing proposals made sense to them. \n \nThe world has not seen an economic crisis similar to that of today since the 1920s-30s, when economic stagnation or decline took hold throughout much of the capitalist world. That period ultimately gave rise to three different trajectories. right-wing nationalist regimes arose in Germany, Italy, Spain, and Japan. Progressive reformist regimes appeared in Scandinavia, France, the U.K., and the United States And various forms of state socialism were consolidated, or newly emerged, in the USSR, Eastern Europe, China, northern Korea, and northern Vietnam. \n \nA key factor in the reactionary and reformist outcomes was the role of left wing political forces, which had significant support in society. In Germany the radical left did not unite with the social democratic center, and this played a major role in Hitler\u2019s improbable rise to power. In the United States, the rapidly growing radical left, which was influential in Hollywood while leading the trade union upsurge of industrial workers in the 1930s, followed a policy of uniting with centrist forces in society and supporting the reforms of the New Deal. \n \nThat center-left coalition played a major role in pulling the Roosevelt Administration, which at first had no clear direction, toward a policy of economic and social reform that relieved the suffering of millions of working people of all ethnicities, particularly in the U.S. South. As a result, right-wing nationalist demogogues (Father Coughlin, Huey Long) were never able to get political traction on a national scale, and Roosevelt decisively won every election. \n \nShortly after World War II the New Deal political coalition evolved into one that gave rise to the postwar system of regulated capitalism with rising wages, low unemployment, and expanding social programs, along with the Cold War and U.S. imperialist military interventions around the world. That system provided favorable conditions for the rise of new movements to end oppression of African Americans, women, and gays and lesbians, to stop foreign interventions, and to reign in the growing environmental costs of capitalist expansion and the health costs to workers. \n \nThe inevitable backlash against the above forms of social progress has now joined with the growing desperation of large numbers of working people to bring us to our present pass. As before in history, these same conditions have also produced a suddenly relevant political left in the United States Evidence of this appeared in February of this year when 43% of likely Iowa Democratic caucus participants said their political identity was \u201csocialist.\u201d While Nov. 8 opened a disastrous prospect of a future even worse than the 35 years of neoliberal capitalism, the future is not yet determined. \n \nWhat the progressive community does in the coming years matters. There is no simple lesson for us from the past, but one that seems to be speaking to us is that progress of any sort requires a broad coalition of various oppressed constituencies and their representations in the political center and left. This will require taking seriously the grievances and fears of every group. Another lesson is that the aim of preventing fascism may require the building of a growing left-wing movement, given its still weak condition in the United States. We must find a way to simultaneously defend all of the groups and interests now under threat while building a movement that can ultimately bring about a future embodying all of our common values, including cooperation, caring, sharing, equality, individual rights, economic security, and last but not least environmental sustainability. Fully securing those values will ultimately require passing beyond the capitalist system. \n \nDavid M.

WENDY JOY HILGENBERG, Respondent/Appellant. \n No. SD34362      Decided: January 17, 2017  Appellant's Attorney: Gregory R. Bridges, of Neosho, Missouri Respondent Pro Se: Joseph H. Hilgenberg, of Neosho, Missouri \nWendy Joy Hilgenberg (\u201cWife\u201d) appeals the trial court's \u201cJudgment of Dissolution of Marriage,\u201d dated January 12, 2015, dissolving her marriage to Joseph Harold Hilgenberg (\u201cHusband\u201d). In two points on appeal, Wife alleges trial court error in awarding physical custody of the minor children to Husband, and the division of marital property. Finding no preserved issues before us, we dismiss Wife's appeal. \n \nFactual and Procedural History \n \nHusband and Wife were married on November 23, 2000. Two children were born of the marriage: SHH and PJH, who were ages 10 and 13 respectively at the time of trial. The parties separated on August 12, 2013. On the same day, Husband filed a petition for dissolution of marriage asserting it was in the best interest of the minor children that joint legal and physical custody be awarded to Husband and Wife, with Husband being designated as the \u201cresidential custodian for address and educational purposes.\u201d Husband also requested a division of the marital property, which included the marital home and five acres. \n \nTrial was held on December 4, 2014 and December 19, 2014. On January 12, 2015, the trial court entered its \u201cJudgment of Dissolution of Marriage.\u201d The trial court awarded to Husband marital property that included the marital home and five acres. The trial court ordered the minor children to be placed in the joint legal custody of Husband and Wife, and in the physical custody of Husband. The trial court also adopted Husband's proposed parenting plan. \n \nOn January 26, 2015, Wife filed a \u201cMotion to Set Aside Decision, Amend, Reconsider, or Alternatively for New Trial\u201d (\u201cpost-trial motion\u201d). Wife asserted, in part, that the trial court failed to make specific findings as to the custody of the minor children, in accordance with sections 452.375.2, 452.375.4, and 452.375.6, 1 and erred in adopting Husband's parenting plan. Wife also asserted the trial court failed to make a \u201cfair and equitable distribution of the marital property.\u201d \n \nOn March 2, 2015, a hearing was held on Wife's post-trial motion. After hearing argument, the trial court requested Wife's counsel prepare a proposed judgment for the trial court's review with a copy to Husband's attorney. \n \nOn April 23, 2015, Wife filed a \u201cMotion for Extension of Time to Set Aside Decision, Amend, Reconsider, or Alternatively for New Trial\u201d and a proposed order, to grant the trial court additional time in which to rule on Wife's post-trial motion. \n \nOn May 18, 2015, the trial court signed an Order granting an extension until May 26, 2015, in which to allow the trial court sufficient time to rule on Wife's post-trial motion. On May 20, 2015, the trial court filed an \u201cAmended Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage.\u201d \n \nThereafter, Husband filed a \u201cMotion to Set Aside Order Extending Time and Amended Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage\u201d asserting: (1) that the trial court no longer had jurisdiction over the January 26, 2015 judgment due to its failure to rule on Wife's post-trial motion within 90 days, and the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter the May 20, 2015 amended judgment. \n \nOn February 23, 2016, 2 after a hearing, the trial court entered its \u201cOrder and Judgment Setting Aside Order for Exten[s]ion of Time and Amended Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage\u201d for lack of jurisdiction, and ordered the parties to comply with the terms of the January 12, 2015 Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage. Wife filed her Notice of Appeal on March 2, 2016. \n \nIn two points on appeal, Wife asserts the trial court erred in failing to make specific findings, required by section 452.375.6, when awarding the parties joint legal custody and awarding sole physical custody to Husband, and in making an inequitable distribution of the marital property, specifically in awarding the martial home and five acres to Husband. \n \nBefore we address the merits of Wife's contentions, we are required to sua sponte examine the timeliness of her notice of appeal. Douglas v. Office of the State Courts Administrator, 470 S.W.3d 29, 30 (Mo.App. W.D. 2015). \n \nRule 81.04(a) 3 requires that an appellant's notice of appeal be filed with the clerk of the trial court no later than 10 days after the judgment appealed becomes final. A notice of appeal is deemed filed on the date the trial court clerk receives the notice of appeal with a docket fee. Rule 81.04(f). Failure to timely file a notice of appeal renders the appeal ineffective. Douglas, 470 S.W.3d at 30. \n \nThe trial court entered its Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage on January 12, 2015. On January 26, 2015, Wife filed her motion to set aside the judgment or for new trial. The post-trial motion \u201craised alleged factual and legal errors in the judgment and, therefore, qualified as a motion for a new trial[,]\u201d and an \u201cauthorized after-trial motion for purposes of Rule 81.05(a).\u201d Coffer v. Wasson-Hunt, 281 S.W.3d 308, 311 (Mo. banc 2009). Because the motion was filed within 30 days of the trial court's judgment, under Rule 81.05(a)(2)(A), the filing of this post-trial motion extended the trial court's jurisdiction over the judgment to 90 days from January 26, 2015. The trial court made no ruling on the motion within 90 days, and the motion was overruled by operation of Rule 81.05(a)(2)(A) on April 26, 2015, rendering final the January 12, 2015 judgment. \n \nWife filed her notice of appeal on March 2, 2016, more than ten days after April 26, 2015. The filing was therefore untimely and ineffective as to the January 12, 2015 judgment. Rule 81.04(a). \n \nThe trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter the May 20, 2015 amended judgment, as its jurisdiction was terminated on April 26, 2015. However, under In re Estate of Shaw, 256 S.W.3d 72 (Mo. banc 2008), the fact that a court enters a judgment without jurisdiction does not preclude an appeal or deprive the appellate court of jurisdiction to consider the effect of the judgment and \u201cto confine a trial court to its jurisdiction[.]\u201d Id. at 77. \n \nThus, for the purposes described in Shaw, an appeal could have been taken from the May 20, 2015 amended judgment even though the trial court entered the amended judgment without jurisdiction. However, Wife's notice of appeal as to the May 20, 2015 amended judgment is also untimely. \n \nHusband filed a motion to set aside the amended judgment on May 26, 2015. There are no other filings in the record that constitute authorized post-trial motions to the May 20, 2015 amended judgment under Rule 81.05(a). The motion was not ruled upon by August 24, 2015, 90 days after the motion was filed, and the motion was therefore overruled pursuant to the operation of Rule 81.05(a)(2)(A). Also pursuant to Rule 81.05(a)(2)(A), the amended judgment, though entered without jurisdiction, would have been final on August 24, 2015. Wife's notice of appeal, filed March 21, 2016, was untimely and ineffective as to the amended judgment, even for Shaw purposes, inasmuch as it was filed more than ten days after the amended judgment became final. Rule 81.04(a). \n \nThe trial court entered an additional judgment on March 21, 2016\u2014setting aside its previous order for extension of time and the May 20, 2015 amended judgment\u2014after Wife filed her notice of appeal. For the same reasons as the May 20, 2015 amended judgment, the March 21, 2016 judgment was also entered without jurisdiction. Wife's notice of appeal makes reference to the trial court's ruling of February 23, 2016, which was formalized in the judgment of March 21, 2016. Wife's notice of appeal as to the March 21, 2016 judgment was therefore premature under Rule 81.05(b), which provides that premature \u201cnotice shall be considered as filed immediately after the time the judgment becomes final for the purpose of appeal.\u201d For Shaw purposes, Wife's notice of appeal was effective as to the March 21, 2016 judgment. \n \nThe March 21, 2016 judgment is the only judgment subject to review in this appeal. However, Wife's points on appeal do not raise any issue regarding the March 21, 2016 judgment, so there is no claim of error preserved for this Court's review. For that reason, Wife's appeal is dismissed. \n \nFOOTNOTES \n \n1 .  \u2003All references to statutes are to RSMo 2000, unless otherwise indicated. \n \n2 .  \u2003This Order was marked filed on March 21, 2016, by the clerk's office. \n \n3 .  \u2003All rule references are to Missouri Court Rules (2016). \n \nWILLIAM W.

Tourists prepare cash to spend while lai see money also contributes to the biggest demand for banknotes every year,\u201d she said. \n \nIt is a Chinese tradition that married people need to give lai see packets with new banknotes, usually HK$20, to children or unmarried young people, as \u201clucky money\u201d. \n \nMost Chinese companies will also give their employees a HK$100 lai see packet on the first day back at work after the Lunar New Year. \n \nTraditionally, bank customers ask for newly printed banknotes for their lai see packets. Banks usually let customers exchange old notes for new banknotes about two weeks ahead of the Lunar New Year. \n \nMany banks open earlier and close later to allow customers to exchange banknotes. \n \nThe HKMA also dispatches its own staff to monitor bank branches to make sure the exchange is as smooth as possible, Yip said \n \nShe said many customers, especially the elderly, insist on newly printed banknotes for their lai see packets as they follow the tradition that everything has to be brand new. \n \n\u201cHowever, this is not very environmentally friendly as it takes a lot of cotton and energy to make new banknotes,\u201d she said. \n \nThat\u2019s why the HKMA in 2006 launched \u201cying-san notes\u201d, or \u201cgood as new notes\u201d, which are used notes but still in a good enough condition for lai see. Banks in Hong Kong use machines to determine if banknotes are clean and good enough to use as lucky money. \n \nThis year, among all banknotes available for lai see, there are about 50 per cent that are ying-san notes while the rest are newly printed. This compares with only 20 per cent of ying-san notes when the scheme first launched in 2006. \n \n\u201cOn average, it takes about one tonne of cotton for every 1 million banknotes. With about 50 per cent of lai see banknotes as ying-san notes, we print 175 million fewer new notes, so this saves about 175 million tonnes of cotton, as well as ink and energy used for the printing, plus transportation costs,\u201d Yip said. \n \nShe said the number of banknotes in circulation are affected by the distribution of lai see money. Last year, banknotes in circulation peaked at almost HK$400 billion in February during the Lunar New Year, up from about HK$360 billion in January. However, the number went down to about HK$370 billion in March. \n \n\u201cEvery year it repeats the same cycle \u2013 parents or grandparents exchange banknotes at the banks to prepare lai see for the children. When the children use the lai see to buy toys, the shops deposit the banknotes in the bank and the money circulates back into the banking system,\u201d she said. \n \nOn average, the larger the denomination of the lai see, such as HK$1,000 or HK$500 banknotes, the faster it returns to the banking system, meaning they remain in good condition longer and can be used for two to three years before needing to be destroyed and replaced by new notes. \n \nThe HK$100 and HK$20 banknotes, the most commonly seen denominations used for lai see, are usually circulated more frequently in retail transactions before being deposited in banks, so they usually only last 18 months on average before needing replacement. \n \nBoth the Bank of East Asia and Hang Seng Bank said customers prefer newly printed banknotes for lai see money, but would accept ying-san notes if they cannot get newly printed ones. A Hang Seng Bank spokesman said the HK$20 and HK$100 banknotes were the most popular while a Bank of East Asia spokesman said HK$50 banknotes were the most popular among its customers.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Enoch Yiu"},"topics":[{"name":"Retail banking news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"China news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Hong Kong\u2019s Lunar New Year \u2018lai see\u2019 tradition is big business with 400m more banknotes in circulation","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Eastern Asia","countryCode":"HK","country":"Hong Kong"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"South China Morning Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169685908","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"216"},"name":"South China Morning Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.scmp.com","publisher":"South China Morning Post Publishers"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196411557","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:25Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/140x87/public/images/methode/2017/01/29/40803074-e464-11e6-8801-9f557f980a64_image_hires.JPG?itok=DXFrOeup"}],"video":[]}}

DAVIS, Appellant, v. STATE OF MISSOURI, Respondent. \n WD 78534      Decided: January 17, 2017  Before Division One: Thomas H. Newton, P.J., Cynthia L. Martin, and Edward R. Ardini, Jr., JJ. \nMs. Daquetta Davis appeals the circuit court decision to deny a Rule 24.035 post-conviction motion. Ms. Davis had been charged and sentenced as a prior and persistent offender under section 558.016. 1 The plea and sentencing court neglected to make statutory findings that Ms. Davis was a prior or persistent offender before the sentencing. Ms. Davis asserts that the omission of these required statutory findings invalidates the sentence. We affirm. \n \nMs. Davis pleaded guilty to two counts of the class C felony of perjury on May 23, 2013. Ms. Davis had been charged by way of indictment as a prior and persistent offender, under section 558.016. \n \nAt the plea hearing, Ms. Davis admitted that she provided false testimony under oath in February 2013. Ms. Davis also admitted that she had two prior felony convictions. Ms. Davis acknowledged that she understood that the plea agreement limited the maximum range of punishment that the plea court could impose to a ten-year sentence. The plea court accepted the guilty plea. \n \nAt the July 2013 sentencing hearing, the sentencing court imposed concurrent ten-year sentences for both counts of perjury. During the hearing, the sentencing court did not explicitly state that it was sentencing Ms. Davis as a persistent offender. The original sentence and judgment also omitted the persistent offender finding. In August 2013, the sentencing court issued an amended judgment that included the persistent offender finding. \n \nIn October 2013, Ms. Davis filed a pro se motion to vacate, set aside, or correct the judgment or sentence under Rule 24.035. Counsel timely filed an amended motion, raising two claims and incorporating Ms. Davis's pro se claims. \n \nAn evidentiary hearing was held in December 2014, and the motion court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law denying Ms. Davis's motion in March 2015. Ms. Davis filed a timely notice of appeal in April 2015. This appeal follows. \n \nLegal Analysis \n \n\u201cThis Court's review of the denial of a post-conviction motion under Rule 24.035 is limited to a determination of whether the motion court's findings of fact and conclusions of law are clearly erroneous.\u201d Cooper v. State, 356 S.W.3d 148, 152 (Mo. banc 2011). \u201cThe motion court's findings and conclusions are clearly erroneous only if, after review of the record, the appellate court is left with the definite and firm impression that a mistake has been made.\u201d Id. \u201cMovant has the burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the motion court clearly erred in its ruling.\u201d Id. \n \nGarris v. State, 389 S.W.3d 648, 650-51 (Mo. banc 2012), cert. denied, 134 S. ct. 113 (2013); Rule 24.035(k). \n \nMs. Davis argues that the motion court erred in overruling her Rule 24.035 motion because she established that the sentencing court sentenced her outside the applicable range of punishment. Ms. Davis asserts that the sentencing court incorrectly sentenced her because it failed to make the required statutory findings about her persistent offender status until after she was sentenced in violation of sections 558.016 and 558.021. We disagree. \n \nSection 558.016.3 defines a persistent offender as \u201cone who\u2024 has been found guilty of two or more felonies committed at different times.\u201d A person who is found to be a persistent offender and is found guilty of a class C felony is subject to \u201cany sentence authorized for a class B felony.\u201d §\u2002558.016.7. \n \nThe specific procedure for determining whether a defendant is a persistent offender is outlined in section 558.021. The statute requires that the indictment or information plead the essential facts warranting such a finding, evidence is introduced to establish the pleaded facts beyond a reasonable doubt, and the court makes findings of fact reflecting that the defendant is a persistent offender beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. \u201cIn a trial without a jury or upon a plea of guilty, the court may defer the proof and findings of such facts to a later time, but prior to sentencing.\u201d Id. The statute also states that \u201c[t]he defendant may waive proof of the facts alleged.\u201d Id. \n \n\u201cThe State has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant has the requisite prior convictions to subject the defendant to enhanced sentencing as a persistent offender.\u201d State v. Schnelle, 398 S.W.3d 37, 46 (Mo. App. W.D. 2013). This burden is relieved, however, \u201cwhen a defendant admits on the record that he committed previous felony crimes.\u201d State v. Gibbs, 306 S.W.3d 178, 183 (Mo. App. E.D. 2010). See O'Haren v. State, 927 S.W.2d 447, 451 (Mo. App. W.D. 1996) (\u201cMovant waived the requirement that the state prove the two prior convictions beyond a reasonable doubt when he pleaded guilty.\u201d); Schnelle, 398 S.W.3d at 46-47 (\u201cBy stating that he had no objection to being sentenced by the court due to his status as a persistent offender, and that he had no objection to the court's entry of the proposed findings proffered by the State, [the defendant] waived proof of his three prior felony convictions, and cannot now complain that the record contains insufficient evidence to establish those convictions.\u201d). \n \nMs. Davis contends that she was incorrectly sentenced because the trial court failed to make the required findings prior to her sentencing. An error of this type is considered a procedural deficiency which does not affect the judgment validity. O'Haren, 927 S.W.2d at 451 (After questioning a movant specifically about two prior convictions, the trial court failed to make specific findings concerning the nature and dates of the movant's two prior convictions. The appellate court found the trial court's findings unreviewable under Rule 24.035 and stated that an error of this type, if reviewable, would constitute a procedural deficiency with no effect on the judgment.); see Hight v. State, 841 S.W.2d 278, 282 (Mo. App. S.D. 1992). \n \nHere, the record provides sufficient evidence to establish that Ms. Davis was a persistent offender. Initially, Ms. Davis was charged as a persistent offender for two prior convictions for felonies committed at different times. 2 During the development of the factual basis for the guilty plea, Ms. Davis admitted to committing the two prior felonies. 3 In addition, Ms. Davis was advised that under her plea agreement, the plea court could sentence her to as much as ten years in prison on each count.\u2009 4 At the conclusion of Ms. Davis's plea hearing, the plea court stated that \u201cThe Court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the crime s to which she has pled guilty. A factual basis has been established for those crimes by virtue of her testimony here this afternoon.\u201d Thus, it is clear that the plea court knew and accepted that Ms. Davis had committed two felonies at separate times prior to sentencing . Finally, at Ms. Davis's sentencing, the State briefly outlined Ms. Davis's prior convictions stating: \n \nBut this defendant knows all about second chances, because she has had them right here in these same courtrooms that she came in and perverted. In this courthouse she has received drug court, which is the best treatment we have to offer, and we willingly gave her that choice, to enter into drug court and get ahold of her problem. Only when she was in drug court she picked up another case, a robbery in the first degree. \n \nThough Ms. Davis correctly contends that the trial court failed to make the required statutory findings prior to her sentencing, an error of this type has been determined to be a mere procedural deficiency that does not affect the validity of the judgment so long as the record reflects the presence of sufficient evidence to have permitted the finding prior to sentencing. Hight v. State, 841 S.W.2d at 282 (\u201c[S]o long as there is evidence to support findings of fact required to meet the present definition of persistent offender, the failure of the trial court to make specific findings has be en labeled a \u2018procedural deficiency.\u2019\u2009\u201d). After review of the record, it is plain that the trial court could have found that Ms. Davis is a persistent offender under the statute. Point denied. \n \nConclusion \n \nBecause the circuit court's omission of specific findings regarding Ms. Davis's status as a persistent offender is procedural in nature, we do not have a firm impressio n that a mistake has been made. Therefore, we affirm the circuit court's judgment. \n \nFOOTNOTES \n \n1 .  \u2003Statutory references are to RSMo (2000), as supplemented, unless otherwise indicated. \n \n2 .  \u2003Ms. Davis was convicted as a persistent offender on the basis of two felonies with different case numbers, Distribution, Delivery, Manufacture of a Control Substance and Possession of a Controlled Substance, #04CR20346301 and Robbery in the First Degree, #0516-CR05035-01. \n \n3 .  \u2003Because Ms. Davis admitted to committing these crimes on the record, the State was relieved of its burden to prove the requisite prior convictions beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Schnelle, 398 S.W.3d 37, 46 (Mo. App. W.D. 2013). \n \n4 .  \u2003The arranged sentence exceeds the maximum sentence for a Class C felony, meaning it was only by virtue of the persistent offender allegations that a ten year sentence was possible. See §\u2002558.011.1(3). \n \nThomas H. Newton, Presiding Judge \n \nMartin and Ardini, JJ. concur.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"DAQUETTA DAVIS v.

WILLARD SCHNURBUSCH, CAROL SCHNURBUSCH, Respondents-Appellants, SCHNURBUSCH LAND SERVICES, INC., Respondent. \n No. SD34345      Decided: January 20, 2017  Appellants Pro Se: Willard and Carol Schnurbusch, West Plains, Missouri Respondent's Attorney: George C. Fisher, Jr., West Plains, Missouri \nThis is an appeal by Willard Schnurbusch and Carol Schnurbusch (\u201cthe Schnurbusches\u201d), and Schnurbusch Land Services, Inc. (\u201cthe Corporation\u201d), from the trial court's entry of a \u201cFinal Judgment\u201d in favor of the West Plains Regional Animal Shelter (\u201cthe Shelter\u201d) and against the Schnurbusches and the Corporation. Finding merit to Point VII of the Schnurbusches' appeal, we reverse and remand. \n \nFactual and Procedural History \n \nIn 2006, the Schnurbusches and the Corporation filed a four-count petition against the City of West Plains (\u201cthe City\u201d) and the Shelter in Case No. 09PU-CV00849. The Schnurbusches' third amended petition alleged in Count I that the Shelter was violating the City's zoning laws, and that the City was failing to enforce the zoning laws against the Shelter; Count II alleged that the Shelter was causing a nuisance to the Schnurbusches; Count III requested the court declare the validity of \u201camended zoning ordinance No. 4080\u201d; and Count IV alleged that the City failed to enforce its municipal code and ordinances against the Shelter, and requested punitive damages. Counts II and IV were dismissed by the trial court. Following trial on Counts I and III, the trial court entered its judgment in favor of the City and the Shelter on both counts. \n \nThe Schnurbusches appealed. This Court affirmed the judgment by a Memorandum Decision, and mandate was issued on January 23, 2012. Schnurbusch v. City of West Plains Missouri, SD31107 (Schnurbusch I). \n \nOn January 17, 2012, the Schnurbusches filed a pro se four-count petition in Howell County against the Shelter in Case No. 12AL-CC00006. 1 The petition contained similar allegations to those put forward in Schnurbusch I. \n \nOn February 24, 2012, the Shelter filed its answer to the Schnurbusches' petition, and included a three-count counterclaim against the Schnurbusches and the Corporation. 2 \n \nOn May 1, 2012, the Schnurbusches and the Corporation filed motions to dismiss the Shelter's counterclaims. The trial court denied these motions. \n \nThe Shelter filed a motion to dismiss the Schnurbusches' petition for failure to state a claim on June 15, 2012. The trial court granted the motion. The case then proceeded on the Shelter's counterclaims. \n \nThe Schnurbusches filed a pro se motion for summary judgment on September 3, 2013. On September 13, 2013, the Shelter filed a motion for sanctions against the Schnurbusches and the Corporation for failure to comply with a discovery order. After a hearing, the trial court granted the Shelter's motion for sanctions and struck the Schnurbusches' motion for summary judgment. \n \nOn December 23, 2014, the Schnurbusches filed their \u201cResubmitted Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d The Shelter filed its \u201cCross Motion for Summary Judgment\u201d against the Schnurbusches and the Corporation on February 17, 2015. On March 19, 2015, the Corporation, through counsel, 3 filed its response and memorandum of law in opposition to the Shelter's cross motion for summary judgment. On the same day, the Schnurbusches filed a response to the Shelter's cross motion for summary judgment. \n \nOn September 21, 2015, the Shelter filed a \u201cSecond Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\u201d against the Corporation, to which the Corporation filed no response. \n \nOn October 19, 2015, the trial court entered judgment denying the Schnurbusches' resubmitted motion for summary judgment; sustained the Shelter's cross motion for summary judgment against the Schnurbusches on Count I of its counterclaim on the issue of liability, and reserved ruling on the issue of damages for a later date; sustained the Shelter's motion for summary judgment as to Count II of its counterclaim against the Schnurbusches and entered judgment in the amount of $15,268.75 plus costs; and denied the Shelter's motion for summary judgment against the Corporation. \n \nOn November 2, 2015, the Shelter voluntarily dismissed, without prejudice, Count III of its counterclaim. \n \nOn November 3, 2015, after a hearing, the trial court entered its \u201cFinal Judgment\u201d as to the Shelter's second motion for partial summary judgment against the Corporation, and awarded damages to the Shelter on Counts I and II of its counterclaim. The trial court found the Corporation to be in default for failure to file any responsive pleading to the Shelter's second motion for partial summary judgment. The trial court also found as to Count I of the Shelter's counterclaim, that the Shelter had incurred damages in the form of attorney fees in the amount of $45,112.50 in defense of the lawsuit in Case No. 09PU-CV00849, and entered judgment for that amount against the Schnurbusches and the Corporation, jointly and severally. As to Count II of the Shelter's counterclaim, the trial court incorporated its findings and conclusions set forth in its prior judgment of October 19, 2015, and entered judgment in the amount of $15,268.75 plus costs against the Schnurbusches. The trial court accepted the Shelter's voluntary dismissal of Count III of its counterclaim. \n \nOn February 25, 2016, the Schnurbusches filed a timely Notice of Appeal asserting twelve points of trial court error. 4 As eleven of the twelve points fail to present issues for our appeal, we do not recite the substance of their contentions here. 5 Point VII comes the closest to compliance, and its defects do not impede our review. For that reason, we review Point VII ex gratia. \n \nPoint VII reads: \n \nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN SUSTAINING A MOTION FOR THE DISMISSAL OF THE PETITION WHICH WAS FILED BY THE PLAINTIFFS ON JANUARY 17, 2012 IN CASE 12AL-CC00006, WILLARD SCHNURBUSCH AND CAROL SCHNURBUSCH, AS HUSBAND AND WIFE ONLY AND ACTING PRO SE, BECAUSE THEIR PETITION. ON ITS FACE DID IN FACT, PLEAD SUFFICIENT FACTS, ALLOWED BY LAW TO PERMIT THE PLAINTIFFS TO PROCEED ON WITH THEIR FILED ACTION AND ALSO THE MOTION TO DISMISS FILED BY WEST PLAINS REGIONAL ANIMAL SHELTER THROUGH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, GEORGE CHRYSLER FISHER, JR. ON JUNE 15, 2012 INCLUDED MATTERS OUTSIDE THE PLEADINGS AND THEREFORE THE COURT WAS REQUIRED BY RULE 55.27 (a), TO HAVE TREATED THE MOTION TO DISMISS FILED ON JUNE 15,2012 AS A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, THEREFORE AN ENTRY OF SUSTAINING THE MOTION DISMISS WAS ERROR BY THE TRIAL COURT[.] \n \nStandard of Review \n \nThe trial court is authorized to rule on a motion for summary judgment \u201c[a]fter the response, reply and any sur-reply have been filed or the deadlines therfor have expired[.]\u201d Rule 74.04(c)(6). The trial court shall enter summary judgment only when the applicable pleadings \u201cshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[.]\u201d Id. \n \nOur review of the trial court's entry of summary judgment is de novo. ITT Commercial Fin. Corp. v. Mid-Am. Marine Supply Corp., 854 S.W.2d 371, 376 (Mo. banc 1993). We review the record in the light most favorable to the party against whom judgment was entered. Id. \n \nAs Rule 74.04 makes clear, each factual statement is what is to be admitted or controverted\u2014the exhibits, affidavits and other attachments are merely support to show that there is a prima facie lack of genuine issue as to each stated fact: the statement shall state with particularity in separately numbered paragraphs each material fact as to which movant claims there is no genuine issue, with specific references to the pleadings, discovery, exhibits or affidavits that demonstrate the lack of a genuine issue as to such facts. We accept as true facts set out by pleadings, exhibits, affidavits, and other supporting materials unless those facts are effectively controverted by non-movant, but only where the contents (or the foundation for admission) of these supporting materials are properly set out as facts pursuant to the requirements of Rule 74.04. \n \nMetro. Nat'l Bank v. Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co., 456 S.W.3d 61, 67\u201368 (Mo.App. S.D. 2015) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \n \nAnalysis \n \nPoint VII argues that the trial court erred in granting the Shelter's motion to dismiss the Schnurbusches' petition in that the trial court inappropriately considered matters outside the record, and thereby transformed the motion into one for summary judgment. \n \nRule 55.27(a)(11)(B) allows trial courts to treat a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim as a motion for summary judgment when the moving party includes matters outside the petition for the court's consideration. While the language of Rule 55.27(a)(11)(B) limits this \u201cconversion\u201d to motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, our courts have interpreted this rule to allow the conversion of a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment when the motion to dismiss is based on an affirmative defense. See e.g., Dwyer v. Meramec Venture Assocs., L.L.C., 75 S.W.3d 291, 292 n.1 (Mo.App. E.D. 2002); Snelling v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 996 S.W.2d 601, 604 (Mo.App. E.D. 1999). \n \nWhen the trial court, as here, converts a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must compel adherence to the mandatory dictates of Rule 74.04. The Western District of this Court recently examined this issue in Energy Creates Energy, LLC v. Heritage Group, __S.W.3d__, *3-4, 2016 WL 6694972 (Mo.App. W.D. Nov. 15, 2016): \n \nRule 74.04(c)(1) sets forth the requirements for filing a motion for summary judgment which includes: (1) the filing of a statement of uncontroverted facts stated with particularity and in numbered paragraphs, (2) the attachment of a copy of all discovery, exhibits or affidavits on which the motion relies, and (3) the filing of a separate legal memorandum explaining why summary judgment should be granted. The rule further requires a response, to be filed within thirty days, that sets forth each statement of fact in its original paragraph number and immediately thereunder admit or deny each of movant's factual statements. The rule prohibits a denial from resting upon the mere allegations or denials of the party's pleading but rather requires the response to support each denial with specific references to the discovery, exhibits or affidavits that demonstrate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. The respondent is also allowed to set forth additional material facts that remain in dispute. \n \nThese procedural requirements are not to be taken as idle suggestions. The underlying purpose of Rule 74.04 is directed toward helping the court expedite the disposition of the case. Because of this fact, compliance with the rule is mandatory. Summary judgment is based on the underlying predicate that, where the facts are not in dispute, a prevailing party can be determined as a matter of law. The procedures of Rule 74.04 were developed to establish a step-by-step method by which such cases can be identified and resolved. The failure of the parties to adhere to the text of the rule robs it of its usefulness. It is not the function of the circuit court or appellate court to sift through a voluminous record in an attempt to determine the basis for the motion. Rather, a motion for summary judgment is required to follow a specific format in order to clarify the areas of dispute and eliminate the need for the trial or appellate court to sift through the record to identify factual disputes. Such rationale is equally applicable to a motion to dismiss that has been converted to a motion for summary judgment. \n \nId. at *3\u20134 (internal quotations and citations omitted) (internal footnote omitted). We agree with the well-reasoned analysis of the Western District\u2014a motion to dismiss, converted by the trial court into a motion for summary judgment, must comply with the procedural strictures of Rule 74.04. 6 \n \nHere, the Shelter filed its motion to dismiss the Schnurbusches' third amended petition on June 15, 2012, arguing that the petition \u201cfail[ed] to state a claim in that said suit violates the doctrine of res judicata, the rule against splitting causes of action[,] and collateral estoppel[.]\u201d The motion relied on extrinsic materials, as admitted by the Shelter, which were attached to the motion to dismiss as exhibits; namely, the Schnurbusches' third amended petition from Case No. 09PU-CV00849, the judgment from the same case, and the memorandum decision of this Court in Schnurbusch I. \n \nThe trial court, by relying on these extrinsic materials in granting the Shelter's motion to dismiss on November 26, 2012, transformed the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. However, the record does not reflect that the trial court compelled the parties to comply with the procedural strictures of Rule 74.04, as Rule 55.27(a) requires. For instance, there is no statement of uncontroverted material facts, nor is there a separate legal memorandum explaining why summary judgment should be granted. It is also not clear whether the Schnurbusches were granted the opportunity to set forth additional material facts that remained in dispute. The record does not demonstrate the \u201cstep-by-step\u201d method by which cases are to be resolved in summary judgment. ITT Commercial Finance Corp., 854 S.W.2d at 376. \n \nThe trial court considered matters outside the pleadings in evaluating the Shelter's motion to dismiss, and there is no proper Rule 74.04 record for our review on appeal. As a result, we reverse and remand the trial court's judgment granting Shelter's motion to dismiss the Schnurbusches' petition for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The trial court's judgment is affirmed in all other respects. \n \nFOOTNOTES \n \n1 .  \u2003The Corporation was subsequently added as a party. \n \n2 .  \u2003Count I of the Shelter's counterclaim was against the Schnurbusches and the Corporation for malicious prosecution in filing a second cause of action; Count II was against the Schnurbusches for malicious prosecution as the claims set forth in the current action were fully adjudicated in Case No. 09PU-CV00849; and Count III was against the Schnurbusches and the Corporation for punitive damages. \n \n3 .  \u2003Counsel for the Corporation withdrew from representation on September 22, 2015. \n \n4 .  \u2003The Schnurbusches appeal only that part of the judgment against the Schnurbusches, and not that part of the judgment against the Corporation. \n \n5 .  \u2003The Rule 84.04 defects in all the Schnurbusches' points, with the exception of Point VII, are so severe that they inhibit our ability to review them. The Schnurbusches' statement of facts does not contain a \u201cfair and concise statement of the facts relevant to the questions presented for determination without argument.\u201d Rule 84.04(c). The purpose of Rule 84.04(c) is to define the scope of the controversy and afford the reviewing court an immediate, accurate, complete, and unbiased understanding of the facts of the case. Carden v. City of Rolla, 290 S.W.3d 728, 730 (Mo.App. S.D. 2009).The Schnurbusches' brief also wholly fails to set forth points relied on that comply with Rule 84.04(d)(1), which requires that each point:(A) identify the trial court ruling or action that the appellant challenges;(B) state concisely the legal reasons for the appellant's claim of reversible error; and(C) explain in summary fashion why, in the context of the case, those legal reasons support the claim of reversible error.The point shall be in substantially the following form: \u201cThe trial court erred in [identify the challenged ruling or action], because [state the legal reasons for the claim of reversible error], in that [explain why the legal reasons, in the context of the case, support the claim of reversible error].\u201d(Emphasis and brackets in original).Further, the Schnurbusches' Points V, X, XI and XII are multifarious in that they raise multiple legal issues and claims of trial court error. See Law Offices of Gary Green, P.C. v. Morrissey, 210 S.W.3d 421, 424 (Mo.App. S.D. 2006). The Schnurbusches also fail to provide the applicable standard of review, as required by Rule 84.04(e), for Points III, IV, VIII, IX, XI, and XII. In other points, the Schnurbusches recite standards of review that are inapplicable to the point relied on.The Schnurbusches' statement of facts substantially relies upon documents inserted into the record on appeal that are not properly before this Court. The Schnurbusches devote substantial portions of their statement of facts discussing non-appealable rulings and orders issued by the trial court. Further, the statement of facts provides a conclusory and argumentative discussion of the facts.\u201cA failure to substantially comply with Rule 84.04 preserves nothing for appellate review.\u201d Bieri v.

WD 78998      Decided: January 10, 2017  Before Division Three: \u2009Alok Ahuja, P.J., Victor C. Howard, and James Edward Welsh, JJ. \nJoseph Simmons appeals the circuit court's judgment following a jury trial convicting him of first-degree statutory sodomy. We affirm. \n \nBackground \n \nIn November 2014, the State charged Simmons with first-degree statutory sodomy (§\u2002566.062, RSMo\u2009 1 ) for subjecting his five-year-old great-granddaughter (\u201cVictim\u201d\u2009 2 ) to deviate sexual intercourse during the time period of August 2013\u2013August 2014. \n \nThe case was tried before a jury in April of 2015. The State's witnesses were the Victim and her brother, mother, father, and stepmother, an officer who investigated the case, and a Child Advocacy Center interviewer. Simmons' witnesses consisted of two of his daughters (including the Victim's grandmother), a granddaughter, his medical doctor, and himself. \n \nViewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, 3 the evidence showed that, during the period in question, Victim was four and five years old, having turned five in September of 2013. At that time, Victim was in the custody of her grandmother (\u201cGrandmother\u201d), who is Simmons' daughter and the mother of Victim's father. The evidence further showed that, although Grandmother had custody of Victim, Victim slept next door at Simmons' house. \n \nIn July 2014, Victim's father (\u201cFather\u201d) and stepmother (\u201cStepmother\u201d) regained custody of Victim. 4 They soon discovered that Victim was \u201ctouching other people inappropriately\u201d and \u201cdoing things to other children,\u201d including at school. She was \u201calways looking through the bathroom\u201d trying to \u201ccatch the boys when they were in the shower without any clothes on\u201d and \u201cdoing a lot of kissing\u201d of boys. She reportedly had kissed multiple male cousins (sometimes with her tongue out), including one with whom \u201cshe [tried] to get under the [bedroom] covers.\u201d When Father asked Victim about her actions, her answer revealed the abuse by Simmons. \n \nVictim told Father, in the presence of Stepmother, that \u201cshe had popped a pimple and played with his balls, my grandpa,\u201d referring to Simmons. Victim also told Stepmother that \u201cbad things had happened to her\u201d with Simmons, \u201cthat she would have to rub his balls and sometimes his wiener\u201d and that they would \u201cpop the pimple.\u201d Victim explained, in response to Stepmother's quizzical expression, \u201c[y]ou know, that white/yellow stuff sometimes that comes out.\u201d \n \nFather and Stepmother contacted the Sheriff's Department. According to Sergeant Tony Kirkendoll, Father called the department and stated that Victim \u201chad said some things to him and [Stepmother] that were alarming to him.\u201d Kirkendoll and another officer went to Father's home to investigate, and Father and Stepmother related Victim's allegations about Simmons. After hearing the allegations, the officers arranged for Victim and her older brother (\u201cBrother\u201d) to be interviewed at the Children's Advocacy Center (\u201cCAC\u201d). \n \nAfter the officers left, Stepmother called Victim's mother (\u201cMother\u201d) to tell her what Victim had told them. Mother testified that, when she later talked to Victim about the matter, Victim told her the same things that she had told Father, using the same explicit language. Victim told Mother that she had not mentioned the incidents because she did not want Mother to be mad at her. Mother told the jury that Simmons \u201cdefinitely\u201d showed favoritism toward Victim, in that he gave her gifts and money, and she was \u201cnever really allowed to get in trouble, per se.\u201d \n \nAt her CAC interview, Victim disclosed that \u201cevery day and every night\u201d (specifically, every day when she woke up) Simmons forced her to rub his \u201cwiener\u201d and/or \u201cnuts\u201d (genitalia) with her hands and \u201cpop the pimple,\u201d which caused \u201cwhite stuff\u201d to come out in the shape of a \u201crainbow.\u201d She said that Simmons made her wipe the white stuff on her pants. The interviewer testified that she believed Victim \u201cwas talking about ejaculation.\u201d Victim demonstrated to the interviewer how Simmons' sex organs would change shape when she rubbed him. Victim described Simmons' \u201cnuts\u201d as looking and feeling like a ball of water. She also stated that she had to touch Simmons' genitals with a towel and \u201cwiggle it around.\u201d Victim told the interviewer that Simmons tried to touch her genitals and \u201cbutt\u201d and tried to put something long, pink, and plastic in her \u201cbutt.\u201d Victim said that, when Simmons gave her a bath, he would touch her \u201cbad spot\u201d (her genital area) with his hand during the bath and while drying her off. Victim also stated that Simmons had threatened to shoot her or call the police and have her put in jail if she refused to perform these sex acts. \n \nVictim testified at trial about the sexual abuse. The prosecution asked Victim what would happen in Simmons' room, and she responded, \u201cHe would make me rub his wiener,\u201d his \u201cbad spot.\u201d She stated that this happened \u201cevery day and every night,\u201d and that, when she told Simmons that she did not want to do these things, he responded, \u201cget over here or I'll give you the belt.\u201d Victim testified that, when Simmons gave her baths, he \u201cwould touch my bad spot.\u201d \n \nBrother was seven years old when he spoke with the CAC interviewer. He stated that he slept at Simmons' house in an adjacent bedroom (which was supposed to be Victim's room), while Victim slept in Simmons' bed. Brother told the interviewer that, one night (not long before the interview) he was standing in the doorway of Simmons' bedroom and saw Simmons touch Victim's \u201cbad spot\u201d with his hand. Brother said that he told Father about this incident after Victim had been trying to kiss her male cousins. He also told the interviewer that he did not feel safe around Simmons, whom he described as \u201cjust mean.\u201d Video recordings of both children's interviews were played for the jury at trial. \n \nBrother also testified at trial about seeing Simmons touch Victim's \u201cbad spot,\u201d and he demonstrated Simmons' actions to the jury. Brother told the jury that he saw Simmons standing beside the bed where victim was sleeping and that Simmons pulled down Victim's pajama pants, touched her vaginal area over her underwear, and then went into the bathroom. Brother testified that Victim usually slept in Simmons' bed and that Simmons would carry Victim into his bed when she fell asleep elsewhere in the house. \n \nFollowing the children's CAC interviews, the Sheriff's Department contacted Simmons. Simmons waived his Miranda rights and agreed to give a statement to law enforcement officers, including Sergeant Kirkendoll. At the interview, Simmons acknowledged that he was \u201cpartial\u201d to Victim and that she \u201coftentimes\u201d slept in the same bed with him. Simmons admitted that Victim had complained to him when he accidentally touched her while giving her a bath, and she said \u201cthat was a bad spot, or not to touch her there.\u201d He claimed that it never happened again. Simmons told the officer that \u201che'd never known [Victim] to lie,\u201d but he denied the remainder of the alleged acts. \n \nAt trial, Simmons testified that he favored Victim over all of his 25 great-grandchildren. He said that he \u201ctook [her]\u201d as his \u201cpet\u201d and \u201cspoiled her rotten.\u201d Simmons also admitted that Victim slept in his bed. He stated that he only touched Victim's vagina by accident when drying her \u201csides\u201d after a bath, and that, after Victim complained, he always let her dry herself. Simmons claimed to have been impotent for years, but he \u201c[did]n't really remember\u201d when he became impotent. 5 Simmons acknowledged that, in 1976 (when he was around thirty years old), he had been convicted of the statutory rape of a fourteen-year-old girl. \n \nThe defense theory at trial was that the parents had put Victim and Brother up to lying about Simmons to aid in their custody battle against Grandmother. Among Simmons' witnesses was a daughter (whom we refer to as \u201cAunt\u201d), who testified that she had had three conversations with Father (her nephew) following Victim's disclosure of the abuse. Counsel then asked, \u201cCould you tell the court the substance of those conversations?\u201d The State objected on the basis that the question \u201ccalls for hearsay,\u201d and the court sustained the objection. \n \nThe jury found Simmons guilty, and the court sentenced him, as a prior offender, to twenty years' imprisonment. \n \nDiscussion \n \nBoth of Simmons' points on appeal relate to the court's exclusion of Aunt's testimony about her conversations with Father regarding Victim's allegations. \u201cA trial court has broad discretion to admit or exclude evidence,\u201d and we will reverse its decision only for a clear abuse of discretion. State v. Forrest, 183 S.W.3d 218, 223 (Mo. banc 2006). A court abuses its discretion when its ruling \u201cis clearly against the logic of the circumstances and so unreasonable as to indicate a lack of careful consideration.\u201d Id. \n \nSimmons claims in Point I that the court erred in excluding Aunt's testimony under the rule to exclude witnesses from the courtroom (\u201cthe rule\u201d), in that Father could have been recalled to rebut Aunt's statements. Simmons asserts that, although Father had remained in the courtroom after being excused as a witness, he was not \u201cincompetent to testify\u201d in rebuttal because, even if Father violated the rule, there was no \u201cconsent, connivance, or procurement of the party or counsel calling him.\u201d \n \nUnder the rule, a court may order witnesses excluded from the courtroom so that they will not be privy to the testimony of other witnesses. State v. Clinch, 335 S.W.3d 579, 589 (Mo. App. W.D.2011). \u201cThe remedy \u2024 for violation of \u2018the rule\u2019 is to disqualify the offending witness from testifying.\u201d Id. Whether to exclude testimony because a witness violated the rule lies within the sound discretion of the circuit court. Id. \n \nHere, the record shows that the court sustained the State's objection to this line of questioning on the basis that the testimony would be hearsay, not based on a violation of the rule. After defense counsel asked Aunt, \u201cCould you tell the court the substance of those conversations [with Father]?\u201d and the State objected on the basis of \u201chearsay,\u201d defense counsel responded only that \u201c[Father] is available.\u201d The court ruled: \u2009\u201cCounsel, I don't know. You're asking her to testify what he said? We'll pass on that. I'm going to have to sustain the objection, if that's what the question is \u2024 eliciting [.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) After the court sustained the objection, defense counsel clarified that he was stating that Father was available, and the court stated: \u2009\u201cWell, it is still the statement of a\u2014of a person who is not a party or victim in this proceeding that's apparently being offered for the truth of its contents, correct?\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defense counsel did not reply to the court's inquiry but, instead, stated: \u2009\u201cJudge, if you're sustaining the state's objection\u2014[to which the court interjected, \u201cI am\u201d]\u2014we'll move on.\u201d Counsel stated that he had \u201cnothing further for this witness,\u201d and Aunt was excused. \n \nAfter Aunt stepped down, and after an unrelated bench conference about Simmons' prior rape conviction, defense counsel asked \u201cto proffer what [Aunt's] testimony would be.\u201d He stated that \u201cshe was going to testify that [Father] admitted to her that he was lying about [Victim's] allegations, made statements to that effect.\u201d The court responded, \u201cWell, I don't think that's the correct way to make a proffer of evidence, but you've made your record. So we'll move on.\u201d\u2009 6 \n \nSimmons is correct that a court should disqualify the offending witness from testifying only where \u201cthe witness violated the rule with \u2018the consent, connivance or procurement of the party or counsel calling him.\u2019\u2009\u201d Clinch, 335 S.W.3d at 589. It could be argued that such was the case here, given that defense counsel obviously knew he would be asking Aunt about Father's alleged statements and that Father remained in the courtroom. We need not address that issue, however, because the record shows that the court never actually applied \u201cthe rule\u201d to exclude Father's testimony, in that Simmons never attempted to re-call Father as a witness. \n \nPoint I is denied. \n \nSimmons contends in Point II that the circuit court erred in excluding Aunt's testimony on the basis that her statements would be hearsay. He argues that the proposed testimony was not hearsay but was admissible to impeach Father's credibility, in that Father had testified that Victim voluntarily disclosed her allegations of abuse to him, but Aunt would testify \u201cthat Father had told her [that Victim] had not done so and, instead, that the allegations came from Mother.\u201d \n \n\u201cA hearsay statement is any out-of-court statement that is used to prove the truth of the matter asserted and that depends upon the veracity of the statement for its value.\u201d State v. Winfrey, 337 S.W.3d 1, 6 (Mo. banc 2011). \u201cSuch statements are generally inadmissible unless they fall within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d Id. A statement is not hearsay when it is offered not to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but for some other purpose that does not require a belief in its truthfulness, such as impeachment. See id. at 6\u20137. Here, Simmons argues that Aunt's proposed testimony was not hearsay because it was being offered to show that Father made a statement to Aunt that was \u201cinconsistent with [his] testimony\u201d and, thus, was admissible as impeachment, in that it had a \u201clegitimate tendency to throw light on [Father's] \u2018accuracy, truthfulness, and sincerity.\u2019\u2009\u201d See State v. Hahn, 37 S.W.3d 344, 355 (Mo. App. W.D.2000). \n \nThe problem with this argument is that no foundation was laid for impeachment of Father with a prior inconsistent statement. \u201cA witness may be impeached by extrinsic proof of a prior inconsistent statement as to material matters\u201d provided that a proper foundation has been laid. Aliff v. Cody, 26 S.W.3d 309, 318 (Mo. App. W.D.2000). A proper foundation requires that Father be confronted with the alleged statements during his examination. See id. at 317\u201318. \u201cIn laying the proper foundation, it is necessary to ask the witness whether he or she made the statement, quote the statement, and point out the precise circumstances under which it was allegedly made, including to whom the witness spoke and the time and place of the statement.\u201d Id. at 318. If Father admits that he made the statement, then that concludes the matter; \u2009if Father denies or equivocates, then Aunt may testify concerning the statement she attributes to Father. See State v. Wilson, 105 S.W.3d 576, 585 (Mo. App. S.D.2003). The exclusion of testimony that is intended solely for impeachment purposes is \u201cnot fundamentally unfair\u201d if the appellant had the opportunity to thoroughly cross-examine the witness whose testimony was to be impeached. See State v. Woods, 357 S.W.3d 249, 254 (Mo. App. W.D.2012). Here, Father was cross-examined by Simmons' defense counsel but was not asked about his alleged statements to Aunt. Consequently, no impeachment by prior inconsistent statement was permissible. Moreover, Father was excused by the court after his testimony, and, as noted supra, no one sought to recall him to lay the proper foundation. \n \nIn addition, Simmons did not raise impeachment at trial as a basis for admitting Aunt's testimony. 7 Defense counsel's only response to the State's hearsay objection was that \u201c[Father] is available.\u201d Simmons did not claim at any time prior to the court's final ruling on that objection that he was offering the testimony for impeachment purposes. Furthermore, Simmons' proffer at trial as to what Aunt would have said is different from what Simmons claims on appeal that she would have said, i.e., that Father stated Victim \u201chad not [disclosed her allegations to him] and, instead, the allegations came from Mother.\u201d\u2009 8 \u201cAn argument is not properly preserved for appeal when the Appellant fails to argue at trial the grounds asserted upon appeal.\u201d State v. Dismang, 151 S.W.3d 155, 162 (Mo. App. S.D.2004). \u201cAn appellant cannot broaden or change allegations of error on appeal.\u201d Id. Simmons attempts to do just that; \u2009thus, this claim is not preserved and is subject to review for plain error only. See id. \n \nRule 30.20 authorizes this Court to review, in its discretion, \u201cplain errors affecting substantial rights \u2024 when the court finds that manifest injustice or miscarriage of justice has resulted therefrom.\u201d Our Supreme Court has established a threshold review to determine if a court should exercise its discretion to entertain a Rule 30.20 review of a claimed plain error. First, we determine whether or not the claimed error \u201cfacially establishes substantial grounds for believing that \u2018manifest injustice or miscarriage of justice has resulted[.]\u2019\u2009\u201d State v. Brown, 902 S.W.2d 278, 284 (Mo. banc 1995) (quoting Rule 30.20). If not, we should not exercise our discretion to conduct a Rule 30.20 plain error review. Id. If, however, we conclude that we have passed this threshold, we may proceed to review the claim under a two-step process pursuant to Rule 30.20. In the first step, we decide whether plain error has, in fact, occurred. State v. Baumruk, 280 S.W.3d 600, 607 (Mo. banc 2009). \u201cAll prejudicial error, however, is not plain error, and plain errors are those which are evident, obvious, and clear.\u201d Id. In the absence of evident, obvious, and clear error, we should not proceed further with our plain error review. If, however, we find plain error, we must continue to the second step to consider whether or not a miscarriage of justice or manifest injustice will occur if the error is left uncorrected. Id. \n \n\u201cManifest injustice is determined by the facts and circumstances of the case, and the defendant bears the burden of establishing manifest injustice.\u201d State v. Baxter, 204 S.W.3d 650, 652 (Mo. banc 2006). Here, Simmons fails to show that his claim meets the initial threshold test. It does not facially establish substantial grounds for believing that he has suffered a manifest injustice; \u2009thus, we need not proceed with any Rule 30.20 plain error review. \n \nPoint II is denied. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe circuit court did not sustain the State's objection to Aunt's testimony based on the rule to exclude witnesses, and Simmons failed to lay a proper foundation for his claim that the testimony was admissible for impeachment purposes. Thus, we affirm the circuit court's judgment. \n \nFOOTNOTES \n \n1 .  \u2003Statutory references are to the Revised Statutes of Missouri (RSMo) 2000, as updated by the 2013 Cumulative Supplement. \n \n2 .  \u2003We do not use the names of the children or related parties (except for the Appellant) in order to protect the children's identities.

Woods, 357 S.W.3d 249, 253 (Mo. App. W.D.2012). \u201cThe offer must be definite, specific, and demonstrate why the evidence is relevant and admissible. Mere statements and conclusions of counsel are not sufficient.\u201d State v. Comte, 141 S.W.3d 89, 93 (Mo. App. S.D.2004). \n \n7 .  \u2003Simmons also has not claimed, at trial or on appeal, that the evidence was admissible under section 491.074, under which \u201ca prior inconsistent statement of any witness testifying in the trial of a criminal offense shall be received as substantive evidence.\u201d Offering a prior inconsistent statement only to impeach a witness does not preserve a claim that the statement was admissible as substantive evidence under that statute. See State v. Proudie, 493 S.W.3d 6, 12 (Mo. App. E.D.2016). \n \n8 .  \u2003This language appears to be derived from Aunt's affidavit (which was submitted post trial as an attachment to Simmons' new trial motion), in which she claims, inter alia, that Father told her \u201cthat he had nothing to do with the allegations of abuse and that they had come from [Mother].\u201d \n \nJames Edward Welsh, Judge \n \nAll concur.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"State of Missouri, Respondent, v.

WD 79520      Decided: January 24, 2017  Before Division Two: \u2009Lisa White Hardwick, Presiding Judge, Gary Witt, Judge, Anthony Rex Gabbert, Judge \nAmerican Standard Insurance Company of Wisconsin (American Standard) appeals the circuit court's grant of summary judgment to Truman Medical Center, Inc. (Truman Medical) on Truman Medical's First Amended Petition to Enforce Hospital's Lien Pursuant to Section 430.250, RSMo. 2000. American Standard argues that the court erred in granting a judgment enforcing the lien because the lien was not a valid and enforceable lien under Section 430.240, RSMo Cum. Supp. 2013, because the lien notice failed to include the name of the person alleged to be liable to the injured person and, further, Truman Medical failed to perfect the alleged hospital lien by supplementing the lien notice once the identity of the person alleged to be liable to the injured person became known. We affirm. \n \nThere is no dispute regarding the underlying facts. On November 19, 2013, Charles Fanning was involved in an automobile accident with a driver insured by American Standard. Fanning received treatment at Truman Medical for injuries he sustained as a result of the accident. He had outstanding medical bills in the amount of $4,347.02 arising out of that treatment. Fanning claimed that the injuries sustained and the resulting damages were caused by the negligence of American Standard's insured driver. \n \nOn the day of the accident, Fanning was interviewed by an agent of Truman Medical. Fanning advised the agent about his claim with American Standard, including the claim number, but he could not recall the name of the woman who collided with his vehicle, only saying \u201ca lady\u201d ran a stop sign. Truman Medical's attorney contacted American Standard on behalf of Truman Medical to verify the claim information prior to sending the hospital lien notice. There was apparently no discussion regarding the name of the \u201clady\u201d who had insurance liability coverage through American Standard. On November 25, 2013, Truman Medical sent a written lien notice to American Standard regarding treatment it provided to Fanning for injuries sustained in the accident. The notice stated that the \u201cname of the person or persons, firm or firms, corporation or corporations alleged to be liable to Charles Ray Fanning for the injuries received is unknown.\u201d No party disputes that Truman Medical was actually unaware at the time the lien notice was sent of the name of the woman alleged to have caused Fanning's injuries. \n \nAmerican Standard received Truman Medical's lien notice and matched it to the correct claim file. Fanning's attorney wrote to American Standard on April 22, 2014, making an offer to settle Fanning's claim for $25,000.00, citing the treatment at Truman Medical as related to the accident. American Standard considered Fanning's medical bills from Truman Medical in evaluating Fanning's claim and when making an offer of settlement to Fanning. American Standard had a discussion with Fanning's attorney regarding the validity of Truman Medical's lien, and decided not to pay the lien because American Standard did not believe the lien to be valid. On or about June 20, 2014, American Standard settled Fanning's claim for $25,000.00. No portion of the settlement was paid by American Standard to Truman Medical for the medical services rendered to Fanning stemming from the accident associated with the settlement. \n \nTruman Medical filed suit pursuant to Section 430.250 to enforce its lien. American Standard refused to honor the lien contending that the lien was invalid pursuant to Section 430.250. American Standard argued that Section 430.250 provides that a lien is only valid if the requirements of Section 430.240 are complied with, and Section 430.240 requires that the lien notice include the name of the tortfeasor alleged to be liable for the injuries the hospital provided services for; \u2009because Truman Medical's lien notice did not include the name of the lady whose collision with Fanning caused Fanning injuries, the lien was ineffective. Truman Medical disagreed and argued that Section 430.240 only requires designation of the tortfeasor if that person or entity was actually known at the time the lien notice was drafted. \n \nBoth Truman Medical and American Standard filed motions for summary judgment on stipulated facts. In its judgment the court indicated that the \u201csole legal question before this Court is the importance of the words \u2018if known\u2019 in R.S.Mo. §\u2002430.240.\u201d The court ultimately concluded: \n \nWhile the statute is confusing as written, this Court reads R.S.Mo. §\u2002430.240 to waive both the requirement to mail the lien notice of the allegedly liable party and the requirement to list the name of the allegedly liable party in the written notice. The inclusion of the phrase \u2018if known\u2019 recognizes that a hospital might have only partial information about a patient's accident. It seems the intent of the inclusion of the phrase \u2018if known\u2019 was to excuse a hospital from including this information that it didn't know or could not know. Courts should presume that the legislature intended that every word, clause, sentence, and provision of a statute have effect. Steven v. Residential Funding Corp., 334 S.W.3d 477, 498 (Mo. App. 2010). A hospital can only include information in a lien notice insofar as it has the information to include. \n \nThe circuit court granted Truman Medical's motion for summary judgment, denied American Standard's motion for summary judgment, and entered judgment in favor of Truman Medical and against American Standard in the amount of $4,346.02. American Standard appeals. \n \n\u201cThe propriety of summary judgment is purely an issue of law\u201d and, therefore, our review of a summary judgment is de novo. ITT Commercial Fin. Corp. v. Mid\u2013Am. Marine Supply Corp., 854 S.W.2d 371, 376 (Mo. banc 1993). We will affirm the circuit court's grant of summary judgment if no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id. at 381. \n \nWe review questions of statutory interpretation de novo. Ivie v. Smith, 439 S.W.3d 189, 202 (Mo. banc 2014). Our primary rule of statutory interpretation is to give effect to the legislative intent as reflected in the plain language of the statute at issue. Id. We will look beyond the plain meaning of the statute only when the language is ambiguous or would lead to an absurd or illogical result. Bateman v. Rinehart, 391 S.W.3d 441, 446 (Mo. banc 2013). \n \nA statute is ambiguous when its plain language does not answer the current dispute as to its meaning. Ambiguities in statutes are resolved by determining the intent of the legislature and by giving effect to its intent if possible. When determining the legislative intent of a statute, no portion of the statute is read in isolation, but rather the portions are read in context to harmonize all of the statute's provisions. Rules of statutory construction are used to resolve any ambiguities if the legislative intent is undeterminable from the plain meaning of the statutory language. \n \nBASF Corp. v. Dir. of Revenue, 392 S.W.3d 438, 444 (Mo. banc 2012) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \n \nIn its first point on appeal American Standard contends that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Truman Medical and against American Standard, and entering judgment against American Standard on Truman Medical's petition because Truman Medical did not have a valid and enforceable hospital lien under Section 430.240 in that it failed to include in the lien notice the name of the person alleged to be liable to the injured person. American Standard argues that the plain language of Section 430.240 requires notice by the hospital of the alleged tortfeasor. \n \nSection 430.230 provides, in relevant part: \n \nEvery public hospital or clinic, and every privately maintained hospital, clinic or other institution for the care of the sick, which is supported in whole or in part by charity, located within the state of Missouri \u2024 shall have a lien upon any and all claims, counterclaims, demands, suits, or rights of action of any person admitted to any hospital, clinic or other institution and receiving treatment, care or maintenance therein for any cause including any personal injury sustained by such person as the result of the negligence or wrongful act of another, which such injured person may have, assert or maintain against the person or persons causing such injury for damages on account of such injury, for the cost of such service, computed at reasonable rates not to exceed twenty-five dollars per day and the reasonable cost of necessary X\u2013ray, laboratory, operating room and medication service, as such hospital, clinic, or other institution shall render such injured person on account of his conditions \u2024 \n \nSection 430.240 states: \n \nNo such lien shall be effective, however, unless a written notice containing the name and address of the injured person, the date of the accident, the name and location of the hospital and the name of the person or persons, firm or firms, corporation or corporations alleged to be liable to the injured party for the injuries received shall be sent by certified mail with return receipt requested to the person or persons, firm or firms, corporation or corporations, if known, alleged to be liable to the injured party, if known, for the injuries sustained prior to the payment of any moneys to such injured person, his attorneys or legal representative, as compensation for such injuries. Such hospital shall send by certified mail with return receipt requested a copy of such notice to any insurance carrier, if known, which has insured such person, firm or corporation against such liability. \n \nSection 430.250 provides: \n \nAny person or persons, firm or firms, corporation or corporations, including an insurance carrier, making any payment to such patient or to his attorneys or heirs or legal representatives as compensation for the injury sustained, after the receipt of such notice in accordance with the requirements of section 430.240, without paying to such hospital the amount of its lien \u2024 shall have a period of one year, after such settlement is made known to the hospital, from the date of payment to such patient or his heirs, attorneys or legal representatives, as aforesaid, be and remain liable to such hospital for the amount which such hospital was entitled to receive, as aforesaid, and any such association, corporation or other institution maintaining such hospital may, within such period, enforce its lien by a suit at law against such person or persons, firm or firms, corporation or corporations making any such payment. \n \nTruman Medical agrees with American Standard that \u201ca very precise and technical reading of Section 430.240, using the rules of the English language\u201d requires the name of the tortfeasor in the lien notice, but argues that a review of the entire statute in accord with its purpose reveals that this interpretation leads to absurd and illogical results. Truman Medical argues that this interpretation is illogical when construed with the mailing portion of the statute that clearly contemplates that the tortfeasor may be unknown. \n \nWe find that we need not decide the issue of whether Section 430.240 is internally inconsistent because, under a plain reading of the statute, Truman Medical complied with the notice requirements. \n \nThe rules of statutory interpretation are not intended to be applied haphazardly or indiscriminately to achieve a desired result. Instead, the canons of statutory interpretation are considerations made in a genuine effort to determine what the legislature intended. This Court's primary rule of statutory interpretation is to give effect to legislative intent as reflected in the plain language of the statute at issue. \n \nParktown Imports, Inc. v. Audi of Am., Inc., 278 S.W.3d 670, 672 (Mo. banc 2009). There can be no doubt that by including in Section 430.240 the requirement that the lien include \u201cthe name of the person or persons, firm or firms, corporation or corporations alleged to be liable to the injured party for the injuries received\u201d the legislature intended that the identity of those allegedly responsible be transmitted to the insurance company. \n \nThe statute uses the term \u201cname\u201d to express that the lien holder must \u201cidentify\u201d the responsible party. See, Webster's New Third International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 1501 (1993) (defining name as \u201ca word or sound \u2024 by which an individual or class of individuals is regularly known or designated;\u201d \u2009\u201ca distinctive and specific appellation;\u201d \u2009\u201cdesignation or identifying expression.\u201d). First, by providing the claim number, Truman Medical did, in fact, include the name of the allegedly responsible party because that information is contained in the claim file. The facts of this case clearly establish that the claim number was sufficient to identify the name of the alleged tortfeasor. American Standard was able to pull up the claim and accident information when contacted by Truman Medical before the filing of the lien notice. \n \nFurther, if we apply the accepted definition of \u201cname\u201d to be synonymous with \u201cidentity,\u201d Truman Medical clearly identified the allegedly responsible party by identifying her by the designation actually used by American Standard. If anything, the inclusion of the claims number better identified to American Standard the responsible party than had the lien notice included only a name. As noted above, American Standard was able to use the claim number provided by Truman Medical to access the claim prior to the filing of the lien notice. By being able to use the claim number to access the information necessary to speak with Truman Medical's attorney, American Standard itself demonstrated that the number itself was a sufficient identifying name. \n \nAmerican Standard suggests two hypothetical situations believed to demonstrate that due process is not served without naming the tortfeasor in a lien notice. First, American Standard argues that a motor vehicle insurance policy might be issued to a husband whose wife is expressly excluded under that policy due to a poor driving record. American Standard contends that, without the name of the tortfeasor, American Standard would not be able to determine if coverage existed for the accident and would have insufficient information to protect itself with respect to the claimed lien. First, as noted above, such cannot be the situation when a lien holder includes the claim number because it does sufficiently identify the tortfeasor in question. Further, the insurance carrier's responsibility to pay the hospital lien under Section 430.250 only attaches after the insurance company has already accepted liability and is settling the claim; \u2009at the point of settlement the insurance carrier has already made a determination as to coverage under a particular policy. The carrier ultimately settles a claim with a specified injured person for an injury caused on a particular date by one of its insureds. Having the name of the injured person and the particular date on which the injury occurred is sufficient information for the insurance company to make a determination as to the applicability of a hospital lien. \n \nIn its second hypothetical, American Standard argues that a tortfeasor might steal an insured's vehicle and become involved in an accident. Without the name of the tortfeasor, American Standard contends it would have no way of determining whether the accident involved American Standard's insured, a permissive driver, or if coverage is completely excluded. Again, this argument ignores the fact that the alleged tortfeasor was actually identified in this case as well as the realities of insurance coverage and claims. Our Supreme Court expressed in Dutton v. American Family Mutual Insurance Company, 454 S.W.3d 319, 324\u2013325 (Mo. banc 2015), that Section 303.190 \u201cconcerns not which individuals are covered by an owner's policy but, rather, what vehicles are covered by that policy.\u201d A typical automobile insurance policy insures a particular vehicle for the person named within the policy, as well as any other person whom that individual has given express or implied consent to use the vehicle. Thus, even in American Standard's hypothetical, American Standard would not settle with an injured party without first determining whether the policy covered the driver that caused the injury. This inquiry would take place regardless of whether a hospital submitting a lien notice supplied the name of the tortfeasor within that notice. Upon learning that the driver was not covered under the policy, American Standard would have no obligation to settle with the injured party for injuries sustained, and Section 430.250 would never be implicated. \n \nBecause, in this case, the alleged tortfeasor was identified in the lien notice by the inclusion of a claim number we need not decide whether Section 430.240's provision requiring the lien to include \u201cthe name of the person or persons, firm or firms, corporation or corporations alleged to be liable to the injured party for the injuries\u201d renders the statute internally inconsistent with the \u201cif known\u201d provisions of that section. Instead, we find that the inclusion of a claims number in the lien notice was sufficient to comply with the identification requirements of Section 430.240. The statute is clear that the notice must contain the name and address of the injured person, the date of the accident, the name of the hospital, and the name of the entity alleged to be liable to the injured party. By including the claim number, this notice complied with those requirements. Because Truman Medical's lien notice complied with Section 430.240, it was valid as against American Standard. Point one is denied. As point one is dispositive of this appeal, we need not address American Standard's contention that Truman Medical failed to perfect its hospital lien by supplementing the lien notice once the identity of the tortfeasor became known. \n \nThe circuit court did not err in granting a judgment enforcing Truman Medical's lien against American Standard because the lien was a valid and enforceable lien under Section 430.240 because the lien notice was directed to American Standard and identified the American Standard claim number which allowed for the identification of the tortfeasor. We affirm the circuit court's judgment. \n \nAnthony Rex Gabbert, Judge \n \nAll concur.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Insurance industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Truman Medical Center, Inc., Respondent, v.

WASHINGTON, Appellant, v. STATE OF MISSOURI, Respondent. \n WD 78789      Decided: January 17, 2017  Before Division IV: Mark D. Pfeiffer, Chief Judge, and Thomas H. Newton and Gary D. Witt, Judges \nProcedural Background \n \nAfter a jury trial, Washington was convicted of one count of the class C felony of stealing and one count of the class C felony of forgery. The court sentenced him as a prior and persistent offender to ten years' imprisonment on each count, with the sentences to run concurrently. His convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal in State v. Washington, 397 S.W.3d 458 (Mo. App. W.D. 2013). We issued our mandate on May 29, 2013. Washington's original pro se Rule 29.15 motion for post-conviction relief was received and stamped filed by the clerk of the circuit court on September 4, 2013. Appointed counsel thereafter filed an amended motion alleging that Washington was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel by trial counsel's failure to assert Washington's right to due process and to a speedy trial. \n \nOn January 16, 2015, an evidentiary hearing was held to consider the merits of the amended motion. The circuit court entered judgment, denying Washington's amended motion. The issue of the timeliness of Washington's pro se motion was not raised by the parties or addressed by the circuit court in its judgment. 1 \n \nWashington appeals. \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe Missouri Constitution vests the Missouri Supreme Court with the authority to establish rules relating to practice, procedure, and pleading for all courts. MO. CONST. art. V, § 5. \u201cWhen properly adopted, the rules of court are binding on courts, litigants, and counsel, and it is the court's duty to enforce them.\u201d Dorris v. State, 360 S.W.3d 260, 268 (Mo. banc 2012) (internal quotation omitted). Accordingly, the circuit court has the duty to enforce the mandatory time limits in the post-conviction rules, even if the State does not raise the timeliness issue before the circuit court. Id. \u201cThe State cannot waive [a] movant's noncompliance with the time limits in Rule [\u2009] 29.15 \u2024\u201d Id. \n \nRule 29.15(b) 2 provides that if a movant appeals the judgment or sentence sought to be vacated, set aside, or corrected, the movant's pro se motion \u201cshall be filed within 90 days after the date the mandate of the appellate court is issued affirming such judgment or sentence.\u201d Here, Washington appealed his convictions and sentences for stealing and forgery after a jury trial. This court handed down its mandate affirming the underlying judgment and sentence on May 29, 2013. Accordingly, Washington's Rule 29.15 motion was due on August 27, 2013. See Rule 29.15(b). Washington's motion was stamped filed by the clerk of the circuit court on September 4, 2013, eight days out of time. \n \nIf the movant's Rule 29.15 pro se motion is not timely filed, \u201cit must be dismissed, as neither the motion court nor this Court has any authority to address the merits of [movant's] post-conviction claims.\u201d Miller v. State, 386 S.W.3d 225, 227 (Mo. App. W.D. 2012) (internal quotation omitted). The time limit in Rule 29.15 \u201cserve[s] the legitimate end of avoiding delay in the processing of prisoner's claims and prevent the litigation of stale claims.\u201d Dorris, 360 S.W.3d at 269 (internal quotation omitted). If a post-conviction movant was not required to timely file, \u201cfinality would be undermined and scarce public resources will be expended to investigate vague and often illusory claims, followed by unwarranted courtroom hearings.\u201d Id. (internal quotation omitted). The \u201c[f]ailure to file a motion within the time provided by this Rule 29.15 shall constitute a complete waiver of any right to proceed under this Rule 29.15 and a complete waiver of any claim that could be raised in the motion filed pursuant to this Rule 29.15.\u201d See Rule 29.15(b). \n \n\u201cIn a motion filed pursuant to Rule 29.15, the movant must allege facts showing a basis for relief to entitle the movant to an evidentiary hearing.\u201d Dorris, 360 S.W.3d at 267. \u201cIn addition to proving his substantive claims, the movant must show he filed his motion within the time limits provided in the Rules.\u201d Id. The movant can meet the burden of alleging that he timely filed his motion by either: \n \n(1) timely filing the original pro se motion so that the time stamp on the file reflects that it is within the time limits proscribed in the Rule; (2) alleging and proving by a preponderance of the evidence in his motion that he falls within a recognized exception to the time limits; or (3) alleging and proving by a preponderance of the evidence in his amended motion that the court misfiled the [original pro se] motion. \n \nId. \n \nWashington first argues on appeal that his motion should be considered timely filed under the second method of proving timeliness. Washington asserts that he mailed his pro se motion before the ninety-day deadline, pointing to the date of the letters (August 21, 2013) he used to file his motion with the clerk of the circuit court. However, neither of his filing letters nor his original pro se Rule 29.15 motion reference any \u201crecognized exception to the time limits\u201d for filing his motion. Frankly, if we assume, arguendo, that Washington did mail his original pro se motion to the clerk of the circuit court on August 21, 2013\u2014a motion that was not due until August 27, 2013\u2014at the time of drafting the motion, Washington \u201ccould not have been aware of [the] fact [that his motion was untimely and he needed to allege and prove an exception to the time limits].\u201d Vogl v. State, 437 S.W.3d 218, 227 (Mo. banc 2014). Simply put, Washington's original pro se motion did not allege or purport to establish that Washington was entitled to file his motion outside the time limits required by Rule 29.15 due to a recognized exception to such time limits. \n \nInstead, what Washington essentially argues on appeal is that we should adopt the application of a \u201cmailbox rule,\u201d which would make the filing date of a Rule 29.15 motion the date the inmate delivers it to prison authorities for mailing, not the date it is actually received in the circuit clerk's office. \u201cThe appellate courts of this state have historically rejected applying the mailbox rule to the filing of postconviction relief motions.\u201d Stidham v. State, 963 S.W.2d 351, 353 (Mo. App. W.D. 1998). See also Patterson v. State, 164 S.W.3d 546, 548 (Mo. App. E.D. 2005) (\u201cThe only relevant inquiry under Missouri law is when the post-conviction motion was filed with the clerk of the circuit court, not when it was mailed.\u201d); State v. Collier, 918 S.W.2d 354, 356 (Mo. App. W.D. 1996) (\u201cCollier concedes his [pro se Rule 29.15] motion was late, but argues he did all he could do to comply and should not be penalized for his lack of control over the mail. He requests that we apply the \u2018mailbox rule\u2019 to the filing of motions for post-conviction relief. We decline to do so. A post-conviction motion is considered filed when deposited with the circuit court clerk, not when the motion is mailed.\u201d (Internal quotation and citation omitted.)). Similarly, here, we decline Washington's invitation to apply a \u201cmailbox rule\u201d to the filing of his original pro se motion. \n \nHere, Washington's original pro se Rule 29.15 motion: (1) was not stamped filed by the clerk of the circuit court within the time limits required by Rule 29.15; (2) did not allege or purport to establish an exception to the time limits; and the amended motion (3) does not allege or point to any evidence in the record demonstrating that the clerk of the circuit court received the original pro se motion on or before August 27, 2013, but simply misfiled the motion. \n \nThis brings us to Washington's next argument: that though he recognizes his appointed post-conviction counsel did not assert any allegation in the amended motion that the clerk of the circuit court misfiled his pro se motion (i.e., the third method of alleging and proving timeliness), his appointed counsel should have investigated the events surrounding the filing of the original pro se motion, said counsel should have alleged in the amended motion a circuit clerk misfiling of the original pro se motion (though on appeal he points to nothing but speculation about why the original pro se motion was not stamped filed until September 4, 2013), and counsel's failure to do so constituted abandonment by post-conviction counsel. \n \nIn making this argument, Washington erroneously conflates the concepts of abandonment with a claim of ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel. \n \nIn the context of post-conviction counsel, Missouri defines \u201cabandonment\u201d narrowly. \u201c[A]bandonment is available when (1) post-conviction counsel takes no action on movant's behalf with respect to filing an amended motion \u2024 or (2) when post-conviction counsel is aware of the need to file an amended post-conviction relief motion and fails to do so in a timely manner.\u201d Barton v. State, 486 S.W.3d 332, 338 (Mo. banc 2016) (internal quotation omitted). Accordingly, \u201c[c]laims of abandonment are reviewed carefully to ensure that the true claim is abandonment and not a substitute for an impermissible claim of ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel.\u201d Id. (internal quotation omitted). \n \nHere, Washington does not claim either that his post-conviction counsel failed to file an amended motion on his behalf\u2009 3 or that the filing of the amended motion itself by post-conviction counsel was untimely. Instead, Washington argues that the substance of the argument contained within the amended motion constitutes a failure on the part of post-conviction counsel to provide him with effective assistance of counsel. As \u201c[Washington's] claim is one of ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel, [it] is categorically unreviewable in Missouri state courts.\u201d Id. \n \nBecause Washington failed to timely file his initial pro se motion, and because his amended motion failed to allege any facts supporting his qualification for a recognized exception to the Rule 29.15 filing time limit, Washington has waived both his right to proceed under Rule 29.15 and any claim that could be raised in such a motion. See Rule 29.15(b); Dorris v. State, 360 S.W.3d 260, 268 (Mo. banc 2012). The circuit court did not have authority to address Washington's motion on the merits, and instead was required to dismiss it. Miller v. State, 386 S.W.3d 225, 227 (Mo. App. W.D. 2012). In order to enforce this valid and mandatory court rule, we vacate the circuit court's judgment and remand with directions to the circuit court to dismiss Washington's pro se motion as untimely. See Dorris, 360 S.W.3d at 270. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe circuit court's judgment is vacated, and the cause is remanded to the circuit court with instructions to dismiss Washington's untimely Rule 29.15 motion. \n \nFOOTNOTES \n \n1 .  \u2003On appeal, however, the issue was raised by the State in its appellate briefing to this court, see Roberts v. State, 407 S.W.3d 89, 92 n.1 (Mo. App. W.D. 2013), and Washington was permitted to respond to the State's timeliness argument in subsequent appellate briefing to this court, see Ferguson v. State, 325 S.W.3d 400, 414 (Mo. App. W.D. 2010). \n \n2 .  \u2003All rule references are to I MISSOURI COURT RULES\u2014STATE 2013. \n \n3 .  \u2003This is the reason that Washington's reliance upon Vogl v. State, 437 S.W.3d 218 (Mo. banc 2014), is misplaced. In Vogl, the Missouri Supreme Court held that there is a presumption of abandonment by post-conviction counsel where appointed counsel fails to timely file an amended motion or a statement setting out facts demonstrating the actions taken by counsel to ensure that no amended motion was necessary. Id. at 230. Here, Washington's post-conviction counsel did, in fact, file an amended motion on Washington's behalf and there is thus no presumption that Washington's post-conviction counsel abandoned him. \n \nMark D.

MICHAEL ALLEN, Appellant. \n No. ED103776      Decided: January 17, 2017   \nIntroduction \n \nMichael Allen (\u201cAllen\u201d) was convicted on two counts of second-degree burglary following a bench trial. Allen asserts on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the State's request for a continuance mid-trial and that there was insufficient evidence to support one of his second-degree-burglary convictions. Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in continuing the bench trial for twelve days in order to hear evidence from additional witnesses and because the State presented sufficient evidence for the trial court to infer that Allen intended to steal when he entered the property at issue, we affirm the judgment of the trial court. \n \nFactual and Procedural History \n \nThe State charged Allen with four counts of second-degree burglary and three counts of stealing a firearm. The case proceeded to a bench trial, where the trial court found Allen guilty of two counts of second-degree burglary and acquitted him of all other charges. Specifically, the trial court found Allen guilty for burglaries committed at 5572 Natural Bridge Road\u2009 1 (\u201cthe Natural Bridge Burglary\u201d) and 2423 North Grand Boulevard (\u201cthe North Grand Burglary\u201d). \n \nBefore the bench trial began on September 16, 2015, the State informed the trial court that not all of the necessary witnesses were available to testify. The State requested that the trial court hold a partial hearing on September 16, 2015, and conclude the bench trial at a later date. Over Allen's objection, the trial court stated that it was inclined to permit a partial hearing for the witnesses then present and later allow additional witnesses to testify. Allen proceeded to waive his right to a jury trial. \n \nRegarding the Natural Bridge Burglary, Dominic McNair (\u201cMcNair\u201d) testified that he operated a daycare located at 5572 Natural Bridge Road. McNair received a telephone call from the alarm company on May 14, 2012, informing him of a possible burglary at the daycare. McNair met with police officers at the daycare, where he discovered that a window was broken and that a stone was lying inside the daycare near the broken window. McNair testified that a television was missing. On the mounting strip where the television had been attached to the wall, blood was found and collected. \n \nRegarding the North Grand Burglary, Reverend Timothy Cook (\u201cReverend Cook\u201d) testified that his parish owned the building at 2423 North Grand Boulevard. Reverend Cook testified that the building was known as the VCR Building because the parish rented it to an organization called Vision for Children at Risk. Reverend Cook recalled hearing a burglar alarm sound in the middle of the night on September 9, 2012. Reverend Cook received a call from the alarm company informing him of a possible burglary at the VCR Building. Reverend Cook remembered arriving at the VCR Building with police officers, observing a broken window, seeing a brick lying inside, and finding a DVD player missing from the second shelf of a television stand as wires were hanging in the air. Reverend Cook asserted that the wires hanging in the air on the television stand were of a kind normally attached to a DVD player and that someone appeared to have manipulated the wiring. Reverend Cook stated that he did not give Allen permission to enter premises, break the window, or manipulate the wiring to the electronic devices. On cross-examination, Reverend Cook testified that he did not remember seeing the DVD player on the television stand during his last visit to the VCR Building before the burglary and that he knew that a DVD player was stolen because someone told him that a DVD player was missing. The State's evidence also showed that blood was found and collected near the broken window and at several locations inside the VCR Building, including near the television stand. \n \nAt the end of the first day of the bench trial, Allen reasserted his objection to the State's request for a continuance. Allen maintained that he was arraigned on November 6, 2014, and that he filed a request for a speedy trial on July 17, 2015. Allen noted that the State previously had made multiple motions for continuances. Allen contended that the State did not notify him of the unavailability of witnesses until the morning of trial. Allen then moved for judgment of acquittal on all counts because Detective Treis had yet to testify that a buccal swab was taken from Allen, linking Allen's DNA to the blood found at the respective crime scenes. \n \nThe State countered that all witnesses were supposed to be present for the bench trial. The State thought that Detective Treis, who was on vacation, was going to make a special appearance for the bench trial. The State was unsure if Detective Treis was still in town or out of town. After the trial court informed the State that if Detective Treis was in town the State must produce him the following day, the State checked with one of its investigators off the record. The State then notified the trial court that Detective Treis was out of town. \n \nIn reviewing the State's request for a continuance, the trial court employed a balancing test and expressly considered Allen's concerns. The trial court granted the State a continuance, concluding that the length of the delay would be very short. The trial court also found that Allen would not be prejudiced by a brief continuance in the trial. The trial court scheduled the second day of the bench trial for September 28, 2015\u2014twelve days after the trial first commenced. \n \nThe State and Allen both presented witnesses on September 28, 2015. Detective Treis testified that a buccal swab was taken from Allen in his presence. The DNA from the buccal swab matched the DNA from the blood found at the crime scenes, linking Allen to the Natural Bridge Burglary and the North Grand Burglary. In Allen's offer of proof, Detective Treis testified that he was aware that the bench trial was scheduled for September 16, 2015, but that he was on vacation. Detective Treis was unsure if he was in the City of St. Louis or if he remained in Jefferson County on September 16, 2015. \n \nAt the conclusion of the bench trial, Allen moved for a judgment of acquittal as to the charges. The trial court found Allen guilty of two counts of second-degree burglary, one for each the Natural Bridge Burglary and the North Grand Burglary, but acquitted him of all other charges. The trial court then sentenced Allen to five years in prison on each of the second-degree-burglary convictions, ordering the sentences to run concurrently. This appeal follows. \n \nPoints on Appeal \n \nAllen presents two points on appeal. Allen first argues that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the State's mid-trial request for a continuance because the trial court improperly relied on the prosecutor's statement that Detective Treis was out of town. Allen next argues that the State provided insufficient evidence of his intent to commit a crime when he entered the VCR Building. Therefore, the State failed to prove a required element of second-degree burglary for the North Grand Burglary. \n \nDiscussion \n \nI. The State's Motion for a ContinuanceA. Standard of Review \n \nThe decision to grant a motion for a continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Jones, 479 S.W.3d 100, 111 (Mo. banc 2016). The trial court abuses its discretion when its ruling \u201cis clearly against the logic of the circumstances then before it and is so arbitrary and unreasonable as to shock the sense of justice and indicate a lack of careful consideration.\u201d State v. Litherland, 477 S.W.3d 156, 163 (Mo. App. E.D. 2015) (quoting State v. Wolf, 91 S.W.3d 636, 645 (Mo. App. W.D. 2002)). We review the trial court's ruling on a motion for a continuance based upon the circumstances of each case. See id. An appellant must demonstrate through a strong showing that not only did the trial court abuse its sound discretion, but also that prejudice resulted from the action of the trial court. Jones, 479 S.W.3d at 111. \n \nB. The Trial Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion in Continuing the Bench Trial \n \nAllen contends that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the State's mid-trial request for a continuance of the bench trial because the trial court improperly relied on the prosecutor's statement that Detective Treis was out of town. 2 Allen asserts that this purported trial-court error was prejudicial, as he would not have waived his right to a jury trial otherwise. Allen maintains that if he received a jury trial, the trial court would not have granted the State's request for a continuance during trial. Therefore, the jury would not have heard Detective Treis's testimony linking Allen to the blood found at the site of the burglaries. Without Detective Treis's testimony, Allen argues that he would have been acquitted on all counts. \n \nIn examining the trial court's decision to grant or deny a request for a continuance, we look to the circumstances then before the trial court. Litherland, 477 S.W.3d at 163\u201364; State v. Smith, 292 S.W.3d 595, 601 n.5 (Mo. App. S.D. 2009). Here, the State notified the trial court of the potential unavailability of witnesses before the bench trial began. The trial court then received information that a key witness was unavailable to testify as he was out of town on vacation. 3 While the trial court must consider the differing interests before it, the trial court may grant a continuance due to the temporary unavailability of key witnesses. Cf. Litherland, 477 S.W.3d at 164-65 (stating that the trial court abused its discretion by denying the defendant's request for a continuance when a key witness was temporarily unavailable); State v. Simino, 397 S.W.3d 11, 22 (Mo. App. S.D. 2013) (stating that, in the context of a speedy-trial analysis, \u201ca delay due to an unavailable witness is a valid delay\u201d justifying a continuance). \n \nThe record before us shows that the trial court expressly balanced the various interests before it, inquiring about the number of continuances requested since the filing of the motion for a speedy trial. The trial court then concluded that a twelve-day continuance in order to secure the testimony of an important witness was necessary and not prejudicial to Allen. The trial court's decision to hear testimony from the witnesses then present, and then to continue the bench trial for a short period\u2014twelve days\u2014for the presentation of additional evidence was not so unreasonable as to shock our sense of justice and indicate a lack of careful consideration. To the contrary, the record demonstrates that the trial court carefully considered the issue before rendering its ruling. \n \nAllen is also not able to show that he was prejudiced by the trial court's ruling. The record definitively establishes that Allen decided to waive his right to a jury trial after being informed that Detective Treis was unable to testify and that the trial court was inclined to grant the State's request for a continuance. If Allen desired a jury trial, he could have stated such after the State informed him of Detective Treis's unavailability. To the contrary, an informed Allen elected to waive his right to a trial by jury. Further, the record does not demonstrate that the twelve-day continuance impeded Allen's ability to call witnesses, to present evidence at trial, or to conduct an effective defense during both days of the bench trial. Because Allen has failed to make a strong showing that the trial court abused its sound discretion and that prejudice resulted, we deny Point One. \n \nII. Sufficiency of the Evidence \n \nA. Standard of Review \n \nWe review the sufficiency of the evidence in a bench trial of a criminal case to determine \u201cwhether the State presented sufficient evidence from which a trier of fact could have reasonably found the defendant guilty; and in so doing, we examine the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the verdict, ignoring all contrary evidence and inferences.\u201d State v. Brown, 360 S.W.3d 919, 922 (Mo. App. W.D. 2012) (citing State v. Johnson, 244 S.W.3d 144, 152 (Mo. banc 2008)). We will not, however, \u201csupply missing evidence, or give the State the benefit of unreasonable, speculative, or forced inferences.\u201d State v. Brown, 457 S.W.3d 772, 779 (Mo. App. E.D. 2014). \n \nB. The State Provided Sufficient Evidence \n \nAllen argues that the State did not provide sufficient evidence from which the trial court could have concluded that he entered the VCR Building with the intent to commit a crime therein, which is a required element of second-degree burglary. Allen posits that the State provided evidence establishing only that Allen was inside the VCR Building unlawfully and thus, insufficient evidence exists to support his conviction for the North Grand Burglary. \n \nSection 569.170\u2009 4 provides that a person \u201ccommits the crime of burglary in the second degree when he knowingly enters unlawfully or knowingly remains unlawfully in a building or inhabitable structure for the purpose of committing a crime therein.\u201d The State charged Allen with knowingly and unlawfully entering the VCR Building for the purpose of committing the crime of stealing. \n \nThe intent to commit a crime is an essential element of burglary that separates second-degree burglary from the lesser-included offense of first-degree trespass. State v. Gibbs, 306 S.W.3d 178, 181 (Mo. App. E.D. 2010). Yet, \u201c[i]ntent to commit a crime is most often proved by circumstantial evidence and it may be inferred from the surrounding facts or the act itself.\u201d State v. Dixon, 495 S.W.3d 812, 820 (Mo. App. S.D. 2016) (quoting State v. Wrice, 389 S.W.3d 738, 740 (Mo. App. E.D. 2013)). Circumstantial evidence alone can be sufficient to support a conviction, and the evidence need not demonstrate the impossibility of innocence. State v. Mosby, 341 S.W.3d 154, 156 (Mo. App. E.D. 2011). The State is not required to prove that the defendant actually committed the intended crime inside the building. State v. Leonard, 490 S.W.3d 730, 738 (Mo. App. W.D. 2016). \n \nAllen primarily relies on J.N.C.B. v. Juvenile Officer, 403 S.W.3d 120 (Mo. App. W.D. 2013), to argue that the State provided insufficient evidence to draw the inference of his intent to commit a crime inside the VCR Building. In J.N.C.B., a juvenile was convicted of second-degree burglary after a security guard found several juveniles noisily conversing inside a closed school at night. Id. at 123. The Western District overturned the juvenile's conviction, determining that the State only proved the juvenile's unlawful presence in the building. Id. at 129. The J.N.C.B. court noted that additional supportive facts were needed to sustain the inference that the defendant intended to commit a crime within the building, such as \u201cforced entry, flight, weapons, burglary tools, admissions, established or readily presumed knowledge of the presence of valuables, or the movement of valuable items within the building by the defendant or an accomplice.\u201d Id. at 125. Allen argues that\u2014similar to the circumstances in J.N.C.B.\u2014his mere presence in the VCR Building is insufficient to sustain his second-degree-burglary conviction. \n \nAllen's reliance on J.N.C.B. is misplaced. The J.N.C.B. court noted that the defendant's unlawful presence, along with additional supportive facts such as \u201cforced entry \u2024 or the movement of valuable items within the building by defendant[,]\u201d can sustain the inference that the defendant intended to commit a crime within the building at issue. Id. Here, Reverend Cook testified that upon arriving at the VCR Building, he noticed that the window was broken and that there was a brick lying inside the building, evidencing forced entry. Reverend Cook further testified that a DVD player was missing from second shelf of the television stand and that there were loose wires hanging in the air over the television stand. Reverend Cook stated that such wires are of the kind normally attached to a DVD player and that the wires had been manipulated. Moreover, Allen's blood was found near broken window and at several locations inside the building including the area surrounding the television stand and the electronic devices. \n \nAlthough Reverend Cook testified during cross-examination that he was not certain if the DVD player was present in the building at the time of the burglary, the State did not need to prove that Allen actually stole the DVD player. See Leonard, 490 S.W.3d at 738. Rather, Allen's forced entry into VCR Building in the middle of the night, his manipulation of the wiring to valuable electronic devices, and the presence of his blood near the electronic devices sufficiently support a reasonable inference that Allen entered the VCR Building with the intent to steal therein. See Wrice, 389 S.W.3d at 741 (defendant's unlawful presence at the building with tools and his manipulation of valuable copper wiring inside the building gave rise to the inference that defendant intended to committed a crime); State v. Jenkins, 741 S.W.2d 767, 768-69 (Mo. App. E.D. 1987) (defendant's forced entry into a home and the finding of his fingerprints near where items of value were kept sufficiently supported a second-degree-burglary conviction). \n \nUnlike the circumstances before the court in J.N.C.B., the record includes additional facts supporting a reasonable inference that Allen entered the VCR Building with the intent to steal. Because there is sufficient evidence from which the trial court could reasonably infer that Allen entered the VCR Building with the intent to commit the crime of stealing, we deny Point Two. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe judgment of the trial court is affirmed. \n \nFOOTNOTES \n \n1 .  \u2003Alien does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as to his second-degree-burglary conviction for the Natural Bridge Burglary. \n \n2 .  \u2003Allen does not assert on appeal that the trial court's ruling violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial. \n \n3 .  \u2003The fact that Detective Treis later testified that he may have been in the City of St. Louis, and thus in town on September 16, 2015, does not render the trial court's decision to continue the trial unreasonable. We must consider the reasonableness of the trial court's action under the circumstances then before it. See Smith, 292 S.W.3d at 601 n.5. Absent reason to know otherwise, the trial court's reliance on the statements of the prosecutor was not arbitrary or capricious. \n \n4 .  \u2003All statutory references are to RSMo (2000). \n \nKURT S.

Those include potentially deploying additional advisers to Iraq and Syria, allowing US military personnel to accompany local forces closer to the front lines, and delegating greater decision-making power to field commanders.\n\nDavid Barno, a retired lieutenant-general who once led US forces in Afghanistan, said it would be a major escalation if Trump's administration opted to rely on US troops by putting them into a direct combat role and effectively substitute them for local forces.\n\n\"We've been down that road, and I don't think the American people are excited about that idea,\" said Barno, who now teaches at American University in Washington, DC.\n\nAs he signed his directive at his desk in the Oval Office, Trump said: \"I think it's going to be very successful. That's big stuff.\"\n\nCounselling Trump in the effort will be Stephen Bannon, the White House chief strategist whose influence inside the administration is expanding far beyond politics. In an executive order, Trump reorganised the National Security Council to, along with other changes, give Bannon a regular seat on the principals committee - the meetings of the most senior national security officials, including the secretaries of defence and state.\n\nTrump's order also states that the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will sit on the principals committee only when the issues to be discussed pertain to their \"responsibilities and expertise\". In the previous two administrations, both were included as regular attendees.\n\nTrump said the changes would bring \"a lot of efficiency and, I think, a lot of additional safety\".\n\nThe changes affirm the ascent of Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart, a conservative website that is popular with white nationalists, who has emerged as Trump's political consigliere and the keeper of the president's populist flame.\n\nBannon has already been playing a major role in directing Trump's foreign policy, administration officials say, and joined the president in the Oval Office on Saturday for his calls with Putin and several other world leaders.\n\nIn their call, Putin and Trump discussed Ukraine and Syria, and they agreed to build stronger economic ties between the US and Russia, according to a statement issued by the Kremlin.\n\nThey said they would arrange an in-person meeting, but Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Interfax news agency that the two presidents did not specifically talk about a lifting of the sanctions the Obama administration imposed against Russia over Russian interference in the US presidential election and Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine.\n\nEliminating the sanctions is a priority for Moscow, but Trump is under pressure in the US and from European allies to maintain them and said on Friday that he thought it was premature to consider lifting them.\n\nThe White House described the conversation as \"a congratulatory call\" initiated by Putin.\n\n\"The positive call was a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair,\" read a statement from the White House. \"Both President Trump and President Putin are hopeful that after today's call the two sides can move quickly to tackle terrorism and other important issues of mutual concern.\"\n\nTrump spoke with the leaders of Australia, France, Germany and Japan, but his administration's suspension of the acceptance of all refugees and a suspension of entry by citizens from seven majority-Muslim nations injected some diplomatic tension into the conversations.\n\nIn their call, French President Francois Hollande told Trump that he believes defending their democracies would be effective only if their governments adhere to \"the principles on which they are founded, in particular the reception of refugees\", according to the Elysee Palace.\n\nTrump repeatedly blasted German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the campaign trail over the German policy of admitting large numbers of Syrian refugees. Trump and Merkel covered a range of issues, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, according to the White House.\n\nAfter Trump's criticism of NATO during his campaign, the President and Merkel agreed on the alliance's \"fundamental importance to the broader transatlantic relationship and its role in ensuring the peace and stability of our North Atlantic community\", read a White House statement.\n\nTrump accepted Merkel's invitation to visit Hamburg in July for the G20 summit, and Trump invited the chancellor to visit Washington soon, the White House said.\n\nAlso on Saturday, Trump signed an executive order finalising new lobbying rules that had been informally established during the transition period. It stipulates that administration officials cannot register as lobbyists for five years after leaving the government - and can never lobby on behalf of a foreign government.\n\n\"Most of the people standing behind me won't be able to go to work or do anything adverse to our wonderful country,\" Trump said, as the aides standing behind him in the Oval Office laughed.\n\nWashington Post, Reuters","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Philip Rucker and David Filipov"},"topics":[{"name":"Terrorism news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Trump's busy day: Islamic State, Putin and Stephen Bannon","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"6004","state":"Western Australia","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"East Perth","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"WA Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169588399","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"27"},"name":"WA Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.watoday.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196415018","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

KANSAS CITY POWER & LIGHT COMPANY, Respondent. \n WD 79299      Decided: January 17, 2017  Before Division Three: Alok Ahuja, P.J., Victor C. Howard, and James Edward Welsh, JJ. \nNick Savage appeals from the circuit court's judgment following a jury trial in which the jury assessed zero percent fault to Kansas City Power and Light (KCP&L) and 100 percent fault to Savage on Savage's personal injury claim against KCP&L. Savage contends that the circuit court erred in submitting KCP&L's comparative fault instruction to the jury because the instruction was not supported by substantial evidence and attributed a duty to him that did not exist. We affirm. \n \nThe evidence established that Savage lived at the corner of NE 45th Street and Bellefontaine in Kansas City, Missouri, which is within the Northland Service Center of KCP&L's electrical grid. On the north side of Savage's home, a primary, uninsulated distribution power line (the primary line) runs along 45th Street. The power from this primary line conducts a high voltage electrical current, too high to go to a house directly. Therefore, the voltage from the primary line is sent through a transformer that reduces the voltage, which is then ran along secondary lines. The individual houses in the area get electricity off of secondary lines from service poles via electrical lines called service drops. For Savage's house, the service pole is on the opposite side of the yard from the primary line in the southeast corner of his backyard. The service drop line runs essentially diagonal across Savage's yard from the service pole to Savage's home. \n \nOn Sunday, August 7, 2011, a strong thunderstorm damaged a large silver maple tree in Savage's backyard. The tree sat on the side of the yard closest to 45th Street and close to the primary line. As a result of the storm, a limb from the tree fell on the service drop line that ran across Savage's backyard. The weight of the limb pulled the service drop line down and pulled the electrical connection off of Savage's house. Although the weather head connection and electrical meter were pulled off Savage's house, the service drop line remained connected. The loose and damaged service drop line wire was down across Savage's yard and draped over a children's swing set. As a result of the damage, Savage did not have any electrical power in his house. \n \nSavage telephoned KCP&L and reported that he had no electrical power in his house and that the electrical box and the service drop line had been ripped off the back of his house because of the storm damage. Later that evening, a KCP&L lineman arrived to investigate the circumstances. The lineman testified that he could not recall working at Savage's house, but Savage testified that the lineman left the live service drop line down, told Savage to stay out of the backyard, and told him that someone would be out in the next couple of days to take care of things. When Savage inquired who would be responsible for cleaning up the tree and getting the electrical box and connection back on the house, the lineman told Savage that the homeowner would be responsible for doing those things. \n \nThe next day, on Monday, August 8, Savage called KCP&L again, reported that the downed service drop line was making some noises, and asked when KCP&L would be sending someone out to work on it. KCP&L said that they would send someone out to get it taken care of and told Savage that he was responsible for taking care of the tree \u201cand getting everything fixed back the way it should be.\u201d \n \nOn Tuesday, August 9, KCP&L Lineman Gerald Peterson went to Savage's house to disconnect the live service drop line. He removed the live service drop line that had been draped on the swing set and coiled it up and put it at the foot of the service poll. At that point, Peterson let Savage know that it was safe to work in the backyard. Peterson told Savage that it was his responsibility \u201cto put the riser and the new meter can [up]\u201d and \u201cto mount the riser up to the weather head\u201d with the wire to give KCP&L a point of attachment for the service drop. Peterson informed Savage that, once all of that was done, Savage should call KCP&L and someone would come back and reconnect his service line to the weather head. \n \nAt trial, Peterson did not deny that he told Savage that he would be responsible for cleaning up the tree; Peterson merely said he did not remember telling Savage that. Peterson said that he did not recall any conversations with Savage about his plans for trimming the tree, but Peterson said nothing was said about Savage climbing and trimming trees. Peterson also said that he did not have any conversations with Savage telling him that he needed to notify KCP&L before trimming any tree. Peterson acknowledged that he did not pay attention to how many broken limbs there were, how many broken tree limbs were in the tree hanging loose, or whether there were any tree branches growing off the big tree that were still growing over the service drop area of Savage's house. Although Peterson said that he could not remember whether there were any tree limbs hanging over the area where the service drop line would be, Peterson said that, before attaching the service drop line, \u201cyou usually look up and see if there's anything in the way,\u201d and, from what he could tell, \u201cit was clear.\u201d Peterson said that, if the point of attachment had been on Savage's house, he could have reattached the service drop line at that time. Peterson also said that he never looked at the branches of tree to see where they were in relationship to the primary line. \n \nLater that morning, Savage, with the help of his father, his brother, and a friend, began cleaning up the backyard. Savage cleaned up the area of the yard under where the service drop line would be restrung. Savage then took photographs of the area that showed that the yard beneath where the service drop line would be reconnected had been cleaned up. After cleaning up the service drop area, Savage decided to trim branches on the tree \u201cthat hung over the power line or where the drop line was supposed to go\u201d and to \u201cclean up all the limbs on [the] house side of the tree\u201d to eliminate future problems. Savage used a ladder to climb up into the tree and used a small rope, tied from his belt to a small chain saw, to lift up the chain saw for use in the tree. After climbing into the tree, Savage climbed onto a large branch closest to the service drop and his house. Savage cut a couple of branches over the service drop area. He then moved to the \u201cparent branch\u201d of the tree to cut the \u201csubject limb\u201d 1 that resulted in his injuries. The \u201csubject limb\u201d had not been damaged in the storm. Savage acknowledged that he knew where the primary line was and knew that the \u201csubject limb\u201d could come into contact with the primary line when he was cutting it. Savage said, however, that he believed the \u201csubject limb\u201d would only brush against it. As Savage prepared to cut the \u201csubject limb,\u201d he wrapped his left arm and left leg around the trunk of the \u201csubject limb\u201d to secure himself, and, with his right foot standing on the \u201cparent branch\u201d and holding the chain saw above his head, he began cutting the \u201csubject limb.\u201d Savage took no other precautions to prevent himself from falling out of the tree. When he cut the \u201csubject limb,\u201d the limb fell onto the high voltage primary line, conducting electricity, and electrocuting Savage. Savage was rendered unconscious and fell from the tree, falling about 25 feet. \n \nAs a result of the incident, Savage suffered electrical burns to his left arm and left leg, and he had compression fractures at levels T-10 and T-11, resulting in the severance of his spinal cord leaving him paralyzed and losing the use of his legs. \n \nSavage never told Peterson that he intended to prune the tree near the primary line. According to Peterson's notes taken after Savage was injured, Peterson stated, \u201cwhen I left that morning, nothing was said about the customer cutting trees.\u201d According to Peterson, if KCP&L had known Savage was going to prune the tree over the primary line, Peterson would have told Savage to contact a qualified tree service or to contact KCP&L for help. \n \nAt trial, Savage acknowledged that one way to direct a cut branch away from electrical lines would have been to use a rope to pull it in the direction that you wanted to go. Savage acknowledged, however, that he did not do that when cutting the \u201csubject limb.\u201d Savage also did not the cut the branch in a manner that it would tend to fall away from the overhead line. Savage's expert acknowledged that Savage did not make a clean cut of the subject limb; rather, Savage cut the limb so that it hinged and dropped in an arc into the primary line. According to Savage's own expert, a clean cut depends on doing an undercut first and then an overcut to prevent it from hinging. \n \nSavage filed a petition for damages against KCP&L for personal injuries resulting from the electrical shock that caused him to fall from the tree. Savage alleged that KCP&L maintained the primary uninsulated power line adjacent to Savage's Property; that tree limbs from Savage's tree were close to and above the primary line presenting an unreasonable risk of harm, and that it was reasonably foreseeable that persons would be trimming tree limbs of the tree in the backyard. Further, Savage alleged that the tree limb came into contact with the primary line because of KCP&L's failure to maintain a clearance between the tree limbs and the primary line. KCP&L alleged in its answer as an affirmative defense that Savage bore the responsibility for his injuries because he failed to notify KCP&L that he would be performing work in the trees near the power line. \n \nA jury trial was held on August 24, 2015, through September 2, 2015. Savage offered Instruction No. 6, a comparative-fault-modified verdict director instruction setting out disjunctive allegations of negligence by KCP&L, which was given by the court. Instruction No. 6 read: \n \nIn your verdict, you must assess a percentage of fault to [KCP&L] whether or not [Savage] was partly at fault, if you believe: \n \nFirst either \n \n[KCP&L] failed to use natural directional pruning to prune the parent branch to the tree trunk, or \n \n[KCP&L] failed to prune the subject branch back to the parent branch, or \n \n[KCP&L] failed to tell [Savage] that [KCP&L] would do the necessary pruning or removal to clear the service drop, or \n \n[KCP&L] failed to warn [Savage] not to prune tree limbs in the Silver Maple, and \n \nSecond, [KCP&L], in any one or more of the respects submitted in paragraph First, was thereby negligent, and \n \nThird, such negligence directly caused or directly contributed to cause damage to [Savage]. The term \u201cnegligent\u201d or \u201cnegligence\u201d as used in this instruction means the failure to use the highest degree of care. The phrase \u201chighest degree of care\u201d means that degree of care that a very careful person would use under the same or similar circumstances. \n \nKCP&L offered Instruction Number 7, a comparative fault instruction, which was also given by the circuit court. Instruction Number 7 said: \n \nIn your verdict, you must assess a percentage of fault to [Savage] whether or not [KCP&L] was partly at fault, if you believe \n \nFirst, [Savage] either, \n \nFailed to notify [KCP&L] of his plan to prune the Silver Maple, or \n \nCut the subject tree branch in such a way that it contacted the primary distribution power line, or \n \nFailed to use a rope to keep the cut branch from contacting the power line, or \n \nFailed to secure himself to the tree while pruning the subject tree branch, and \n \nSecond, in any one of or more of the respects submitted in paragraph First, [Savage] was thereby negligent, and \n \nThird such negligence directly caused or directly contributed to cause any damage [Savage] may have sustained. \n \nThe term \u201cnegligent\u201d or \u201cnegligence\u201d as used in this instruction means the failure to use that degree of care than an ordinarily careful person would use under the same or similar circumstances. \n \nSavage objected to the court's giving Instruction Number 7, arguing that no evidence supported the proposition that he had a duty or responsibility to notify KCP&L of his plan to prune the tree and that the submission that he failed to secure himself to the tree while pruning was a roving commission. \n \nThe jury returned a verdict for KCP&L, finding zero percent fault on the part of KCP&L and 100 percent fault to Savage. Savage filed a motion for new trial alleging instructional error based upon the circuit court's submission of Instruction Number 7 to the jury. The circuit court denied Savage's motion for new trial. Savage appeals. \n \nIn his sole point relied on, Savage asserts that the circuit court erred in submitting KCP&L's comparative fault instruction, Instruction Number 7, to the jury because the instruction was not supported by substantial evidence and attributed a duty to him that did not exist. \n \nWhether a jury was instructed properly is a question of law that we review de novo. Fleshner v. Pepose Vision Inst., P.C., 304 S.W.3d 81, 90 (Mo. banc 2010). When reviewing claims of instructional error, we will reverse a jury verdict on the ground of instructional error if the error resulted in prejudice that \u201cmaterially affected the merits of the action.\u201d Coomer v. Kansas City Royals Baseball Corp., 437 S.W.3d 184, 191 (Mo. banc 2014). \n \nWe need not address Savage's contentions that KCP&L's comparative fault instruction was not supported by substantial evidence because, even if the instruction was erroneous, Savage cannot show that the alleged erroneous instruction resulted in prejudice that materially affected the merits of the action. \n \nThe Missouri Supreme Court has emphatically stated that, where a plaintiff's verdict directing instruction requires a jury to assess a percentage of fault to the defendant if the jury believes certain factual propositions and the jury assesses no fault to the defendant, the jury verdict assessing no fault to the defendant negates any claim of prejudice to plaintiff in the giving of a comparative fault instruction, even if the instruction was erroneous. Wilson v. Shanks, 785 S.W.2d 282, 285 (Mo. banc 1990); Lee v. Mirbaha, 722 S.W.2d 80, 82-84 (Mo. banc 1986); and Barnes v. Tools & Machinery Builders, Inc., 715 S.W.2d 518, 520-22 (Mo. banc 1986). As the Wilson court explained: \n \n[W]e must assume the jury followed the instructions. Instruction No. 8 required some assessment of fault to defendant if the jury found the facts hypothesized to be true. The assessment of fault was not dependent upon and made no reference to Instruction No. 10. The jury necessarily must have concluded that one of the essential propositions was not established when it failed to assess any fault to defendant. Absent some assessment of fault to defendant, there was no prejudice in giving the contributory fault instruction. \n \n785 S.W.2d at 285. \n \nAll three districts of the Court of Appeals have followed the Missouri Supreme Court's directions without exception. See Rouse v. Cuvelier, 363 S.W.3d 406, 413 (Mo. App. W.D. 2012) (\u201c\u2009\u2018Any error in submitting a comparative fault instruction is harmless when the jury returns a verdict attributing one hundred percent fault to the complaining party.\u2019\u2009\u201d); Marion v. Marcus, 199 S.W.3d 887, 896 (Mo. App. W.D. 2006) (Because the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants, \u201c\u2009\u2018the jury was never required to reach the question of apportionment of fault.\u2019 Therefore, although the instruction contained an error, the jury never needed to consider the erroneous instruction. The error resulted in no prejudice.\u201d); Powderly v. S. Cty. Anesthesia Assocs., Ltd., 245 S.W.3d 267, 279 (Mo. App. E.D. 2008) (\u201cThe absence of any assessment of fault to Defendants negates any claim of prejudice to Plaintiffs in giving the erroneous comparative fault instruction.\u201d); and Skinner v. Leggett & Platt, Inc., 325 S.W.3d 520, 525 (Mo. App. S.D. 2010) 2 (\u201c[T]he verdict in this case, finding zero fault in Respondent, negates any allegation of error in giving a comparative fault instruction.\u201d). \n \nThus, in this case, the comparative fault instruction \u201cdid not materially affect the merits of the action because had the comparative fault instruction not been given, the jury would have simply rendered a verdict in [KCP&L's] favor, since they found that [Savage] did not meet his burden to show that [KCP&L's] alleged negligence was in any way the cause of the accident.\u201d Rouse, 363 S.W.3d at 413. \n \nSavage argues that the rule that the absence of any assessment of fault to a defendant negates any claim of prejudice to a plaintiff in the giving of the erroneous comparative fault instruction has become \u201cincreasingly generic\u201d and that the rule is not applicable in this case because the comparative fault instruction directly affects the verdict directing instruction given to the jury. In support of this contention, Savage relies on Instruction Number 2, which was given to the jury and instructed the jury that each instruction was \u201cequally binding upon you\u201d and that the jury \u201cshould consider each instruction in light of and in harmony with the other instructions\u201d and \u201capply the instructions as a whole to the evidence.\u201d The instruction also stated that the \u201corder in which the instructions are given is not indication of their relative importance.\u201d Savage asserts that Instruction Number 2 required the jury to review and consider both Instruction Number 7 and Instruction Number 6. Savage argues: \n \nThere was no indication or instruction to the jury that if they found for [KCP&L] under Instruction No. 6, they could skip over to the verdict form. \u2024 The way the instructions were presented to the jury, in parallel, there was no distinction for what order they must be evaluated in\u2014and there was no indication to the jury that they did not consider the erroneous Instruction No. 7 and the effect that it had on Instruction No. 6. \n \nInstruction Number 2, however, is given in all Missouri cases since at least 1980 and would have been read to juries in every Missouri case, including all the cases that we noted above. \n \nSavage also argues that he was prejudiced by errors in Instruction No. 7, despite the jury's assessment of zero fault to KCP&L, because the wording of Instruction No. 7 diminished or extinguished KCP&L's duties as described in Instruction No. 6. In particular, Savage argues that Instruction No. 7's statement that he may have been negligent by \u201c[f]ail[ing] to notify [KCP&L] of his plan to prune the Silver Maple\u201d negated the specification in Instruction No. 6 that KCP&L could be negligent for \u201cfail[ing] to warn plaintiff not to prune tree limbs on the Silver Maple.\u201d We fail to see the necessary linkage between these aspects of Instruction Nos. 6 and 7. Nothing in the instructions indicates that KCP&L's duty to warn was contingent on Savage first having notified the company of his intention to prune the tree. Instead, any duty to warn could exist independently of Savage's duty to notify KCP&L of his specific intentions. Savage cannot establish prejudice from any errors in Instruction No. 7 on the theory that Instruction No. 7 somehow influenced the jury's reading of the specifications of negligence in Instruction No. 6. \n \nFurther, as explained by the Missouri Supreme Court, where a verdict directing instruction is self-contained, any alleged error in the comparative fault instruction does not require reversal \u201cbecause the jury found no basis for liability against the defendant and returned a general verdict for the defendant under instructions not dependent on\u201d the comparative fault instruction. Barnes, 715 S.W.2d at 521. In Barnes, the plaintiff claimed that the definition of \u201cnegligence\u201d in the comparative fault instruction had confused the jury and undermined the verdict directing instruction. Id. The Missouri Supreme Court rejected this argument, noting that because the verdict directing instruction was self-contained, it could not have been affected by errors in the comparative fault instruction: \n \nThe plaintiff's problem is that Instruction No. 6 is a full and complete verdict director which commands the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff if it finds the four facts there hypothesized. It contains no \u201ctail\u201d referring to erroneous Instruction No. 8. The jury returned an unequivocal verdict for the defendant, actually writing in the defendant's name as prevailing party. We must assume that it followed its instructions and would have assessed a percentage of fault against the defendant if it had found that the four hypotheses were established. The jury must necessarily have concluded that the plaintiff did not establish at least one of these four propositions by proof meeting the required standard. \n \nId. \n \nThe same is true in this case. The verdict directing instruction did not refer to any other instructions and certainly not to the comparative fault submission in Instruction Number 7. The verdict director instructed the jury to find for plaintiff \u201cwhether or not plaintiff was partly at fault.\u201d Thus, like the verdict director in Barnes, Instruction No. 6 was \u201cfull and complete\u201d and stood on its own without any reference to any other instruction. \n \nThe directive that the jury consider KCP&L's fault independently of any assessment of fault to Savage is repeated on the verdict form itself. Following MAI 37.07, the verdict form begins with the following explanatory note: \n \nComplete the following paragraph by filling in the blanks as required by your verdict. If you assess a percentage of fault to any of those listed below, write in a percentage not greater than 100%, otherwise write in \u201czero\u201d next to that name. If you assess a percentage of fault to any of those listed below, the total of such percentages must be 100%. \n \nThe verdict form then indicates that the fault assessed by the jury to all parties must total \u201czero OR 100%.\u201d Thus, the verdict form makes clear that the jury could assess zero fault to KCP&L without considering whether any assessment of fault to Savage was warranted under Instruction No. 7. We presume the jury followed the instructions and would have assessed a percentage of fault against KCP&L if it found that Savage had proven one or more elements of his claim. The jury, however, found for KCP&L by expressly writing in \u201c0%\u201d fault on the verdict form. We, therefore, conclude that the absence of any assessment of fault to KCP&L would negate any claim of prejudice to Savage in the giving of the comparative fault instruction, even if the instruction was erroneous. \n \nWe affirm the circuit court's judgment. \n \nFOOTNOTES \n \n1 .  \u2003Throughout the trial, the parties referred to the limb that caused Savage's injuries as the \u201csubject limb.\u201d For consistency purposes, we will also refer to the limb as the \u201csubject limb.\u201d \n \n2 .  \u2003Savage noted that the Southern District in 1986 was less than enthusiastic following the Missouri Supreme Court's mandate when it stated in Bushong v. Marathon Elec. Mfg. Corp., 719 S.W.2d 828 (Mo. App. 1986) that \u201cunder the constraint of the [law], this court reaches the reluctant conclusion that although Instruction No. 7 [\u2009(arguing disjunctive theories of negligence on the part of plaintiff)\u2009] was not supported by the evidence and was erroneous, the error was not reversible\u201d when the jury did not otherwise contribute to a general verdict for the defendant. Id. at 838. Enthusiastic or not, the Bushong court was bound to follow the most recent controlling decision of the Missouri Supreme Court. Indeed, the decisions of the Missouri Supreme Court are \u201ccontrolling in all other courts,\u201d and we are constitutionally bound to follow those decisions. Mo.

WD 78521      Decided: January 10, 2017  Before Division One: Anthony Rex Gabbert, P.J., and Thomas H. Newton and Alok Ahuja, JJ.Christian Lemberg, Columbia, MO for appellant Daniel N. McPherson, Jefferson City, MO for respondent \nFollowing a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Cass County, Charles Baldwin was convicted of three class C felonies: \u2009stealing; \u2009tampering with the victim of a crime; \u2009and unlawful possession of a firearm. \n \nBaldwin appeals, challenging his convictions for stealing and victim tampering. He argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of victim tampering. He also contends that the trial court erred in convicting him of felony stealing, in light of the Missouri Supreme Court's interpretation of the governing statute in State v. Bazell, 497 S.W.3d 263 (Mo. banc 2016). \n \nWe reject Baldwin's sufficiency challenge to the victim tampering conviction. We conclude, however, that under Bazell Baldwin's stealing offense constituted a class A misdemeanor, not a class C felony. The classification of the stealing charge as a misdemeanor has the effect of also reducing the classification of Baldwin's victim-tampering offense from a felony to a misdemeanor. We accordingly reverse both convictions, and remand the case to the trial court with instructions to enter a judgment convicting Baldwin of the class A misdemeanors of stealing and victim tampering, and to resentence him accordingly. \n \nFactual Background \n \nOn Sunday, January 13, 2013, Ruby and Kevin Hobbs discovered that a Jimenez .380 caliber handgun had been stolen from their home in Pleasant Hill. 1 Ruby had purchased the handgun in December 2012 as a Christmas present for her husband Kevin. Ruby purchased the firearm in her own name because Kevin is a convicted felon, and therefore could not own or possess a firearm himself. \n \nJanuary 13, 2013, was the Hobbses' first wedding anniversary. Ruby and Kevin were away from home for much of the day attending church and visiting with friends. Ruby received a call from Baldwin that afternoon. Baldwin was in a romantic relationship with Nicole Hobbs, Kevin's daughter and Ruby's stepdaughter; \u2009Baldwin and Nicole were cohabiting and had a child together. \n \nBaldwin asked Ruby what she and Kevin were doing, and whether they were at home. Ruby said that they were out, but would be home in a couple of hours; \u2009she told Baldwin that he was welcome to visit then. Baldwin declined, saying that he would come another time. Ruby testified that she was surprised to receive Baldwin's call, because he usually called Kevin, and had never called her directly in the past. \n \nWhile Ruby and Kevin were away from home, their neighbor Mary Clevenger heard a vehicle coming down the road playing loud music. Clevenger looked out of her kitchen window and saw a dark-colored sport-utility vehicle pull into the Hobbses' driveway. (Clevenger's description matched Baldwin's vehicle.) Clevenger saw a man exit the vehicle and walk up to the Hobbses' front door. After standing at the door for a moment the man walked around to the back of the house. At this point Clevenger stopped watching. She testified that she did not see or hear the man leave the property. \n \nAfter returning home on January 13, Ruby and Kevin noticed that there were tire marks in the snow in their driveway, and footprints leading to the front door. They also discovered a footprint between the main and screen doors at the back of their house, and footprints on their back deck. The couple did not initially notice anything in their home to be out of order. Later, however, they realized that their .380 caliber Jimenez handgun was missing from the nightstand in their bedroom. Ruby called Baldwin to ask if he had been to the house. He said that he had not. Ruby then called the police to report what had happened, including the call from Baldwin earlier in the day. \n \nPolice arrested Baldwin in connection with the theft. Baldwin called Nicole from a holding cell after his arrest. The phone call was recorded and was admitted into evidence at trial. During the call Nicole stated that she did not know why Ruby and Kevin would suspect Baldwin. He responded: \u2009\u201cbecause I did it, baby.\u201d Baldwin asked Nicole to tell Kevin that if he \u201cdropped the charges,\u201d he would get his gun back. Baldwin continued: \u2009\u201cAnd tell him if he doesn't drop the charges, he can kiss good-bye of ever seeing his grandson.\u201d \n \nRuby testified that, after Baldwin was released from jail, he returned the gun to her. He asked Ruby and Kevin to drop the charges, but Ruby responded that at that point it was out of their hands. \n \nBaldwin testified at trial that he and Nicole were staying at the Hobbses' house the weekend when the gun went missing. According to Baldwin, he, Nicole and Kevin were using methamphetamine while Ruby was at work. Baldwin testified that he hid the gun under the bathroom sink because it made him feel safer. He also testified that he and Nicole left the Hobbses' residence around noon on Sunday, January 13, but that he returned in the afternoon because Kevin asked him to. Baldwin testified that nobody answered at either the front or the back door when he returned, so he \u201ctook off\u201d without entering the home. Baldwin denied removing the gun from the Hobbses' residence, but testified that, after he was released from jail, he told Kevin where he had hidden the gun. \n \nBaldwin was charged with four class C felonies: \u2009second-degree burglary for entering the home of Ruby Hobbs to steal a firearm, in violation of §\u2002569.170\u2009 2 (Count I); \u2009stealing a firearm owned by Ruby Hobbs, in violation of §\u2002570.030 (Count II); \u2009tampering with Kevin Hobbs, a victim of burglary and stealing, in violation of §\u2002575.270 (Count III)); \u2009and unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of §\u2002571.070 (Count IV). Count III alleged that Baldwin had attempted to tamper with Kevin by instructing Nicole during their recorded jailhouse conversation to advise Kevin that if he dropped the charges he would get his gun back, but that if he did not, Kevin would not be allowed to see his grandson in the future. The information alleged that Baldwin was a persistent offender based on his convictions in September 2006 of unlawful use of a weapon and possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute. \n \nAfter a two-day trial, a jury found Baldwin guilty of stealing a firearm, tampering with a victim, and being a felon in possession of a handgun. The jury acquitted Baldwin of the burglary charge. The court sentenced him to five-year terms of imprisonment for each of the three convictions, with the sentences to run concurrently. \n \nBaldwin now appeals, challenging his convictions for stealing and victim tampering. \n \nDiscussion \n \nI. \n \nBaldwin's first Point contends that the State failed to present sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Kevin Hobbs was a victim of either burglary or stealing, and that Baldwin's conviction of victim tampering must accordingly be reversed. \n \nWhen reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the standard of review is whether there is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror might have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom are viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, disregarding any evidence and inferences contrary to the verdict. This is not an assessment of whether the Court believes that the evidence at trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt but rather a question of whether, in light of the evidence most favorable to the State, any rational fact-finder could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. \n \nState v. Jones, 479 S.W.3d 100, 105 (Mo. banc 2016) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). To the extent Baldwin's sufficiency claim raises issues of statutory interpretation, we review such legal questions de novo. State v. Meyers, 333 S.W.3d 39, 46\u201347 (Mo. App. W.D. 2010). \n \nThe victim tampering statute, §\u2002575.270.2, provides in relevant part: \n \nA person commits the crime of \u201cvictim tampering\u201d if, with purpose to do so, he prevents or dissuades or attempts to prevent or dissuade any person who has been a victim of any crime or a person who is acting on behalf of any such victim from: \n \n(1) Making any report of such victimization to any peace officer, or state, local or federal law enforcement officer, or prosecuting agency or to any judge; \n \n(2) Causing a complaint, indictment or information to be sought and prosecuted or assisting in the prosecution thereof; \n \n(3) Arresting or causing or seeking the arrest of any person in connection with such victimization. \n \nIn order to convict a defendant of victim tampering, the evidence must be sufficient for the jury to find \u201cthat the object of the tampering is \u2018a victim of any crime.\u2019\u2009\u201d State v. Owens, 270 S.W.3d 533, 537 (Mo. App. W.D. 2008). In Owens, the accused was charged with tampering with the victim of statutory sodomy. The jury acquitted the defendant of the underlying statutory sodomy charge, but nevertheless convicted him of victim tampering. Id. at 536. We held that the defendant's \u201cconviction for attempted victim tampering cannot survive his acquittal for statutory sodomy,\u201d and reversed the victim-tampering conviction. Id. at 544. \n \nUnder Owens, Baldwin's victim-tampering conviction cannot be sustained on the basis that Kevin Hobbs was the victim of burglary, because the jury acquitted Baldwin of the burglary charge. \n \nBaldwin argues that Kevin Hobbs could not be a \u201cvictim\u201d of the stealing offense either. Baldwin emphasizes that Kevin was a convicted felon who could not lawfully own or possess the gun. According to Baldwin, Kevin could not be a victim of stealing if he had no legal right to own or possess the stolen item. We disagree. \n \n\u201cA person commits the crime of stealing if he or she appropriates property or services of another with the purpose to deprive him or her thereof, either without his or her consent or by means of deceit or coercion.\u201d §\u2002570.030.1. Section 570.010(11) provides that the phrase \u201cof another\u201d includes \u201ca possessory or proprietary interest\u201d in property. \n \nMissouri courts have repeatedly held that a stealing or larceny conviction can be supported by evidence that the defendant took property from someone who possessed it, even if the victim did not own or hold legal title to the stolen property. 3 These cases use terms like \u201crightful possession,\u201d 4 \u201clawful possession,\u201d 5 and \u201clawful custody and control\u201d 6 to describe the types of possessory interests which a victim must hold to support a stealing conviction. Baldwin seizes on the references to \u201clawful\u201d or \u201crightful\u201d possession in these cases, and argues that Kevin Hobbs could not be a \u201clawful\u201d or \u201crightful\u201d possessor of the handgun, when he was prohibited by law from owning or possessing it. \n \nWe are unpersuaded. First, the references to \u201crightful\u201d or \u201clawful\u201d possession have their genesis in decisions which predate the adoption of Missouri's Criminal Code in 1977. The Code for the first time expressly defined the phrase \u201cof another.\u201d The definition enacted in 1977 provides that \u201ca possessory \u2024 interest\u201d is sufficient to support a stealing conviction, §\u2002570.010(11); \u2009it does not require that the possessory interest be \u201crightful\u201d or \u201clawful.\u201d \n \nSecond, the references to \u201crightful\u201d or \u201clawful\u201d possession in the cited cases are dicta. The issue in those cases was whether property could be stolen from someone who merely possessed it, but was not the property's owner; \u2009the decisions hold that possession of property, even without ownership, is sufficient to support a conviction of stealing or larceny. The outcome in none of those cases depended, however, on whether the possession was\u2014or was not\u2014\u201crightful\u201d or \u201clawful.\u201d \n \nWhen the necessity of \u201crightful\u201d or \u201clawful\u201d possession was actually at issue, the Eastern District of this Court held that Missouri law imposes no such requirement. In State v. Jordan, 404 S.W.3d 292 (Mo. App. E.D. 2012), the defendant was convicted of robbery for forcibly stealing illegal drugs. On appeal, he argued that \u201cillegal drugs cannot support a conviction for robbery under Missouri law because stolen property must be lawfully possessed.\u201d Id. at 299 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Eastern District rejected this argument. Id. Citing §§\u2002570.010 and 570.030, the Court held that it was sufficient that the victim \u201chad a possessory interest in the drugs\u201d; \u2009\u201cunder Missouri law, illegal drugs can be \u2018forcibly stolen\u2019 to support a robbery conviction.\u201d Id. at 300; \u2009see also State v. Doss, 394 S.W.3d 486, 492 n. 8 (Mo. App. W.D. 2013) (dictum; \u2009noting that defendant's admission to stealing marijuana would have supported a robbery conviction). \n \nAs in Jordan, Kevin Hobbs had a sufficient possessory interest in the stolen handgun to make him a victim of the theft, even though he could not lawfully possess the firearm due to his prior felony conviction. \n \nIt is irrelevant that the stealing count in the information (Count II) charged Baldwin with stealing a firearm \u201cwhich was owned by Ruby Hobbs \u2024 without the consent of Ruby Hobbs and with the purpose to deprive her thereof.\u201d Missouri law plainly contemplates that there may be multiple victims to a stealing offense: \u2009the property's owner or owners, but also those non-owners who are in possession of the property. The fact that the information alleged that Ruby was a victim of the theft, because of her ownership of the gun, is consistent with the conclusion that Kevin was also a victim, because he possessed the firearm. \n \nPoint I is denied. \n \nII. \n \nBaldwin's second Point argues that the trial court erred in convicting him of the class C felony of stealing. According to Baldwin, the Missouri Supreme Court's decision in State v. Bazell, 497 S.W.3d 263 (Mo. banc 2016), requires that this offense be classified as a class A misdemeanor. We agree. \n \nSection 570.030 provides in relevant part: \n \n1. A person commits the crime of stealing if he or she appropriates property or services of another with the purpose to deprive him or her thereof, either without his or her consent or by means of deceit or coercion. \n \n\u2024 \n \n3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any offense in which the value of property or services is an element is a class C felony if: \n \n\u2024 \n \n(3) The property appropriated consists of: \n \n\u2024 \n \n(d) Any firearms. \n \n\u2024 \n \n10. Any violation of this section for which no other penalty is specified in this section is a class A misdemeanor. \n \nAfter Baldwin's trial and conviction, the Missouri Supreme Court interpreted these statutory provisions in Bazell. The defendant in Bazell was convicted of two separate counts of stealing firearms. As here, the trial court characterized the two stealing offenses as class C felonies in reliance on §\u2002570.030.3(3)(d). On appeal, the Supreme Court held that the enhancement provisions in §\u2002570.030.3 did not apply to the offense of stealing defined in §\u2002570.030.1. The Court explained: \n \nthe felony enhancement provision, by its own terms, only applies if the offense is one \u201cin which the value of the property or services is an element.\u201d Stealing is defined in section 570.030.1 as \u201cappropriat[ing] property or services of another with the purpose to deprive him or her thereof, either without his consent or by means of deceit or coercion.\u201d The value of the property or services appropriated is not an element of the offense of stealing. \n \n497 S.W.3d at 266. The court concluded that stealing a firearm must be classified as a class A misdemeanor. Id. at 267. \n \nIn light of the Supreme Court's interpretation of §\u2002570.030.3 in Bazell, Baldwin requests that his conviction for felony stealing be reversed, and that the case be remanded to the circuit court for entry of a conviction, and resentencing, for misdemeanor stealing. The State concedes that Baldwin's stealing conviction is subject to the holding in Bazell, and agrees that this case should be remanded to the circuit court for entry of a judgment convicting him of a class A misdemeanor, and for resentencing accordingly. \n \nWhere the facts found by a jury fail to support conviction of a greater offense, but are sufficient to support a defendant's conviction of a lesser offense, we have the authority to order entry of a conviction of the lesser offense. See, e.g., State v. Blair, 443 S.W.3d 677, 684 (Mo. App. W.D. 2014). That relief is warranted in this case. In convicting Baldwin of felony stealing, the jury necessarily found that he had committed each of the elements of class A misdemeanor stealing (in addition to finding that the stolen property consisted of a firearm, a fact which is now legally irrelevant). Baldwin does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction of class A misdemeanor stealing, and in fact invites entry of a misdemeanor conviction. Bazell, which was decided after Baldwin's trial, rejected the prevailing interpretation of the stealing statute. In these circumstances, entry of a conviction for the class A misdemeanor is justified. \n \nReversal of Baldwin's felony stealing conviction also affects his conviction of victim tampering. Baldwin was convicted of, and sentenced for, the class C felony of victim tampering. Under §\u2002575.270.3, \u201cvictim tampering is a class C felony if the original charge is a felony. Otherwise, tampering with a witness or victim tampering is a class A misdemeanor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As explained above, Kevin Hobbs was the victim of misdemeanor\u2014not felony\u2014stealing. Therefore, the victim-tampering offense is likewise a class A misdemeanor, and reversal of Baldwin's conviction of felony victim tampering is required. We direct the circuit court on remand to enter a conviction of, and resentence Baldwin for, class A misdemeanor victim tampering. \n \nPoint II is granted. \n \nConclusion \n \nWe reverse the trial court's judgment convicting Baldwin of the class C felonies of stealing and victim tampering. We remand the case to the circuit court with instructions to enter a judgment convicting Baldwin of class A misdemeanor stealing and victim tampering, and to resentence Baldwin accordingly. Baldwin did not challenge his conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm in this appeal; \u2009nothing in our opinion affects Baldwin's conviction or sentence for that offense. \n \nFOOTNOTES \n \n1 .  \u2003Because Ruby, Kevin and Nicole Hobbs share the same surname, we refer to them by their first names in this opinion.

STERLING, ET AL., Respondents, v. TROY LONG, Appellant. \n WD 79063      Decided: January 17, 2017  Before Division Four: Mark D. Pfeiffer, Chief Judge, Presiding, Thomas H. Newton, Judge and Gary D. Witt, Judge \nTroy Lee Long (\u201cLong\u201d) appeals the entry of judgment against him by the Circuit Court of Jackson County in favor of Sterling Real Estate Acquisitions, LLC (\u201cSterling Acquisitions\u201d) and Steven Sterling (\u201cSterling\u201d and collectively \u201cthe Respondents\u201d) and granting the Respondents restitution of the premises and damages. Long raises three points on appeal. Long challenges the court's authority to grant the judgment (Point One) and argues that the Respondents failed to prove each element of the unlawful detainer action (Point Two) and that the court's decision was against the weight of the evidence (Point Three). We affirm. \n \nFactual Background\u20091 \n \nLong began residing at 901 SW Woods Chapel Road, Blue Springs, Missouri (\u201cthe Property\u201d) in late 2004 or early 2005. The Property originally belonged to his grandparents, and after their passing the Property was placed into the Villa De Alongi Trust (\u201cthe Trust\u201d), of which Long was a beneficiary. Within a year of Long taking up residence at the Property, his uncle Jerry Bridge (\u201cBridge\u201d) also began periodically residing at the Property. \n \nIn 2010, the Property was transferred out of the Trust and to Bridge. Following the transfer, both Long and Bridge continued to reside at the Property. There was no lease agreement, oral or written, between Bridge and Long at this time. In February of 2012, Sterling purchased the Property from Bridge through Sterling Acquisitions and leased the Property back to Bridge, which included an option for Bridge to re-purchase the Property. Even though the lease was between Sterling and Bridge, Sterling knew Long continued to reside at the Property and agreed that Long could still reside there so long as Bridge maintained his payments pursuant to the lease. \n \nBridge made payments under the lease for approximately two years. Bridge defaulted on payments in August of 2014, and on August 5, 2014 Bridge and Long were given notice to vacate the Property. Bridge had vacated the premises sometime in the middle of 2014, but Long continued to reside at the Property and still resided there at the time of trial in 2015. Respondents filed their Petition in December of 2014 and their Amended Petition in April of 2015 for unlawful detainer. The cause was tried to the court. The trial court issued its judgment against Long and in favor of the Respondents. The court awarded restitution of the premises to the Respondents and damages in the sum of $18,928.00 together with continuing damages in the sum of $1,352.00 per month until possession of the premises is restored to the Respondents. Long now appeals. \n \nStandard of Review \n \nAs in any court tried case, we review the trial court's judgment under the standard of review established in Murphy v. Carron, 536 S.W.2d 30, 32 (Mo. banc 1976). [Blue Ridge Bank & Trust Co. v. Trosen, 221 S.W.3d 451, 457 (Mo. App.W.D.2007) (\u201cTrosen I\u201d)\u2009] \u201cAccordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed unless it is not supported by substantial evidence, it is against the weight of the evidence, or it erroneously declares or applies the law.\u201d McNabb v. Barrett, 257 S.W.3d 166, 169 (Mo. App. W.D. 2008) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cWe view the evidence, and permissible inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the trial court's judgment, and we disregard all contrary evidence and inferences.\u201d Brown v. Mickelson, 220 S.W.3d 442, 447 (Mo. App. W.D. 2007) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cWe defer to the trial court's factual findings, giving due regard to the trial court's opportunity to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Id. (internal quotation omitted). This court \u201cis primarily concerned with the correctness of the trial court's result, not the route taken by the trial court to reach that result. Thus, the judgment will be affirmed if cognizable under any theory, regardless of whether the reasons advanced by the trial court are wrong or not sufficient.\u201d Trosen I, 221 S.W.3d at 457 (internal quotation and citation omitted). \n \nBlue Ridge Bank & Trust Co. v. Trosen, 309 S.W.3d 812, 815-16 (Mo. App. W.D. 2010). Whether the trial court had the authority to render a judgment in a particular case is an issue that this court reviews de novo. See Ground Freight Expeditors, LLC v. Binder, 359 S.W.3d 123, 126 (Mo. App. W.D. 2011). \n \nAnalysis \n \nPoint One \n \nIn Point One, Long argues that the trial court lacked authority, pursuant to section 534.300, 2 to enter its judgment against Long because he had been in continuous, peaceful, and uninterrupted possession and occupation of the Property for a period of more than three whole years immediately preceding the filing of the unlawful detainer action. \n \nThe Respondents' claim was brought pursuant to Chapter 534, which governs actions for unlawful detainer. Section 534.300 limits the ability to bring an action for unlawful detainer in certain circumstances. That section reads as follows: \n \nThe provisions of this chapter shall not extend to any person who has had the uninterrupted occupation or been in quiet possession of any lands or tenements for the space of three whole years together, immediately preceding the filing of the complaint, or who has continued three whole years in the peaceable possession after the time for which the premises were demised or let to him, or those under whom he claims, shall have expired. \n \nSection 534.300. Long argues that he has been residing on the Property continuously since at latest early 2005 and the action was brought against him in 2014, and, therefore, this statute bars the Respondents' action against him. The Respondents argue first that Long failed to file a responsive pleading and failed to raise section 534.300 as an affirmative defense and thus cannot be protected by the statute and, secondly, that the statute did not begin to run until Long was given notice to quit the Property. The court found that the three year period did not begin to run until Long was given notice to quit the Property and Long refused to vacate the premises. Therefore, the court concluded that the statute does not protect him as the requisite three-year period prior to the filing of the complaint had not accumulated. \n \nSection 534.300 is \n \npurely a statute of limitations, which, as it plainly states, precludes the maintenance of an action [for unlawful detainer] against one who has had the uninterrupted occupation or quiet possession of the premises for a period of three years immediately preceding the filing of the complaint, or who has continued in peaceable possession for three years after the expiration of the time for which the premises were let to him. \n \nP.M. Constr. Servs., Inc. v. Lewis, 26 S.W.3d 284, 290 (Mo. App. W.D. 2000) (quoting F.A. Sander Real Estate & Inv. Co. v. Becker, 202 S.W.2d 549, 551 (Mo. App. 1947)). \n \nIt has been repeatedly explained by our courts that section 534.300 does not begin to run while there is a landlord-tenant relationship but only after the tenant's refusal to give up possession to the landlord. See e.g., F.A. Sander Real Estate & Inv. Co., 202 S.W.2d at 551; Kohnen v. Hameed, 894 S.W.2d 196, 200 (Mo. App. E.D. 1995); P.M. Constr. Servs., Inc., 26 S.W.3d at 290. \n \nAt the expiration of a lease, it is the tenant's duty to surrender the premises, and when his time expires, he becomes an unlawful detainer. Grant v. White, 42 Mo. 285, 287 (1868). The tenant's uninterrupted possession is \u201cby and with the consent\u201d of the landlord. Id. At the point the landlord-tenant relationship terminates, the tenant's possession thereafter is adverse, which triggers the running of the three-year period described in § 534.300. \n \nP.M. Constr. Servs. Inc., 26 S.W.3d at 290. \n \nThe trial court made two findings regarding Long's tenancy. First, the court found that Long held possession of the Property under Bridge, presumably from 2010 when Bridge became the owner of the Property, until February of 2012 when Bridge sold the Property to the Respondents. Second, the court found that beginning in 2012 Bridge had a landlord-tenant relationship with Sterling, and that Long's \u201cpossession of the premises was with at least the oral permission of [Respondents]\u201d. Sterling testified that he agreed that Long could reside on the Property with Bridge so long as Bridge continued to make monthly payments. \n \nThe trial court was correct that pursuant to Section 534.300 an action for unlawful detainer does not begin to accrue until the possession of the premises by the occupant is adverse to the landowner. See Phelps v. Phelps, 299 S.W.3d 707, 710 (Mo. App. S.D. 2009) (An unlawful detainer does not begin until a tenancy is adverse to the landowner, i.e. without his or her consent). See also P.M. Constr. Servs. Inc., 26 S.W.3d at 290 (\u201cMore basically, it does not make sense for a statute of limitations clock to begin ticking before a cause of action accrues or a plaintiff is even known. The legislatively created remedy could be wiped out before the wrongful act happened\u201d). As stated above, Sterling testified that Long resided on the Property with his consent. We defer to the trial court's determinations of credibility and findings of fact. Trosen, 309 S.W.3d at 815-16. Long's tenancy did not become adverse to the Respondents until August of 2014. \n \nThat there was no written landlord-tenant agreement between Long and Sterling is inconsequential, as Long resided on the Property as a tenant under the lease executed by Bridge and with the consent of Sterling. This is sufficient to create a landlord-tenant relationship for the purposes of section 534.300. See Phelps, 299 S.W.3d at 710. In Phelps, a son and daughter-in-law lived in a residence owned by the son's mother for almost twenty-five years. Id. at 708. In that case, it appears that there was no formal lease and the operative fact on appeal was that the son and daughter-in-law lived at the premises with the consent of the mother. Id. at 710. The court held that the unlawful detainer statute of limitations could not begin to run until the mother had withdrawn her consent. Id. \n \nBridge and Long contemporaneously received notice to quit the Property in August of 2014, at which time Long's possession of the Property became adverse and the limitations period of section 534.300 began to run. As the petition was filed in December of 2014, Long cannot be protected by section 534.300. Because we have found that the trial court correctly concluded that the limitations period within section 534.300 had not expired under the facts of this case, we need not decide whether Long could have relied upon the statute given his failure to file a responsive pleading and raise section 534.300 as an affirmative defense or whether this issue was tried by consent. \n \nPoint One is denied. \n \nPoints Two and Three \n \nAs Points Two and Three are related, we will consider them together. In Point Two, Long argues the trial court misapplied the law in granting judgment for restitution and damages in favor of the Respondents because they failed to prove each and every element of their unlawful detainer action against him in that they failed to present any evidence that Long committed any of the acts or omissions set forth in section 534.030 that would cause him to be guilty of an \u201cunlawful detainer.\u201d In Point Three, Long argues that the trial court's decision that Long committed any of the acts or omissions set forth in section 534.030 is against the weight of the evidence. \n \nSection 534.030.1 provides, as relevant to this appeal, that \n \n[w]hen any person willfully and without force holds over any lands, tenements or other possessions, after the termination of the time for which they were demised or let to the person, or the person under whom such person claims [ \u2024 ] and after demand made, in writing, for the delivery of such possession of the premises by the person having the legal right to such possession [ \u2024 ] shall refuse or neglect to vacate such possession, such person is guilty of an \u201cunlawful detainer.\u201d \n \nThis section has been described as applying to hold-over tenants. See P.M. Constr. Services, Inc. v. Lewis, 26 S.W.3d at 288. \n \nAlthough Long vociferously argues that he was not a tenant, as already found in Point One, the evidence supports the trial court's finding that Long resided at the Property pursuant to the lease executed by Bridge and with the permission of Sterling. Section 534.030 clearly states that any person who holds over possession of property let to him \u201cor the person under whom such person claims\u201d may be guilty of an unlawful detainer. Long clearly falls within this class as he resided as a tenant on the Property under the lease executed by Bridge with Sterling's consent until August of 2014, after which time Long became a hold-over tenant when he refused to quit the Property. Long does not argue that the Respondents failed to satisfy any other requirement to sustain their claim for unlawful detainer. The trial court did not misapply the law, and the trial court's finding that Long refused to quit the Property after the lease under which he had possession of the Property was terminated and after having received notice from Respondents demanding that he do so was not against the weight of the evidence. \n \nPoints Two and Three are denied. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe judgment of the circuit court is affirmed. \n \nFOOTNOTES \n \n1 .  \u2003We view the evidence, and permissible inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the trial court's judgment, and we disregard all contrary evidence and inferences.

WD 79073      Decided: January 24, 2017  Before Division One: \u2009Anthony Rex Gabbert, P.J., and Thomas H. Newton and Alok Ahuja, JJ.Ashley M. Barton and Nikola S. Smith, KCMO, for appellant. Michael L. Belancio, KCMO, for respondent. \nIn 2005, the City of Kansas City filed suit against Daniel J. Ross in the Circuit Court of Jackson County to recover past-due City profits taxes. The City obtained a default judgment against Ross in 2005. When the City sought to execute on the default judgment in 2015, Ross filed a motion to set aside the default judgment, alleging that he had never been properly served with process. The circuit court granted Ross' motion to set aside the default judgment, and set the case for trial. On the morning of trial, the circuit court dismissed the action on the basis that, as of that time, the City had still not properly served Ross. \n \nThe City appeals. The circuit court's dismissal of the action is presumed to be without prejudice pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 67.03. Because the City is free to re-file its tax-collection suit, and properly serve Ross in that new lawsuit, we conclude that the dismissal of the present action without prejudice is not appealable. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. \n \nFactual Background \n \nOn April 8, 2005, the City sued Ross for past-due City profits taxes for the 2001, 2002, and 2003 tax years. The City sought to recover past-due taxes of $3,900.60, as well as $896.75 in prejudgment interest, and $975.15 in penalties, for a total of $5,772.50 as of the date the petition was filed. Ross asserts that no taxes were owed because he had agreed to a payment plan with the City, and satisfied the terms of that payment plan. \n \nA summons was issued on April 11, 2005, and returned non est. An alias summons was later issued, although the City and Ross dispute the date on which that occurred. A special process server's return indicates that the alias summons was personally served on Ross on October 8, 2005. \n \nThe return of service states that Ross was served at 701 Westport Road #\u2009131 in Kansas City. Ross denies that he was personally served at that place and time, and contends that although he was previously a resident of the 701 Westport Road address, he had moved out of that location over ten years earlier. \n \nRoss did not appear in response to the City's petition, and a default judgment was entered against him on October 26, 2005. \n \nIn February 2015, the City attempted to execute on the 2005 default judgment by serving a writ of garnishment on UMB Bank (it had apparently made no earlier collection efforts). In response to the City's efforts to execute on the judgment, Ross filed a Motion to Set Aside the default judgment on March 23, 2015. \n \nIn his Motion to Set Aside, Ross argued that the default judgment was void ab initio because the Circuit Court did not have personal jurisdiction over him, because he had not been served with process in 2005. Ross' Motion also alleged that he had a meritorious defense to the underlying tax-collection action, because he had entered a payment plan with a City tax-collection employee in 2005, and had satisfied the terms of that payment plan, in full satisfaction of his tax liability for the years in question. \n \nOn April 1, 2015, nine days after the filing of Ross' Motion to Set Aside, the City filed a motion for an extension of time to respond, asserting that it had not yet received a copy of the underlying case file from the court, and could not respond to Ross' Motion without that file. That same day, the court issued an order granting Ross' Motion and setting aside the 2005 default judgment. \n \nOn April 27, 2015, the City filed a Motion to Reconsider the order setting aside the default judgment. The Motion to Reconsider argued that, based on the special process server's return of service, Ross was indeed personally served at 701 Westport Road on October 8, 2005. The City also argued that the circuit court had erroneously granted Ross' Motion to Set Aside before the City's time to respond had expired. The City argued that, if it had been given an adequate opportunity to respond, it \u201cwould have presented the evidence and arguments\u201d presented in the Motion to Reconsider. \n \nAlso on April 27, Ross filed an Answer to the City's original 2005 Petition. In his Answer, Ross asserted, among other things, that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over him due to the City's failure to properly serve him with process. \n \nThe circuit court conducted a hearing on the City's Motion to Reconsider, at which it heard argument of counsel. It then denied reconsideration. The court set the case for a bench trial on August 28, 2015. \n \nOn August 28, Ross filed a Motion in Limine which argued, among other things, that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over him due to the City's continued failure to serve him with process. Ross argued that, because of the City's failure to properly serve him, the action should be dismissed. After verifying with the City's counsel that the City had not served Ross since the entry of the court's April 1 order setting aside the default judgment, the circuit court ordered that the action be dismissed. It entered a judgment of dismissal on the same date. \n \nThe City appeals. \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe City raises four Points on appeal. It first argues that the circuit court erred in setting aside the 2005 default judgment, because the court denied the City due process by ruling on Ross' Motion to Set Aside without giving the City an adequate opportunity to respond. The City then argues that the court's dismissal of the action was erroneous because Ross had waived any objection to service of process, and because Ross' Motion in Limine was not a proper procedural vehicle to raise the service of process issue. \n \n\u201cIn every case before considering claims raised on appeal, this Court has a duty to sua sponte determine whether we have authority to decide the appeal.\u201d Collector of Revenue of City of St. Louis v. Parcels of Land Encumbered with Delinquent Tax Liens, 350 S.W.3d 840, 841 (Mo. App. E.D. 2011) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \n \nWith exceptions which are not relevant here, \n \n[o]ur jurisdiction depends upon the existence of a final judgment. Absent a final judgment, we lack jurisdiction and must dismiss the appeal. To constitute a final judgment, the judgment appealed from normally must dispose of all issues and all parties in the case and leave nothing for future determination. \n \nCare and Treatment of Bowles v. State, 83 S.W.3d 93, 94 (Mo. App. W.D. 2002) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \n \nThe circuit court's judgment in this case dismissed the City's petition, without specifying whether the dismissal was with, or without, prejudice to refiling. Rule 67.03 specifies that \u201c[a]ny involuntary dismissal shall be without prejudice unless the court in its order for dismissal shall otherwise specify.\u201d Because the circuit court's judgment did not specify that dismissal was with prejudice, it is deemed to be a dismissal without prejudice by virtue of Rule 67.03. \n \nThe general rule is that a dismissal without prejudice is not a final judgment and, therefore, is not appealable. Ordinarily, when an action is dismissed without prejudice, a plaintiff may cure the dismissal by filing another suit in the same court. An exception to this general rule is that an appeal can be taken where the dismissal has the practical effect of terminating the litigation in the form cast by the plaintiff. \n \nHutcheson v. Elec. Data Access Techs., Inc., 327 S.W.3d 622, 625 (Mo. App. E.D. 2010) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \n \nIn this case, the deficiencies in service of process which led the circuit court to dismiss the petition could be cured by the City in a refiled action. For this reason, the dismissal of a petition without prejudice for defects in service of process is generally held not to be a final judgment subject to immediate appeal. See, e.g., Turnbow v. S. Ry. Co., 768 S.W.2d 556, 558 (Mo. banc 1989) (holding that dismissal without prejudice for insufficient service of process was not appealable; \u2009\u201cA dismissal without prejudice which the plaintiff may cure by filing another suit in the same court, is not a final judgment from which an appeal may be taken under Missouri law because it lacks the hallmarks of a final judgment\u2014it fails to dispose of all the issues and parties to the cause of action.\u201d); \u2009Snelling v. Segbers, 450 S.W.3d 493, 496 (Mo. App. E.D. 2014) (citing Manzella v. Dorsey, 258 S.W.3d 501, 503 (Mo. App. E.D. 2008)). \n \nIf the plaintiff would be barred from refiling the suit due to the statute of limitations, then a dismissal without prejudice may be deemed final because it has the practical effect of terminating the litigation. Hutcheson, 327 S.W.3d at 625; \u2009Doe v. Visionaire Corp., 13 S.W.3d 674, 676 (Mo. App. E.D. 2000). \n \nIn this case, the statute of limitations would not prevent the City from refiling its tax-collection action. The City's lawsuit to collect unpaid profits taxes was subject to the five-year statute of limitations in §\u2002516.120, RSMo. See Stoner v. Dir. of Revenue, 358 S.W.3d 514, 518 (Mo. App. W.D. 2011); \u2009State ex rel. Lohman v. Black, 980 S.W.2d 41, 43 (Mo. App. W.D. 1998); \u2009State ex rel. and to Use of Collector of Revenue of City of St. Louis v. Robertson, 417 S.W.2d 699, 700 (Mo. App. 1967). The City's 200 lawsuit was timely, since it sought to collect taxes for the 2001 through 2003 tax years. Accordingly, under the \u201csavings statute,\u201d §\u2002516.230, RSMo, the City would have one year from the involuntary dismissal of its 2005 action in which to refile. See Molder v. Trammel Crow Servs., Inc., 309 S.W.3d 837, 841\u201342 (Mo. App. W.D. 2010); \u2009In re Estate of Klaas, 8 S.W.3d 906, 909 (Mo. App. S.D. 2000); \u2009Litton v. Rhudy, 886 S.W.2d 191, 193 (Mo. App. W.D. 1994). The one-year refiling period provided by §\u2002516.230, RSMo did not begin to run during the pendency of this appeal. Adams v. St. Louis\u2013San Francisco Ry. Co., 326 Mo. 1006, 33 S.W.2d 944, 946 (1930) (interpreting similarly worded predecessor statute; \u2009\u201c[The plaintiff] suffered no final disposition of his suit so long as his appeal from the court's refusal to set aside the nonsuit was pending.\u201d). Therefore, the City will have one year from the conclusion of this appeal within which to refile its tax-collection action, and the statute of limitations would not present an obstacle to the City refiling its petition. \n \nBecause the service of process defects could be cured in a new lawsuit, and because that lawsuit would not be barred by the statute of limitations, the circuit court's dismissal of the City's 2005 action without prejudice did not have the practical effect of terminating the litigation, and it is therefore not an appealable final judgment. \n \nWe recognize that, besides challenging the circuit court's dismissal of its petition, the City on appeal has also argued that the circuit court erroneously set aside the default judgment entered in 2005. The City's challenge to the order granting Ross' Motion to Set Aside the default judgment does not alter our analysis of appellate jurisdiction. \u201cA motion to set aside a default judgment is an \u2018independent action,\u2019 and, therefore, a judgment granting or denying such a motion is a final judgment eligible for immediate appellate review.\u201d Cook v. Griffitts, 498 S.W.3d 855, 858 (Mo. App. W.D. 2016) (citation omitted). The City did not separately appeal from the circuit court's April 1, 2015 ruling granting Ross' Motion to Set Aside the default judgment. The circuit court's April 1 ruling was not reflected in a document denominated a \u201cjudgment,\u201d as required by Rule 74.01(a), and it therefore may not have been appealable at that time. Id. Because it was based on a lack of personal jurisdiction due to defective service of process, however, the trial court's April 1 order setting aside the default judgment gave the trial court authority to dispose of the merits of the case, and the ruling setting aside the default judgment may have been reviewable as part of an appealable final judgment otherwise entered in the action. Griffin v. Kandi Techs. Corp., 454 S.W.3d 341, 349\u201350 (Mo. App. S.D. 2014). As we have concluded above, no appealable final judgment has been entered here. \n \nIn any event, even if we were to address the merits of the City's challenge to the order setting aside the default judgment, the City would not be entitled to relief. Its only argument challenging the April 1, 2015 order setting aside the default judgment is that the trial court ruled on Ross' Motion to Set Aside prematurely, before the City had an adequate opportunity to respond. The City filed a motion to reconsider the April 1 order, however, in which it presented all of the evidence and arguments which it claimed it would have presented prior to entry of the April 1 order if given an adequate response time. The circuit court considered the City's Motion to Reconsider, and denied it. As the City conceded at oral argument, in these circumstances there is no basis in the record to conclude that a different result would have been reached if the City had initially been given additional time to respond to Ross' Motion to Set Aside. Therefore, even if the circuit court initially denied the City the response period to which it was entitled, any error in that regard was not prejudicial and would not justify reversal. See Snelling v. Segbers, 450 S.W.3d 493, 496 n.2 (Mo. App. E.D. 2014) (rejecting similar argument where the appellant \u201cwas given the opportunity to present any additional evidence\u201d after entry of the trial court's order finding service of process to be insufficient). \n \nConclusion \n \nThe appeal is dismissed. \n \nAlok Ahuja, Judge \n \nAll concur.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Kansas City news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"City of Kansas City, Missouri, Appellant, v.

CHARLES J. DYKHOUSE, BOONE COUNTY COUNSELOR, in his official capacity, Respondent, v. CITY OF COLUMBIA, MISSOURI, Appellant. \n WD 79352      Decided: January 17, 2017  Before Division Two: Lisa White Hardwick, Presiding Judge, and Karen King Mitchell and Anthony Rex Gabbert, Judges \nCharles J. Dykhouse filed a petition in quo warranto, purportedly in his capacity as Boone County Counselor, seeking to oust the City of Columbia from engaging in any tax increment financing (TIF) projects for a minimum of five years. Dykhouse argued that, while engaged in previous TIF projects, City violated the statutory reporting requirements for municipalities engaging in TIFs and, therefore, lost its authority to continue engaging in TIF projects by operation of law. Despite numerous objections, writ petitions, and dispositive motions from City arguing that Dykhouse lacked authority to file a quo warranto action and that the alleged violations did not fall within the purview of quo warranto proceedings, the circuit court nonetheless entered a judgment of ouster, prohibiting City \u201cfrom implementing any new tax increment finance project \u2024 through December 31, 2019.\u201d Because Dykhouse lacked authority to seek quo warranto and because City's alleged violation is not the proper subject for a quo warranto proceeding, we reverse the decision of the trial court with instructions to dismiss the petition. \n \nBackground \n \nA. The TIF Act, §§ 99.800-99.865\u20091 \n \n\u201cThe TIF Act authorizes a city to undertake a redevelopment project under certain conditions laid out in Section 99.810.\u201d State ex rel. City of Desloge v. St. Francois Cty., 245 S.W.3d 855, 858 (Mo. App. E.D. 2007). \u201cFunds for the redevelopment project come essentially from the future increase in the value of the land once the redevelopment project is complete.\u201d Id. \u201cThe TIF Act calls for the city implementing the plan to create a TIF Commission to formulate the plan and oversee its implementation.\u201d Id. \u201cThe Commission's actions are subject to the final approval of the governing body of the municipality.\u201d Id. \u201cThe Commission's recommendations go into effect upon the municipality's adoption of them by ordinance or resolution.\u201d Id. \u201cOnce the redevelopment plan is in place, the municipality begins to accumulate funding in a special allocation fund.\u201d Id. \u201cEach year that the post-plan assessed value of the taxable real property within the redevelopment project area exceeds the pre-plan assessed value, property taxes on the increase in value are abated.\u201d Id. \u201cInstead of paying taxes, the landowners make payments in lieu of taxes equal to the amount the taxes would have been after improvements.\u201d Id. \u201cThose payments go into the special allocation fund.\u201d Id. \n \nUnder § 99.865, municipalities engaging in TIF projects have certain reporting obligations regarding the status of each redevelopment plan and project. Before 2009, the statute was silent regarding any penalty for noncompliance. But, in 2009, § 99.865.7 was enacted, and it provided: \u201cAny municipality which fails to comply with the reporting requirements provided in this section shall be prohibited from implementing any new tax increment finance project for a period of no less than five years from such municipality's failure to comply.\u201d 2009 Mo. Laws 379 (HB 191). \n \nB. City's TIF projects and quo warranto proceedings \n \nBeginning in 2009, under the authority of the TIF Act, City engaged in the creation of three separate TIF projects\u2014the 10th and Locust Redevelopment Plan, the Tiger Hotel Redevelopment Plan, and the Regency Hotel Redevelopment Plan. The 10th and Locust Redevelopment Plan was never constructed, but both the Tiger Hotel and the Regency Hotel Redevelopment Plans were substantially complete and in operation by 2014. In December 2013, City began an evaluation to determine whether to establish an additional TIF district in central Columbia, and it performed a cost-benefit analysis to determine feasibility. \n \nOn January 24, 2014, the Boone County Commission (Commission) sent a letter to City via the city council (Council), formally requesting City to abandon any efforts to create a downtown TIF district. The Commission identified various concerns and asked to be included in a discussion of possible alternative solutions. The Commission's letter closed by expressing a desire \u201cto avoid a needless and costly legal battle regarding Columbia's ability to implement any new tax increment financing projects due to its failures to provide required, annual reporting on its existing TIF efforts.\u201d The Commission requested that City \u201cterminate the TIF effort currently underway\u201d and confirm its intent to do so no later than January 31, 2014. \n \nOn February 6, 2014, Dykhouse, purportedly acting ex officio as the Boone County Counselor, filed a petition in quo warranto, naming City as Respondent, seeking a \u201c[j]udgment of [q]uo [w]arranto finding that [City, via the operation of § 99.865.7] lacks the authority it is usurping to itself by attempting to engage in a new TIF project[ and] ordering that such lack of authority will persist through at least December 31, 2017.\u201d Dykhouse alleged that his authority to file the petition derived from § 56.640.3. \n \nOn February 17, 2014, City abandoned its effort to create the central Columbia TIF district, and as of April 2014, City was no longer pursuing the formation of any TIF district within its borders. \n \nIn response to Dykhouse's petition, City repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, argued in dispositive motions and writ petitions that Dykhouse, as County Counselor, lacked standing to bring a quo warranto action, that quo warranto did not lie under the facts alleged, and that the issue was not ripe in light of the fact that City had abandoned its only effort to create a new TIF district. The trial court rejected City's arguments and entered findings of fact and conclusions of law, determining that City had repeatedly violated its reporting obligations under § 99.865 and was, therefore, \u201cprohibited from implementing any new tax increment finance project for a period of no less than five (5) years from the last violation of the reporting requirements of RSMo §\u200299.865, or through December 31, 2019.\u201d City appeals. \n \nAnalysis \n \nCity brings nine points on appeal. In its first point, City argues that the trial court erred in finding the matter ripe for review in light of the facts that City had abandoned its only existing effort to create a new TIF district and had no new plans in the works. In its second point, City argues that the trial court erred in finding that quo warranto was the appropriate vehicle for Dykhouse's challenge, as City had the power to create TIF districts and, therefore, was not a usurper. In its third and fourth points, City argues that Dykhouse, as a County Counselor, either lacked standing to bring a quo warranto action or failed to prove necessary facts to establish standing. In its fifth and sixth points, City challenges the trial court's determination that City violated its reporting obligations. In its seventh and eighth points, City challenges the admission of certain evidence as beyond the scope of the pleadings. And in its ninth and final point, City argues that the trial court erred in finding that the most recent violation occurred on December 31, 2014. Because we find the second and third points dispositive, we do not reach City's remaining points. \n \nA. Dykhouse lacked authority to bring a quo warranto action. \n \nIn its third point on appeal, City argues that Dykhouse lacked \u201cstanding\u201d to bring a quo warranto action because (among other reasons) he is neither the Attorney General nor the county prosecutor. We find that Dykhouse had no authority to bring a quo warranto action. \n \n\u201c[A]ppellate review of whether a party has standing to sue is conducted de novo.\u201d Exec. Bd. of Mo. Baptist Convention v. Carnahan, 170 S.W.3d 437, 445 (Mo. App. W.D. 2005). \u201cThe question of standing is determined as a matter of law, based upon the petition \u2018along with any other non-contested facts accepted as true by the parties at the time the motion to dismiss was argued.\u2019\u2009\u201d Id. (quoting Inman v. Mo. Dep't of Corr., 139 S.W.3d 180, 184 (Mo. App. W.D. 2004)). \u201cThe question of standing is a threshold issue.\u201d Id. \u201cA party cannot obtain relief from a court if that party lacks standing.\u201d Id. (quoting Cont'l Coal, Inc. v. Mo. Land Reclamation Comm'n, 150 S.W.3d 371, 378 (Mo. App. W.D. 2004)). \n \nWhen Dykhouse filed the petition, he purportedly did so on personal information. 2 Rule 98.02, 3 at the time the petition was filed in 2014, provided that, when based upon personal information, \u201c[a]ny of the following may be relators [in a proceeding for quo warranto]: \u2024 [t]he attorney general of this state \u2024 or \u2024 [t]he prosecuting attorney.\u201d But Dykhouse was neither the Attorney General nor the prosecuting attorney. As County Counselor, he did not fall within the purview of proper relators under Rule 98.02. See State ex rel. St. Charles Cty. Counselor v. City of O'Fallon, 53 S.W.3d 211, 213-14 (Mo. App. E.D. 2001) (noting that a county counselor constituted a private relator and, therefore, could prosecute an action in quo warranto \u201conly \u2024 if the Attorney General or the prosecuting attorney authorize[d] the action.\u201d). \n \nIn the petition, however, Dykhouse invoked the authority of § 56.640.3. That statute provides, \n \nNotwithstanding any law to the contrary, the county counselor in any county of the first classification and the prosecuting attorney of such county may by mutual cooperation agreement prosecute or defend any civil action which the prosecuting attorney or county counselor of the county is authorized or required by law to prosecute or defend. \n \nDykhouse argued that he and the Boone County Prosecutor had entered a mutual cooperation agreement and that Dykhouse was, therefore, authorized\u2014by virtue of the county prosecutor's authority under Rule 98.02\u2014to bring a quo warranto action. In support of his argument, Dykhouse presented the following affidavit to the trial court from the Boone County Prosecutor: \n \nTabular or graphical material not displayable at this time. \n \nDykhouse presented no further evidence regarding the date, nature, or scope of the agreement. 4 \n \nThe question then is, to the extent that § 56.640.3 is inconsistent with Rule 98.02 as to who may be a relator in a quo warranto action, whether Rule 98.02 or § 56.640.3 controls. We have found no case law regarding the interplay between Rule 98.02, as it existed in 2014, and § 56.640.3. The City of O'Fallon case cited above did not involve any alleged mutual cooperation agreements between the county counselor and the county prosecutor. Rather, the county counselor in that case argued that its authority derived from the county's charter, which provided that \u201cthe County Counselor shall have \u2024 the authority to file an action in quo warranto.\u201d City of O'Fallon, 53 S.W.3d at 213. The Eastern District rejected the argument, finding that, regardless of the county's charter provision, \u201cthe Counselor was still required to comply with Rule 98.02 and Section 531.010,[ 5 ] which govern proceedings in Quo Warranto.\u201d Id. at 214. \n \nThe Missouri Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he supreme court may establish rules relating to practice, procedure and pleading for all courts and administrative tribunals, which shall have the force and effect of law[,]\u201d but \u201c[t]he rules shall not change substantive rights.\u201d Mo. Const. art. V, § 5. Therefore, if there is an inconsistency on a substantive issue between a statute and a rule, the statute controls. On the other hand, if a rule is procedural in nature, it will control unless expressly modified by the legislature under limited circumstances discussed infra. Dykhouse argues that \u201cThe class of potential plaintiffs entitled to bring a Quo Warranto action is a substantive right, not a procedural matter,\u201d and, therefore, § 56.640.3, which arguably expands those who may act as a relator to include a county counselor who has entered into a mutual cooperation agreement with a county prosecutor, controls. Thus, a threshold question we must answer before determining what effect, if any, § 56.640.3 has on Rule 98.02, is whether the Rule is procedural or substantive. \n \nThough the parties discuss Rule 98.02 in terms of whether it provides Dykhouse with \u201cstanding\u201d to seek quo warranto, the concept of \u201cstanding\u201d differs slightly from the purpose of Rule 98.02. \u201cStanding is a question of whether \u2018the parties seeking relief \u2024 have some personal interest at stake in the dispute.\u2019\u2009\u201d State ex rel. Collector of Winchester v. Jamison, 357 S.W.3d 589, 594 (Mo. banc 2012) (quoting Ste. Genevieve Sch. Dist. R-II v. Bd. of Alderman of the City of Ste. Genevieve, 66 S.W.3d 6, 10 (Mo. banc 2002)). But what Rule 98.02 provides to the named permissible relators is \u201cnot [a] personal interest in the proceedings,\u201d but rather \u201cauthority or qualification to sue.\u201d Id. at 595. \n \nProcedural law prescribes a method of enforcing rights or obtaining redress for their invasion; substantive law creates, defines and regulates rights; the distinction between substantive law and procedural law is that substantive law relates to the rights and duties giving rise to the cause of action, while procedural law is the machinery used for carrying on the suit. \n \nId. (quoting Wilkes v. Mo. Highway and Transp. Comm'n, 762 S.W.2d 27, 28 (Mo. banc 1988)). Rules \u201cdealing merely \u2018with the means by which the parties may assert their underlying rights,\u2019 but not otherwise defining \u2018the nature or the extent of the underlying rights,\u2019 are procedural.\u201d Id. (quoting State ex rel. K.C. v. Gant, 661 S.W.2d 483, 485 (Mo. banc 1983)). \n \nIn Jamison, the Court had to determine whether a statute, § 71.675, which purported to preclude \u201ccities and towns from serving as class representatives in suits to enforce or collect business license taxes imposed on telecommunications companies,\u201d was procedural or substantive. 6 Id. at 590, 594. The respondent argued that § 71.675 was related to standing, which was a substantive issue. Id. at 594. But the Missouri Supreme Court disagreed, noting that \u201c[w]hat section 71.675 purports to take from cities and towns \u2024 is not \u2024 their standing to sue but rather their right to do so as a representative of other cities and towns in suits against telecommunications companies.\u201d Id. at 595. The Court held that, \u201c[a]s a statute governing the \u2018machinery [to be] used for carrying on the suit,\u2019 and prescribing the means by which cities and towns may assert their rights, [Missouri Supreme] Court [\u2009] precedent instructs that section 71.675 is procedural.\u201d Id. (quoting Wilkes, 762 S.W.2d at 28) (internal citation omitted). \n \nThe same is true here. When either the Attorney General or a prosecuting attorney acts ex officio to bring a quo warranto action, it is not to remedy a personal interest, but instead is done \u201cby virtue of the power of his [or her] office\u201d in order to \u201cserve the public interest.\u201d City of Lake St. Louis v. City of O'Fallon, 324 S.W.3d 756, 760 (Mo. banc 2010) (quoting State ex inf. Graham v. Hurley, 540 S.W.2d 20, 22 (Mo. banc 1976)). In other words, the rule addresses \u201cmerely \u2018\u2024 the means by which \u2024 underlying rights'\u2009\u201d may be asserted, but it does not define \u201cthe nature or the extent of the underlying rights.\u201d Jamison, 357 S.W.3d at 595 (quoting Gant, 661 S.W.2d at 485). Thus, Rule 98.02's identification of permissible relators is procedural. \n \nSimply characterizing a rule as procedural, however, does not insulate it from subsequent legislative action. \u201cThe very constitutional provision giving th[e Missouri Supreme] Court the authority to establish procedural rules that have the force and effect of law also provides the legislature with a specific mechanism for modifying those rules by providing that \u2018[a]ny rule may be annulled or amended in whole or in part by a law limited to the purpose.\u2019\u2009\u201d Id. at 592 (quoting Mo. Const. art. V, § 5). \u201cAlthough the legislature thereby is given the authority to annul or amend procedural rules created by the Court, \u2018[t]he constitutional prescription of the manner in which the General Assembly must act is of pristine importance.\u2019\u2009\u201d Id. (quoting Gant, 661 S.W.2d at 485). \u201cA law, to qualify as one limited to the purpose of amending or annulling a rule, must[: (1)\u2009] refer expressly to the rule and [\u2009(2)\u2009] be limited to the purpose of amending or annulling it.\u201d Id. (internal quotations omitted). \n \nThe 2014 version of Rule 98.02 became effective on January 1, 1994, thus predating the enactment of § 56.640.3 in 2003. But § 56.640 makes no mention of Rule 98.02 and is unquestionably broader in application than Rule 98.02, given that it permits county counselors to \u201cprosecute or defend any civil action which the prosecuting attorney \u2024 is authorized \u2024 to prosecute or defend.\u201d § 56.640.3 (emphasis added). Thus, given that the legislature did not follow the constitutionally mandated steps to amend Rule 98.02 in enacting § 56.640.3, it is evident that altering the list of permissible relators in quo warranto actions was not the legislative intent behind § 56.640.3. 7 Accordingly, regardless of whether Dykhouse met his burden of establishing the existence of a mutual cooperation agreement under § 56.640.3, such an agreement would not have provided him with the authority to bring a quo warranto action in his own name. 8 \n \nThough Dykhouse did not fall within Rule 98.02's list of proper relators at the time he filed his petition, the Rule has since been amended. On June 10, 2015, Rule 98.02 was amended to include county counselors in the list of approved relators for quo warranto actions, and the amended Rule became effective on January 1, 2016\u2014after the judgment was entered below but before City filed its notice of appeal. Dykhouse argues that the amendment of the Rule simply clarifies the Court's intent that county counselors have the ability to seek quo warranto. We disagree. \n \nQuo warranto proceedings, designed to protect the public interest, are an exercise of the police power of the state. See State ex rel. Rouveyrol v. Donnelly, 285 S.W.2d 669, 674 (Mo. banc 1956) (noting that the police power includes the power to enact laws promoting order and the general welfare of society). This power cannot be delegated to private persons, and \u201c[a] person, official or private, can have no greater part in the exercise of the police power than is accorded him by law.\u201d Id. \n \nThough amended Rule 98.02 would now allow Dykhouse, as County Counselor, to seek quo warranto in his own name, a relator in a quo warranto proceeding \u201cmust have that authority before he may proceed.\u201d State ex rel. Schneider's Credit Jewelers v. Brackman, 272 S.W.2d 289, 296 (Mo. banc 1954) (emphasis added). This is because the existence of a proper relator \u201cis a jurisdictional requirement\u201d in a quo warranto proceeding. State ex inf. Joyce-Hayes v. Twenty-Second Judicial Circuit, 864 S.W.2d 396, 399 (Mo. App. E.D. 1993). In other words, to invoke the jurisdiction of the circuit court to decide a quo warranto action, the relator filing the petition must have the authority to do so at the outset of the proceedings. See Lee v. Jamison, 338 S.W.3d 844, 846 (Mo. App. E.D. 2011) (holding that \u201c[t]he lower court lacked jurisdiction to hear th[e] case because it was filed without proper authority.\u201d). \n \nContrary to Dykhouse's argument, the change in Rule 98.02 does not clarify a preexisting intent for county counselors to have the authority to bring quo warranto actions; rather, \u201cthis amendment is \u2018a significant factor\u2019 and highly persuasive that the prior law did not contemplate that [county counselors] were parties to the proceedings.\u201d Rouveyrol, 285 S.W.2d at 677 (emphasis added) (quoting State ex inf. Gentry v. Long-Bell Lumber Co., 12 S.W.2d 64, 80 (Mo. banc 1928)). \u201cThe specific provision of the amendment that\u201d county counselors be allowed to serve as relator in a quo warranto action \u201cis a legislative construction that the right did not exist under the law applicable to this case.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). \u201cIn interpreting [rules], we employ the same rules of construction that we use when interpreting statutes.\u201d State ex rel. Office of Pub. Counsel v. Missouri Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 301 S.W.3d 556, 565 (Mo. App. W.D. 2009). \n \nIn sum, because neither the applicable version of Rule 98.02 nor § 56.640.3 granted county counselors authority to seek quo warranto at the time Dykhouse filed his petition, the trial court's jurisdiction was never properly invoked, and this case should have been dismissed. \n \nPoint III is granted. The trial court's decision is reversed, and the matter is remanded with instructions to dismiss. \n \nB. Quo warranto does not lie to prevent an improper exercise of power lawfully possessed. \n \nAlthough our resolution of City's third point fully disposes of the appeal, because county counselors are now authorized relators in quo warranto proceedings, we find it necessary to further address City's second point, wherein it contends that quo warranto does not lie under the facts of this case, as the issue may arise again. \n \nQuo warranto proceedings are governed by § 531.010 and Rule 98. The statute and Rule provide for the remedy of ouster \u201c[i]n case any person shall usurp, intrude into or unlawfully hold or execute any office or franchise.\u201d § 531.010. Dykhouse alleged that City, by taking steps to create a TIF, was \u201cusurping to itself a power it [did] not possess,\u201d on the theory that City's existing \u201cpower to implement new TIF programs [was] removed by operation of state law, pursuant to RSMo § 99.865.\u201d In other words, Dykhouse argues that the penalty provided by § 99.865.7 is self-executing and automatically applied to remove City's authority to implement new TIF programs for a period of at least five years, upon its failure to comply with the reporting obligations imposed in § 99.865. \n \nAccepting\u2014without deciding\u2014the validity of the alleged reporting violations, there are still two flaws with Dykhouse's theory: first, the penalty provision of § 99.865.7 is not self-executing; and second, quo warranto lies to correct only a usurpation of authority where none is granted\u2014it does not lie to correct the unlawful exercise of existing authority. \n \nTo begin, a \u201cprovision \u2024 is self-executing if it supplies a sufficient rule by means of which the \u2024 duty which it imposes may be enforced, without the aid of\u201d additional legislation or intervention. State ex rel. City of Fulton v. Smith, 194 S.W.2d 302, 304 (Mo. banc 1946) (quoting 11 Am. Jur. Constitutional Law, § 74, at 691, 692). In other words, a \u201cprovision is self-executing if there is nothing to be done \u2024 to put it in operation.\u201d Id. (quoting 11 Am. Jur. Constitutional Law, § 74, at 691, 692). \n \nAn example of a self-executing provision properly subject to a quo warranto action is the constitutional prohibition on nepotism found in Article VII, § 6 of the Missouri Constitution: \n \nAny public officer or employee in this state who by virtue of his office or employment names or appoints to public office or employment any relative within the fourth degree, by consanguinity or affinity, shall thereby forfeit his office or employment. \n \nUnder this provision, a public officer \u201cforfeits by the act forbidden, and therefore his act results in a status\u201d\u2014that of interloper. State ex inf. Norman v. Ellis, 28 S.W.2d 363, 366 (Mo. banc 1930). When a provision is self-executing, \u201cquo warranto is an appropriate remedy for enforcing a resulting forfeiture.\u201d State ex rel. Nixon v. Belt, 873 S.W.2d 644, 646 (Mo. App. W.D. 1994). \n \nHere, however, § 99.865.7 is not self-executing. Even if a municipality fails to comply with the reporting requirements, it does not automatically acquire the status of interloper. This can be seen in the plain language of § 99.865.7. The statute provides that \u201c[a]ny municipality which fails to comply with the reporting requirements \u2024 shall be prohibited from implementing any new tax increment finance project for a period of no less than five years from such municipality's failure to comply.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Unlike the active voice used in Article VII, § 6, of the Missouri Constitution indicating that a public officer \u201cforfeits\u201d his or her office by certain acts, § 99.865.7 uses passive voice (\u201cshall be prohibited\u201d), indicating that an outside force must act upon a municipality before the power to implement new TIF projects is removed. Furthermore, the nepotism provision provides a clear and automatic result\u2014forfeiture of office. The penalty provision in § 99.865.7 is not as clear, as it provides only a minimum amount of time during which a municipality is to be precluded from implementing TIF projects; it does not indicate the ultimate duration of any resulting ban. For an answer to that question, judicial intervention is obviously required. \n \nThe second flaw in Dykhouse's argument is that he is seeking quo warranto in response to City's alleged error (noncompliance with statutory reporting requirements) in its exercise of a power lawfully possessed (the power to implement TIF projects). \u201cThe writ of quo warranto is not a substitute for mandamus or injunction nor for an appeal or writ of error.\u201d State ex inf. McKittrick v. Murphy, 148 S.W.2d 527, 530 (Mo. banc 1941). \u201cIt is not to be used to prevent an improper exercise of power lawfully possessed.\u201d Id. Rather, \u201c[i]ts purpose is solely to prevent an officer or corporation or persons purporting to act as such from usurping a power which they do not have.\u201d 9 Id. \n \nWe find this case similar to State ex inf. Nixon v. Kinder, 89 S.W.3d 454 (Mo. banc 2002). In Kinder, the Attorney General filed a petition in quo warranto against two circuit judges, seeking to oust them \u201cfrom continuing to exercise supervisory authority over four receivership funds held in the registry of the Circuit Court \u2024, and to instead pay the money in those funds over to the state treasurer.\u201d Id. at 456. The Attorney General argued that the \u201cjudges no longer ha[d] authority over the remaining funds because sections 447.539 and 447.543, RSMo 2000, \u2024 require[d] the judges to report and pay over any remaining amounts to the state treasurer once the funds had been in existence for five years.\u201d Id. In other words, the Attorney General alleged that the judges, by operation of statute, lost the authority they once possessed over the funds, and, by continuing to exercise authority over the funds, the judges were unlawfully exercising a power they did not have. The Missouri Supreme Court rejected the Attorney General's argument on the ground that \u201c[q]uo warranto is available only where it is alleged that an official has exercised a power he or she does not have, not where, as here, it is alleged that the official exercised an existing power wrongly or for too long of a period.\u201d Id. \n \nHere, it is beyond question that City had the power to consider and implement TIF projects by virtue of the TIF Act. The heart of Dykhouse's petition is that City exercised that power improperly by failing to comply with various reporting requirements laid out in § 99.865. But, as was held in both McKittrick and Kinder, the wrongful exercise of an existing power is simply not an appropriate matter for quo warranto proceedings. \n \nPoint II is granted. The judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded with directions to dismiss. \n \nConclusion \n \nBecause county counselors were not authorized relators at the time Dykhouse filed his petition, he failed to invoke the trial court's jurisdiction over the quo warranto action, and it should have been dismissed. Furthermore, the basis for Dykhouse's petition\u2014City's allegedly improper exercise of its TIF power\u2014does not support a quo warranto proceeding. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of ouster and remand the matter with directions to dismiss the action. \n \nFOOTNOTES \n \n1 .  \u2003All statutory citations are to the Revised Statutes of Missouri 2000, as updated through the 2013 Cumulative Supplement, unless otherwise noted. \n \n2 .  \u2003Though Rule 98.02(b)(2) permits quo warranto proceedings to be brought on behalf of a private party \u201cwith a special interest in the subject matter of the action,\u201d Dykhouse has repeatedly stated that he brought the current action on his own information in his official capacity as the Boone County Counselor and not as a private party. \n \n3 .  \u2003All Rule references are to the Missouri Supreme Court Rules (2014), unless otherwise noted. \n \n4 .  \u2003Though City sought disclosure of this information, Dykhouse argued below that it was protected from discovery by attorney-client privilege. It appears that the trial court accepted this argument, and City has not challenged that ruling on appeal. We are, however, dubious of this claim, as nothing in § 56.640.3 suggests that either party to a mutual cooperation agreement would have the ability to ethically act in a representative capacity for the other in entering the agreement. Though § 56.640.1 provides that \u201cthe county counselor \u2024 shall represent the county and all departments, officers, institutions and agencies thereof, except as otherwise provided by law,\u201d it is also limited to only \u201ccivil suits or actions in which the county or any county officer \u2024 is a party.\u201d Plainly, a mutual cooperation agreement under § 56.640.3 is not a civil suit or action requiring any representation by the county counselor. While § 56.640.1 provides a mechanism for a county counselor to provide opinions, upon request, to any county officer, even if such a request could involve the decision of whether to enter a mutual cooperation agreement with the county counselor himself, such opinions, by express terms of the statute, must be in writing. Such requirements are presumably to avoid coming within the crosshairs of Rule 4-1.11(e)(1), which provides that \u201c[a] lawyer holding public office shall not attempt to influence any agency of any political subdivision of which such lawyer is a public officer, other than as a part of his or her official duties \u2024\u201d \n \n5 .  \u2003Section 531.010 provides:In case any person shall usurp, intrude into or unlawfully hold or execute any office or franchise, the attorney general of the state, or any circuit or prosecuting attorney of the county in which the action is commenced, shall exhibit to the circuit court, or other court having concurrent jurisdiction therewith in civil cases, an information in the nature of a quo warranto, at the relation of any person desiring to prosecute the same; and when such information has been filed and proceedings have been commenced, the same shall not be dismissed or discontinued without the consent of the person named therein as the relator; but such relator shall have the right to prosecute the same to final judgment, either by himself or by attorney; provided if the person named therein is a member or employee of the judicial branch of government, and the persons desiring to prosecute the proceeding include the majority of the circuit and associate circuit judges of the circuit in which that person is employed, the suit may proceed without the approval or participation of the attorney general or any prosecuting attorney, and for all purposes under this chapter, such judges shall be considered the \u201crelator\u201d and may file and prosecute such matter without costs as provided by section 531.050. If such information be filed or exhibited against any person who has usurped, intruded into or is unlawfully holding or executing the office of judge of any judicial circuit, then it shall be the duty of the attorney general of the state, or circuit or prosecuting attorney of the proper county, to exhibit such information to the circuit court of some county adjoining and outside of such judicial circuit, and nearest to the county in which the judge so offending shall reside.The statute was declared unconstitutional, in part, in State ex inf. Nixon v. Kinder, 89 S.W.3d 454, 458 (Mo. banc 2002), insofar as it allowed \u201cone circuit court [to] exercise such authority over another judge of an adjoining circuit.\u201d \n \n6 .  \u2003As in this case, State ex rel. Collector of Winchester v. Jamison, 357 S.W.3d 589, 594 (Mo. banc 2012) addressed the interplay between a statute and a rule. Section 71.675 purported to preclude cities and towns from serving as class representatives in certain suits, while Rule 52.08 governed the requirements and qualifications for filing class actions, generally. Id. at 591-92. The question presented was whether the statute prevailed over the rule. Id. at 591. \n \n7 .  \u2003Additionally, the legislature did not amend § 531.010 to reflect any change in permissible relators in quo warranto actions when it enacted § 56.640.3, thus further evidencing its lack of intent to alter the procedures for filing such actions. \n \n8 .  \u2003Below, City argued that any mutual cooperation agreement executed under § 56.640.3 must be in writing. City has abandoned that argument on appeal, and our own research discloses no direct authority requiring a writing. That being said, however, it would seem that public policy, as articulated in Missouri's Sunshine Law, § 610.010 et seq., would favor such agreements being in writing so as to facilitate government transparency. \n \n9 .  \u2003Though City's alleged noncompliance with the reporting requirements could potentially result in a temporary loss of the power to implement new TIF projects, as noted above, the penalty provision is not self-executing. Thus, there must be a determination by an outside force (either through the court by a declaratory judgment or writ of mandamus or through a finding of noncompliance by the agency responsible for receiving the reports) that City has failed to comply before there can be any removal of the existing power. \n \nKaren King Mitchell, Judge \n \nLisa White Hardwick, Presiding Judge, and Anthony Rex Gabbert, Judge, concur.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"STATE OF MISSOURI CHARLES DYKHOUSE BOONE COUNTY COUNSELOR v.

State of Missouri, Respondent. \n WD78928      Decided: January 24, 2017  Before Division Two: \u2009Lisa White Hardwick, Presiding Judge, and Karen King Mitchell and Anthony Rex Gabbert, Judges \nFollowing a jury trial, Milton George was found to be a sexually violent predator (SVP) under §\u2002632.480, 1 and he was committed to the custody of the Department of Mental Health. George appeals. He argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove clearly and convincingly that his diagnosis of schizophrenia made him more likely than not to commit future predatory acts of sexual violence if not confined to a secure facility and that the State's use at trial of the term \u201csexually violent predator\u201d unconstitutionally prejudiced the jury against him. We affirm. \n \nBackground\u20092 \n \nIn 2009, George was convicted of rape and forcible sodomy and sentenced to eight years in the Department of Corrections. Prior to George's release, the Department provided written notice to the multidisciplinary team under §\u2002632.483.4 that George may meet the criteria of a sexually violent predator. The multidisciplinary team determined that George appeared to meet the definition of a sexually violent predator, and it notified the Attorney General of its assessment. The prosecutors' review committee reviewed the assessment under §\u2002632.483.5 and determined that George met the definition of a sexually violent predator. Prior to George's release, the State filed a petition seeking George's commitment to the Department of Mental Health as a sexually violent predator under the Sexually Violent Predator Act (\u201cSVP Act\u201d), §\u2002632.480, et seq. \n \nAt trial, the State called Dr. Steven Mandracchia, a psychologist, in support of its petition. He was the only witness to testify. Dr. Mandracchia evaluated George to determine if he was an SVP. The doctor testified that he has done approximately forty similar evaluations and that he had reviewed George's records, including criminal records, social history records, treatment records, and records from the Department of Corrections. Based on George's treatment history, including forty to forty-five hospital admissions for schizophrenia over the past 25 years, as well as his behaviors, Dr. Mandracchia opined that George had the mental abnormality of schizophrenia. \n \nDr. Mandracchia testified that George had difficulty controlling his behavior, as demonstrated by his aggression toward others and attempt to harm himself, as well as his bizarre sexual behaviors. The doctor said that, on several occasions, George was brought to psychiatric facilities because of his hypersexual behavior, which included exposing himself in public. \n \nWhile in prison, George had multiple conduct violations for breaking rules, including a physical altercation with a fellow inmate and another with a guard. George had at least three violations that were of a sexual nature. Dr. Mandracchia testified that George urinated in an area of the cell where he should not have been urinating, in full view of an officer. George also masturbated in front of officers on two occasions; \u2009on one of the occasions, George rolled up his mattress and masturbated into it. Dr. Mandracchia said that, when instructed to stop, George refused. While in jail awaiting this trial, George fondled himself in front of other inmates on two occasions. \n \nDuring his incarceration, George was so psychiatrically impaired that he was unable to participate in the sex offender treatment program, although he did complete a clinical review form. On the form, George indicated that he masturbated six times a day; \u2009had fantasies including voyeurism, exposing himself, and fetishes with objects; \u2009looked at pornographic materials; \u2009and had sexual activity with animals. \n \nDr. Mandracchia also relied on an actuarial evaluation, which determined that George was \u201cin the moderate to moderately high range\u201d to reoffend if not in a secure facility. Dr. Mandracchia testified that the actuarial test underestimated George's likelihood to commit sexually violent crimes if not in a secure facility, because it measured the likelihood only of a person being rearrested or reconvicted. \n \nBased on this information, Dr. Mandracchia found that George was an SVP. Dr. Mandracchia opined that George's schizophrenia caused him to have serious difficulty controlling his behavior and made him more likely than not to commit another predatory act of sexual violence if not placed in a controlled facility. \n \nThe jury found that George was an SVP. On May 12, 2015, the probate court issued its Judgment and Commitment Order finding that George was an SVP and committing him to the custody of the Department of Mental Health for control, care, and treatment until such time as George's mental abnormality had so changed that he was safe to be at large. \n \nStandard of Review \n \n\u201cAppellate review in an SVP case is limited to a determination of whether there was sufficient evidence admitted from which a reasonable jury could have found each necessary element by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d In re A.B., 334 S.W.3d 746, 752 (Mo. App. E.D. 2011). \u201cThe appellate court does not reweigh the evidence but determines only whether the judgment was supported by sufficient evidence.\u201d Id. \u201cMatters of credibility and weight of testimony are for the jury to determine.\u201d Id. \u201cFor that reason, the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment, accepting as true all evidence and reasonable inferences favorable to the judgment and disregarding all contrary evidence and inferences.\u201d Id. \u201cA judgment will be reversed on insufficiency of the evidence only if there is a complete absence of probative facts supporting the judgment.\u201d Id. \n \nQuestions of law are reviewed de novo. In re Murphy, 477 S.W.3d 77, 81 (Mo. App. E.D. 2015). \n \nAnalysis \n \n\u201cMissouri's SVP statute requires a finding that, to be committed, the individual 1) has a history of past sexually violent behavior; \u20092) a mental abnormality; \u2009and 3) the abnormality creates a danger to others if the person is not incapacitated.\u201d In re Murrell, 215 S.W.3d 96, 105 (Mo. banc 2007). Under §\u2002632.480(5)(a), an offender has a history of sexually violent behavior if he \u201c[h]as pled guilty or been found guilty \u2024 of a sexually violent offense.\u201d George does not dispute that rape and forcible sodomy are sexually violent offenses. Once a history of sexual violence has been established, before an offender may be committed as an SVP, \u201cthe State must satisfy a two-prong test: \u2009(1) the offender must suffer from a mental abnormality; \u2009(2) that makes him more likely than not to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility.\u201d A.B., 334 S.W.3d at 752. \n \nGeorge offers five points on appeal. In his first three points, George argues that there was insufficient evidence to find him to be an SVP because the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that it was more likely than not that he would engage in predatory acts of sexual violence in that: \u2009(1) there was no evidence that George's mental abnormality, schizophrenia, predisposes him to commit predatory acts of sexual violence; \u2009(2) the State's expert testimony was without foundation because Dr. Mandracchia failed to specify that the threat of future sexual violence must be predatory and failed to define the term; \u2009and (3) there was no evidence that any future sexual violence George might commit would be for the primary purpose of victimization, a requirement for the behavior to be predatory. In George's fourth and fifth points, he argues that he was deprived of a fair trial because the State was allowed to use the \u201cinherently pejorative\u201d phrase \u201csexually violent predator\u201d at trial, and the phrase appeared in the instructions. \n \nI.\u2003Predisposition to acts of predatory violence. \n \nIn his first point, George claims that the State failed to prove that his mental abnormality, schizophrenia, predisposes him to commit sexual violence. In support, George argues that, while Dr. Mandracchia did testify that George suffers from schizophrenia, Dr. Mandracchia never explicitly testified that schizophrenia predisposed George to commit predatory acts of sexual violence. In fact, according to George, \u201cDr. Mandracchia's testimony established the opposite\u201d because he \u201ctestified to his own opinion that \u2018it does not predispose people to commit sex crimes, when you say just the diagnosis of schizophrenia.\u2019\u2009\u201d \n \nBut George simply misunderstands that the SVP statute does not require proof of \u201ca mental abnormality that, in and of itself, predisposes a person to commit sexually violent offenses.\u201d Murrell, 215 S.W.3d at 106. Rather, \u201cMissouri's SVP statute \u2024 only require[s] \u2018evidence of past sexually violent behavior and a present mental condition that creates a likelihood of such conduct in the future if the person is not incapacitated.\u2019\u2009\u201d Id. (quoting Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 357\u201358 (1997)). \u201cUnder [§]\u2002632.480 \u2024, \u2018mental abnormality\u2019 is (1) a congenital or acquired condition; \u2009(2) affecting the emotional or volitional capacity; \u2009(3) that predisposes the person to commit sexually violent offenses; \u2009(4) in a degree that causes the individual serious difficulty controlling his behavior.\u201d Id. George claims that Dr. Mandracchia's testimony did not establish the third element. \n \nDr. Mandracchia testified that George suffers from the \u201cmental abnormality of schizophrenia,\u201d which affects George's volitional capacity, resulting in \u201crepeated instances of inappropriate poorly controlled or apparently uncontrolled sexual behaviors,\u201d and which \u201c[w]ould render him having serious difficulty controlling his behavior and being more likely than not to reoffend if not in a controlled environment.\u201d Dr. Mandracchia went on to testify that, by \u201creoffend,\u201d he meant \u201ccommitting a predatory act of sexual violence.\u201d Thus, while Dr. Mandracchia's testimony was clear that schizophrenia does not necessarily predispose all individuals to commit predatory acts of sexual violence, it did affect George in that manner in that it rendered him unable to control his sexual behavior. Dr. Mandracchia's opinion was based on a review of documents in the record, which were of the type normally relied on by psychologists when making a determination of whether someone is in fact an SVP. This evidence was sufficient for the jury to determine that George has a mental abnormality that predisposes him to commit sexually violent offenses. \n \nGeorge's first point is denied. \n \nII.\u2003Failure to define \u201cpredatory.\u201d \n \nIn his second point, George argues that the State failed to provide the jury with \u201cthe correct legal standard\u201d to prove that he had a mental abnormality. George again claims that Dr. Mandracchia never specifically testified that George was likely to commit \u201cpredatory acts\u201d of sexual violence, as required by §\u2002632.480(5). George further argues that Dr. Mandracchia failed to define \u201cpredatory\u201d in his testimony. George argues that, because of these alleged shortcomings, Dr. Mandracchia's testimony \u201clacked foundation.\u201d 3 We disagree. \n \nAs noted infra, Dr. Mandracchia testified that George suffers from a mental abnormality, which \u201c[w]ould render him having serious difficulty controlling his behavior and being more likely than not to reoffend if not in a controlled environment.\u201d Dr. Mandracchia then clarified that \u201creoffend\u201d meant \u201ccommitting a predatory act of sexual violence.\u201d Dr. Mandracchia plainly did testify that George was likely to commit predatory acts of sexual violence, and thus, George's first argument is without merit. \n \nGeorge next notes that the SVP Act defines \u201c[p]redatory\u201d as \u201cacts directed towards individuals, including family members, for the primary purpose of victimization.\u201d §\u2002632.480(3). George claims that Dr. Mandracchia never set forth this precise definition in his testimony, leaving the jury to speculate as to whether Dr. Mandracchia's definition was consistent with the statutory definition with which the jury was instructed. This argument is meritless because the record shows that the jury was not misled or left to speculate as to the meaning of the term in Dr. Mandracchia's testimony. \n \nIn support of his claim that Dr. Mandracchia was required to specifically define \u201cpredatory,\u201d George points to Lee v. Hartwig, 848 S.W.2d 496, 498\u201399 (Mo. App. W.D. 1992), and McLaughlin v. Griffith, 220 S.W.3d 319, 321 (Mo. App. S.D. 2007), negligence cases in which experts failed to define the proper legal standard\u2014\u201cnegligence\u201d and \u201cstandard of care\u201d respectively\u2014and their testimony was therefore found to be insufficient. \n \nOf course \u201c[l]egal or technical words occurring in the instructions should be defined.\u201d In re Van Orden, 271 S.W.3d 579, 586 (Mo. banc 2008). For example, \u201cunder MAI, \u2024 many definitions are required.\u201d Huff v. Union Elec. Co., 598 S.W.2d 503, 509, 509 n.5 (Mo. App. E.D. 1980) (citing to MAI definitions relating to negligence (MAI 11.00), uninsured motor vehicles (MAI 12.00), agency (MAI 13.00), right-of-way (MAI 14.00) and will contests (MAI 15.00)). \u201cAn expert who testifies,\u201d for example, \u201csolely in terms of \u2018standards of care,\u2019 without reference to MAI 11.06 or comparable language, does not satisfactorily articulate the appropriate legal standard.\u201d McLaughlin, 220 S.W.3d at 321; \u2009Lee, 848 S.W.2d at 499 (\u201cIt was not an abuse of discretion to sustain the objection [to the expert's testimony as to negligence], in view of the failure of either party to define the term \u2018negligence.\u2019\u2009\u201d). \n \nBut \u201cpredatory\u201d is not a term defined in the MAI. And George offers no authority in support of his contention that, solely because a term is defined in a statute, that word constitutes a \u201clegal or technical term,\u201d requiring testimony as to its definition. The State argues that \u201c[t]he word \u2018predatory\u2019 does not need to be defined as it is commonly used and readily understandable.\u201d \u201c[T]he meaning of ordinary words used in their usual or conventional sense need not be defined.\u201d Van Orden, 271 S.W.3d at 586. \n \nGeorge correctly points out that the legislative definition of words controls, but he makes no attempt to explain how the statutory definition of \u201cpredatory\u201d differs from the common meaning. In common usage, \u201cthe terms \u2018predator\u2019 or \u2018predatory\u2019 refer to either \u2018one that preys, destroys, or devours' or one \u2018disposed or showing disposition to injure or exploit others for one's own gain.\u2019\u2009\u201d State v. Perry, 275 S.W.3d 237, 247 n.6 (Mo. banc 2009) (quoting Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary, 1785 (3d ed. 1993)). \u201cWhen read with the grammatical modifier \u2018sexual,\u2019 the term refers to a person that either sexually preys on or is disposed or shows a disposition to sexually exploit others.\u201d Id. Section 632.480(3) defines \u201c[p]redatory,\u201d as \u201cacts directed towards individuals, including family members, for the primary purpose of victimization.\u201d We fail to see a meaningful distinction between the common definition of \u201cpredator\u201d and its statutory definition in this context. \n \nEven when a term does require definition, it \u201cneed not be recited in ritualistic fashion.\u201d McLaughlin, 220 S.W.3d at 321. Rather, \u201cthe expert's testimony in context should prove that the proper legal standard was used.\u201d Id. \u201c[J]urors must know an expert's opinion is based on [the law] and not something else.\u201d Id. \n \nDr. Mandracchia testified that \u201cthe definitions [that] we work with \u2024 are all from statutes.\u201d Dr. Mandracchia further testified that: \n \nThe statute itself basically just says that anybody who has\u2014the words are \u201ca congenital or acquired condition\u201d\u2014what that means is you are born with it or you get it later, \u2024 that predisposes a person to commit acts of sexual violence such that it causes them to have difficulty controlling their behavior. So that's leg one, having a mental abnormality that predisposes you to this. And leg two, that mental abnormality would have to make it more likely than not to reoffend if you're not confined. \n \nAnd Dr. Mandraccchia clarified that \u201creoffend\u201d meant \u201ccommitting a predatory act of sexual violence.\u201d \n \nIn context, Dr. Mandracchia's testimony makes it clear that his opinions are based on the definitions contained in §\u2002632.480. Certainly, George was allowed to cross-examine Dr. Mandracchia as to his application of the statutory definitions. But for purposes of determining the foundation of Dr. Mandracchia's testimony as it relates to the submissibility of the State's case, Dr. Mandracchia's testimony showed that \u201cthe proper legal standard was used,\u201d and was \u201cbased on [the law] and not something else.\u201d McLaughlin, 220 S.W.3d at 321. \n \nGeorge's second point is denied. \n \nIII.\u2003Evidence supported finding that George's likely future sexual violence would be predatory. \n \nIn his third point, George argues that the State offered insufficient evidence to prove that he is more likely than not to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence. Stated another way, George argues that there was no evidence that any sexually violent acts he might commit in the future will be predatory in nature. We disagree. \n \nGeorge correctly notes that the State must prove that George \u201csuffers from a mental abnormality which makes [him] more likely than not to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility.\u201d §\u2002632.480(5). And the State was required to prove \u201cthat [George] was not only more likely than not to sexually reoffend, but to so offend in a predatory and violent manner, as required by the definition of an SVP in §\u2002632.480(5).\u201d In re Cokes, 107 S.W.3d 317, 323\u201324 (Mo. App. W.D. 2003). Relying heavily on Cokes, and In re Morgan, 176 S.W.3d 200, 202 (Mo. App. W.D. 2005), George argues that the State's evidence was insufficient to prove that any future sexual conduct would be predatory in nature. We reject George's argument because his analysis of both cases is misleading. \n \nGeorge first relies on Cokes, a case very similar to this one, in which \u201cDr. Mandracchia testified that, in evaluating the appellant, he reviewed psychiatric, police, and prison records; \u2009interviewed the appellant; \u2009and administered two actuarial instruments.\u201d Cokes, 107 S.W.3d at 322. In addressing whether Cokes was an SVP, Dr. Mandracchia's testimony was as follows: \n \nQ. Did you try to make a determination as a result of this mental abnormality and looking at your actuarial measures, did you try to determine whether or not it was more likely than not Mr. Cokes would sexually reoffend? \n \nA. Yes, I did. \n \nQ. What is your determination? \n \nA. I determined that in terms of probability it is more likely than not that he will reoffend. \n \nId. The appellant argued that this testimony was insufficient to support a determination that he was likely to \u201creoffend in a predatory and violent way.\u201d Id. at 323. This court agreed, noting that Dr. Mandracchia \u201cnever render[ed] an opinion to that effect.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the court found that \u201cthe record reflects that Dr. Mandracchia's testimony lacked any detail that would have imparted to the jury the necessary knowledge to allow it to reasonably infer \u2024 that the appellant would not only sexually reoffend, but would do so in a violent and predatory manner.\u201d Id. at 323\u201324. \n \nAccording to George, the State's case is similarly deficient here. But Cokes also determined that, despite the State's failure to prove its case, remand, as opposed to a reversal, was warranted, because the record showed that the State could make a submissible case. Id. at 325. This court held that, on remand, the State \u201ccould \u2024 present[\u2009] sufficient evidence to allow the jury to reasonably infer that the appellant was more likely than not to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence [by] simply ask[ing] Dr. Mandracchia whether, in his expert opinion, the appellant's likelihood of sexually reoffending would occur in a violent and predatory manner.\u201d Id. \n \nHere, Dr. Mandracchia, relying on George's records and actuarial tools, testified that George had a mental abnormality that \u201c[w]ould render him having serious difficulty controlling his behavior and being more likely than not to reoffend if not in a controlled environment.\u201d And \u201cby reoffend,\u201d Dr. Mandracchia testified that he \u201cmean[t] committing a predatory act of sexual violence.\u201d This is precisely the testimony and evidence that, in Cokes, this court said would be sufficient to make a submissible case that an offender is an SVP. \n \nGeorge implies that this aspect of the holding in Cokes was overruled \u201ctwo years later in Morgan,\u201d where the State's expert did testify that the appellant was \u201cmore likely than not to commit future predatory acts of sexual violence,\u201d but the testimony was still held to be insufficient. Morgan, 176 S.W.3d at 210\u201311. But George again misstates the holding. \n \nIn Morgan, the State's expert relied \u201con the evidence of the appellant's past acts of sexual violence, and \u2024 the results from several \u2018risk assessments' [the expert] conducted.\u201d Id. at 211. Based on these factors, the expert opined that \u201cthe appellant was more likely than not to engage in future predatory acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility.\u201d Id. at 203. The court determined that, under the present statutory definition, \u201cthe State's evidence would have been sufficient to demonstrate that the appellant's prior acts of sexual violence were predatory in nature such that the State would have made a submissible case on the issue of whether he was more likely than not to engage in future acts of sexual violence.\u201d Id. at 207. However, the State had \u201cstipulated and agreed to the use of the prior \u2024 definition of \u2018predatory act\u2019 to be used in the verdict director.\u201d Id. And under \u201cthe prior definition of \u2018predatory acts' found in §\u2002632.480(3) [RSMo 1999], the State was required to prove \u2024 that he was more likely than not to engage in \u2018acts directed towards strangers or individuals with whom relationships have been established or promoted for the primary purpose of victimization.\u2019\u2009\u201d Id. at 208. Accordingly, \u201cit was not enough that the act was for the primary purpose of victimization.\u201d Id. at 206. \u201cThere had to be evidence that a relationship had been established or promoted with the victim for the primary purpose of victimization.\u201d Id. at 207. In Morgan, \u201cthe State did not produce any evidence from which it could be reasonably inferred by the jury that, after the initial relationships were established with the victims, the appellant targeted them for victimization by intentionally cultivating close, trusting relationships with them,\u201d and therefore failed to meet its burden to prove that the appellant was more likely than not to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence under the applicable definition. Id. \n \nAgain, under the current statute, the State is required to prove that George is \u201cmore likely than not to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence,\u201d §\u2002632.480(5), which is defined as \u201cacts directed towards individuals, including family members, for the primary purpose of victimization.\u201d §\u2002632.480(3). The higher standard that the State stipulated to in Morgan is inapplicable. In Morgan, \u201c[t]he critical issue \u2024 [was] not whether the appellant was likely to re-offend in a sexually violent manner.\u201d Morgan, 176 S.W.3d at 211. Rather, \u201cwhether the State made a submissible case ultimately turned on which version of the definition of \u2018predatory act\u2019 was used.\u201d Id. at 207. There was no question that the State's expert's reliance on \u201cthe appellant's prior acts of sexual violence and the assessment results,\u201d id. at 211\u2014much less than Dr. Mandracchia relied on here\u2014was \u201csufficient to demonstrate that the appellant's prior acts of sexual violence were predatory in nature.\u201d Id. at 207. \n \nGeorge's third point is denied. \n \nIV.\u2003Use of the phrase \u201csexually violent predator\u201d is not prejudicial. \n \nFinally, in George's fourth and fifth points, he challenges the use of the phrase \u201csexually violent predator\u201d by the State during trial and in the jury instructions. In his fourth point, George complains of the State's use of the phrase throughout trial, and in his fifth point, he argues that it should not have been used to instruct the jury. \n \nGeorge relies heavily on Perry, a trial for first-degree child molestation, in which the defendant challenged two comments made by the prosecution, arguing that they were inherently prejudicial. Perry, 275 S.W.3d at 245\u201346. The first challenged statement was, \u201cThis was a touch done by a child molester.\u201d Id. at 246. Certainly, \u201cchild molester\u201d is an exceedingly pejorative term. But the Supreme Court brushed aside the argument that the defendant was prejudiced by the language because the defendant \u201cwas charged with child molestation, and the whole premise of the prosecution was that [the] touch was done by a child molester and for the purpose of sexual gratification.\u201d Id. \u201cThere was no error \u2024 in making this argument[, because t]he prosecutor is allowed to make arguments based on facts in evidence.\u201d Id. \n \nThe second comment that the defendant in Perry challenged as inherently prejudicial was \u201cthe prosecutor's use of the term \u2018sexual predator\u2019\u2009\u201d to describe the defendant. Id. This comment the Court found to be \u201ctroublesome,\u201d in part because the term is \u201cinherently pejorative.\u201d Id. at 246, 247. But the Court clarified that it was not the pejorative nature of the term, itself, that made the statement objectionable. Rather, the statement was objectionable because the defendant \u201chad not been found to be a sexual predator nor would the offense for which he was on trial qualify him automatically as one were he convicted.\u201d Id. at 246\u201347. The statement therefore \u201ccalled for the jury to speculate as to what [the defendant] might become in the future in deciding his guilt, rather than deciding his guilt of the crime for which he was charged.\u201d Id. at 247. \n \nHere, there were two instances during closing argument in which the State arguably called George an SVP. First, the State stated that \u201cwe are asking you today to make the finding that Mr. George is indeed a sexually[\u2009]violent predator under Missouri law \u2024 because he is a sexually[\u2009]violent predator \u2024 [under] the definition you have learned about today.\u201d Second, the State argued that, \u201c[u]nder the law, [George] meets the definition of a sexually[\u2009]violent predator.\u201d And of course Dr. Mandracchia testified generally that George meets the definition of a sexually violent predator. \n \nThese uses of the phrase are plainly allowable under Perry. Each use of the phrase \u201csexually violent predator\u201d by the State was in \u201carguments based on facts in evidence,\u201d which the State is allowed to make. Id. at 246. Moreover, there is no concern that the jury would have to \u201cspeculate as to what [George] might become in the future in deciding his guilt, rather than deciding his guilt of the crime for which he was charged.\u201d Id. at 247. The specific issue in this trial was whether George, based on his past conduct and current mental abnormality, was \u201cmore likely than not to engage in [future] predatory acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility.\u201d A.B., 334 S.W.3d at 752. \n \nGeorge's reliance on State v. Whitfield, 837 S.W.2d 503 (Mo. banc 1992), is similarly misplaced. In Whitfield, \u201cthe prosecutor referred to defendant as a \u2018mass murderer\u2019 four times and as a \u2018serial killer\u2019 three times\u201d during closing argument. Id. at 513. The Court noted that \u201c[t]he terms \u2018mass murderer\u2019 and \u2018serial killer\u2019 are pejorative names associated with a small ghoulish class of homicidal sociopaths who repeatedly and cruelly murder for no apparent motive than to satisfy a perverse desire to kill or cause pain.\u201d Id. The Court then determined that \u201c[n]o evidence suggests that the defendant's prior homicides were of this character,\u201d and concluded that \u201c[t]he use of these words is name calling designed to inflame passions of jurors.\u201d Id. \u201cComments designed solely to inflame jurors against the defendant by associating him with heinous crimes not in the record is always error, although not always reversible error.\u201d Id. \n \nHere, the State did associate George with heinous crimes\u2014rape and forcible sodomy. But George does not deny that he committed those crimes, and presenting evidence of those crimes was necessary to the State carrying its burden. And the State's use of the phrase \u201csexually violent predator\u201d was in the context of arguing to the jury that the evidence proved that George is an SVP. George does not dispute the sufficiency of this evidence, other than the points that we have already rejected. Accordingly, the State's reference to George being an SVP were not \u201cdesigned solely to inflame jurors against the defendant by associating him with heinous crimes not in the record.\u201d Id. Rather, they were assertions wholly based on the evidence, which the State was required to prove under §\u2002632.480. George has provided no authority holding that this type of argument based on the evidence is objectionable, even if the term used would normally be considered pejorative, and we are aware of none. \n \nGeorge's argument that the phrase \u201csexually violent predator\u201d is so inherently prejudicial as to automatically deprive one of a fair trial has also been unanimously rejected by courts that have considered the issue. Our Supreme Court has held, at least under plain error review, that the phrase \u201csexual predator\u201d does not necessarily \u201cdecisively affect[\u2009] the jury's determination sufficiently to deny \u2024 a fair trial.\u201d Perry, 275 S.W.3d at 248. Other states have held that, in cases brought to determine whether an offender should be confined as an SVP, \u201c[t]he term \u2018sexually violent predator\u2019 needed to be defined to the jury and the prosecution had to prove \u2024 that [the offender] fit that definition.\u201d People v. Field, 204 Cal. Rptr. 3d 548, 559 (Cal. Ct. App. 2016). Accordingly, \u201c[t]here was nothing improper about the use of the term \u2018sexual violent predator\u2019 during the trial.\u201d Id. See also Malone v. State, 405 S.W.3d 917, 926\u201327 (Tex. Ct. App. 2013) (holding that use of the phrase \u201csexually violent predator\u201d in an SVP case does not violate the right to a fair trial). 4 \n \nIn George's fifth point, he argues that \u201cthe emotionally charged phrase (\u2018sexually violent predator\u2019),\u201d which was used in Instructions 5, 6, 7, and the verdict form, \u201cinflamed the jury, was argumentative, and favored the State's position.\u201d Having determined that the use of the phrase \u201csexually violent predator\u201d is not prejudicial when used in a trial to determine whether an individual is an SVP, there is little reason to believe that the phrase would be prejudicial when instructing the jury. But the State argues that we need not review this argument at all because Instruction 5, which includes the phrase \u201csexually violent predator,\u201d was submitted by George himself, and provided to the jury over the State's objection. We agree. \n \nIt is axiomatic that \u201c[a]ppellate courts will not reverse a trial court on the basis of an invited error.\u201d Floyd v. Dep't of Mental Health, 452 S.W.3d 154, 156 n.2 (Mo. App. W.D. 2014) (quoting Roberts v. Roberts, 432 S.W.3d 789, 796 (Mo. App. W.D. 2014)). And a party invites error when it offers an instruction and then complains about the language contained in that instruction. State v. Oudin, 403 S.W.3d 693, 697\u201398 (Mo. App. W.D. 2013); \u2009see also In re Scates, 134 S.W.3d 738, 742 (Mo. App. S.D. 2004) (rejecting as \u201cdisingenuous\u201d appellant's argument related to language of an instruction when appellant's instruction contained identical language). \n \nGeorge responds that he offered Instruction 5 only \u201cafter the trial court denied his motion and objections to use of the term in the instructions.\u201d While George offers no additional argument or authority, we presume that he is referring to cases \u201cdistinguish[ing] between the party who invites error and the party who yields to it on demand of the court.\u201d Myers v. Buchanan, 333 S.W.2d 18, 24 (Mo. banc 1960). But as George himself notes, \u201c[t]he clear purpose in offering Instruction 5 was to include the definition of \u2018clear and convincing evidence,\u2019\u2009\u201d and \u201cit is not necessary to denominate a label in \u2024 Instruction 5 \u2024 while simply, briefly and impartially instructing the jury without argument.\u201d We agree. George could easily have crafted an instruction defining the concept of clear and convincing evidence without the use of the term \u201csexually violent predator.\u201d But having used the phrase in his own proposed instruction, he cannot now claim that it was error for the phrase to be included in the jury instructions. Oudin, 403 S.W.3d at 698 n.10 (\u201cwhere a defendant submits a faulty instruction, the defendant waives appellate review as to the specific defect presented in the proffered instruction, regardless of whether the court ultimately uses the proffered instruction or the State's version containing the same defect\u201d). \n \nGeorge's fourth and fifth points are denied. \n \nConclusion \n \nHaving found no error, the judgment of the probate court is affirmed. \n \nFOOTNOTES \n \n1 .  \u2003Unless otherwise stated, statutory references are to the Revised Statutes of Missouri 2000, as updated through the 2014 Cumulative Supplement. \n \n2 .  \u2003We \u201creview[\u2009] the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.\u201d In re Murrell, 215 S.W.3d 96, 100 n.3 (Mo. banc 2007). \n \n3 .  \u2003\u201cIf a question exists as to whether proffered expert testimony is supported by a sufficient factual or scientific foundation, the question is one of admissibility, which must be raised by a timely objection or motion to strike.\u201d In re Bradshaw, 375 S.W.3d 237, 243 (Mo. App. S.D. 2012) (quoting In re Muston, 350 S.W.3d 493, 497 (Mo. App. S.D. 2011)). \u201cOnce an expert opinion has been admitted, as any other evidence, it may be relied upon for purposes of determining the submissibility of the case.\u201d Id. (quoting Muston, 350 S.W.3d at 497). \u201cAn appellant cannot \u2018back-door\u2019 an issue relating to the admissibility of expert testimony under the guise of a sufficiency of the evidence argument.\u201d Id. (quoting Muston, 350 S.W.3d at 497). \n \n4 .  \u2003George argues for the first time in his reply brief that \u201c[a] recent study confirmed the prejudice and bias inherent in the term's use in legal proceedings.\u201d Even if George had not waived the claim by raising it for the first time in a reply brief, Caranchini v. Missouri Bd. of Law Examiners, 447 S.W.3d 768, 772 (Mo. App. W.D. 2014), we are unable to review the purported study because George failed to provide it to the court in any accessible format. But even if we accept George's recitation of the findings of the study\u2014that jurors are more likely to believe that a convicted felon should be placed on parole if they are told that the offender is a \u201cfelon\u201d than if they are told the offender is an SVP\u2014the study does not support George's position. The jurors here were not told that George has ever been found to be an SVP. Rather, they were provided evidence about his felonies and mental abnormality, and asked to determine whether he is an SVP. \n \nKaren King Mitchell, Judge \n \nLisa White Hardwick, Presiding Judge, and Anthony Rex Gabbert, Judge, concur.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of Milton George a/k/a Milton D.

BURGETT, Appellant, v. TASHA R. THOMAS, Respondent. \n WD 79431      Decided: January 17, 2017  Before Division IV: Mark D. Pfeiffer, Chief Judge, and Thomas H. Newton and Gary D. Witt, Judges \nMr. Charles L. Burgett (\u201cFather\u201d) appeals, pro se, a judgment by the Jackson County Circuit Court (\u201ctrial court\u201d) dismissing the paternity and child custody lawsuit he brought against the mother, Ms. Tasha R. Thomas (\u201cMother\u201d), of his purported natural child, Princess Ashe-Rena Thomas (\u201cChild\u201d). We affirm. \n \nFactual and Procedural Background \n \nIn 2002, Father and Mother engaged in a sexual relationship that ultimately resulted in the birth of Child on June 16, 2003. Child has primarily resided with Mother for most or all of her life, residing in Johnson County, Kansas, for two years prior to the filing of Father's lawsuit in the State of Missouri. Child attended public school in Johnson County, Kansas. Father appears to have had some amount of contact with Child given that the Johnson County, Kansas, Department for Children and Family Services (\u201cKansas DCF\u201d) was notified of possible physical and/or emotional abuse involving both Father and Mother in 2013. \n \nAs is relevant to the instant case, by order of the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas (\u201cKansas District Court\u201d), Kansas DCF took Child into temporary protective custody on February 13, 2015, and the Kansas District Court later entered subsequent orders relating to Child in July 2015. \n \nIn June 2015, while the Kansas District Court custody proceeding was still pending, Father filed the instant lawsuit against Mother in Missouri, alleging that Mother and Child live in Missouri and not Kansas. In addition to seeking a determination of paternity as to Child, Father also sought primary custody of Child, an official surname change for Child, and child support from Mother. A trial judge was assigned to the case on June 26, 2015. \n \nMother was never successfully served with process in the instant case; instead, the process server assigned to the case reported that the Missouri address Father provided in his pleading was a \u201cbad address\u201d for Mother. Nonetheless, Mother voluntarily entered her appearance at a case management conference held on November 19, 2015. \n \nThe trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on December 1, 2015, to determine the issue of which state\u2014Missouri or Kansas\u2014had priority jurisdiction\u2009 1 to adjudicate Father's paternity suit pursuant to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (\u201cUCCJEA\u201d). 2 \n \nThe trial court ultimately determined that it did not have the statutory authority to proceed with Father's case because Missouri was not Child's home state, nor had it been Child's home state within six months prior to the commencement of Father's suit, and a custody proceeding involving the Child had been commenced in Kansas that was still pending at the time Father filed the instant suit. Accordingly, the trial court dismissed Father's paternity suit without prejudice by Judgment dated December 1, 2015. 3 \n \nAfter the trial court's dispositive ruling on Father's petition, Father filed an application for change of judge on December 18, 2015. Father also filed a Rule 78.01 motion seeking a new trial on December 29, 2015. The trial court denied both the application for change of judge and the motion seeking a new trial. \n \nFather appeals. \n \nI. Trial Court's UCCJEA Ruling \n \nIn Point I, Father appeals from the denial of his post-judgment motion seeking a new trial. We note from the outset that \u201c[n]o appeal lies from an order overruling a motion for a new trial, but the aggrieved party may appeal from a final judgment entered against [it].\u201d Basta v. Kansas City Power & Light Co., 456 S.W.3d 447, 451 (Mo. App. W.D. 2014) (internal quotation omitted). That said, the gist of Father's argument in Point I is that the trial court erred in refusing to exercise jurisdiction under the UCCJEA. We therefore assume that Father's appeal is from the trial court's judgment dismissing his suit without prejudice, and we exercise our discretion to review the same to determine whether the trial court erred in concluding that it did not have the statutory authority to exercise jurisdiction over Father's case. \n \nStandard of Review \n \n\u201cWhether Missouri has jurisdiction to determine custody under the UCCJEA is \u2024 a legal question this Court reviews de novo. The circuit court's judgment will be affirmed unless there is no substantial evidence to support it, it is against the weight of the evidence, or it erroneously declares or applies the law.\u201d Blanchette v. Blanchette, 476 S.W.3d 273, 277-78 (Mo. banc 2015) (internal citations omitted). We view any conflicting evidence in the light most favorable to the circuit court's judgment and defer to its credibility assessments. Id. at 278 n.1. \u201cWhen the evidence supports two reasonable but different inferences, [we are] obligated to defer to the circuit court's assessment of the evidence.\u201d Id. \n \nAnalysis \n \nUnder Missouri law, the UCCJEA provides \u201cthe exclusive jurisdictional basis for making a child custody determination by a court of this state.\u201d § 452.740.2. See also Ketteman v. Ketteman, 347 S.W.3d 647, 653 (Mo. App. W.D. 2011) (\u201c[T]he provisions of the [UCCJEA] must be met for Missouri courts to have subject matter jurisdiction over a child custody proceeding.\u201d). On this jurisdictional topic, section 452.740.1(1) mandates that Missouri must either be the child's home state\u2009 4 on the date of the commencement of the proceeding, or Missouri must have been the child's home state within six months prior to the commencement of the proceeding and the child is currently absent from the state but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in Missouri. § 452.740.1(1). Further, the UCCJEA provides that Missouri courts shall not exercise jurisdiction \u201cif, at the time of the commencement of the proceeding, a proceeding concerning the custody of the child had been previously commenced in a court of another state having jurisdiction\u201d in conformity with the UCCJEA, \u201cunless the proceeding has been terminated.\u201d § 452.765.1. \n \nMissouri courts, therefore, \u201cshould make an initial determination of their statutory authority to proceed under the [UCCJEA] by express findings before proceeding to the substantive issue of custody.\u201d Ketteman, 347 S.W.3d at 655. \n \nIn the instant case, the trial court determined, in part, that it did not have the statutory authority to proceed with Father's case because the credible evidence demonstrated that Child had resided in Kansas with Mother for two years prior to the filing of Father's Missouri lawsuit. Hence, Missouri was neither Child's present home state, nor had Missouri been Child's home state within six months prior to the commencement of Father's suit. On this basis alone, we conclude that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the trial court's \u201chome state\u201d conclusion regarding Child and we must affirm the trial court's judgment. \n \nHere, there was conflicting evidence about Child's (and Mother's) residence. First, Mother claimed that she lived in Johnson County, Kansas, and had lived there for a period of two years prior to the filing of Father's paternity and custody petition. In contrast, Father claimed that Mother lived with Child in Missouri. However, the trial court noted in its judgment that the Missouri address Father provided to the process server for service upon Mother was ineffective, with the process server reporting it to be a \u201cbad address\u201d and returning the summons non-est. Second, there was evidence in the record that Child attended school in Kansas rather than Missouri, which necessarily implies that Child had some official residence in the State of Kansas for the purposes of school mailings and enrollment. 5 Finally, a Kansas District Court proceeding involving the custody of Child was pending at the time of Father's lawsuit filed in the present case. In its judgment, the trial court concluded that the credible evidence was that Mother and Child had resided in the State of Kansas for two years preceding the filing of Father's lawsuit in Missouri. \n \nAs stated above, we view any conflicting evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's judgment; we defer to the trial court's credibility assessments; and \u201c[w]hen the evidence supports two reasonable but different inferences, [we are] obligated to defer to the circuit court's assessment of the evidence.\u201d Blanchette v. Blanchette, 476 S.W.3d 273, 278 n.1 (Mo. banc 2015). In light of this standard, we defer to the trial court's conclusion that the credible evidence was that Mother and Child resided in the State of Kansas and had resided in the State of Kansas for two years prior to the commencement of Father's lawsuit in Missouri. This conclusion provided substantial evidence supporting the trial court's judgment concluding that Missouri was not Child's home state on the date of the commencement of Father's lawsuit, nor had the State of Missouri been Child's home state at any time within the six months prior to the commencement of Father's lawsuit. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court's judgment declining to exercise priority jurisdiction under the UCCJEA. \n \nPoint I is denied. \n \nII. Father's Application for Change of Judge \n \nIn Point II, Father argues that after the dispositive issue in the underlying case had been submitted to the trial court and after the trial court had issued a dispositive judgment on December 1, 2015, it was error for the trial court to deny an application for change of judge that he claims was timely filed under Rule 51.05. 6 We disagree. \n \nStandard of Review \n \nA denial of a motion for change of judge is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is committed if the trial court's decision defies logic under the circumstances, is sufficiently arbitrary and unreasonable to shock the conscience of the court, and exhibits a dearth of careful consideration. \n \nCity of Kansas City v. Powell, 451 S.W.3d 724, 742-43 (Mo. App. W.D. 2014) (internal citations and quotations omitted). \n \nAnalysis \n \nUnder Missouri law, \u201c[i]t has long been settled \u2024 that the right to disqualify a judge is not to be employed to produce inconvenience and absurdity.\u201d Jenkins v. Andrews, 526 S.W.2d 369, 372 (Mo. App. 1975) (internal quotation omitted). In Jenkins, the \u201cabsurdity\u201d referenced by the court was an attempt by the appellants to seek a change of judge after dispositive proceedings had already been submitted to the trial court. Id. at 373. Ultimately, the Jenkins court found no error in the denial of the request for change of judge after a dispositive proceeding had been submitted to the trial court. Id. \n \nSimilarly, in Heller v. Aldi, Inc., the court affirmed the denial of a timely filed application for change of judge, noting that \u201cRule 51.05, relating to application for change of judge, is not to be construed as subverting [dispositive] proceedings already begun by a trial court.\u201d 851 S.W.2d 82, 85 (Mo. App. E.D. 1993). Finally, in Elrod v. Stewart, we distinguished Jenkins (and reversed the trial court's ruling refusing to grant the application for change of judge) by noting that in the Elrod case, unlike Jenkins, \u201c[a]t the time of the filing of Appellant's [timely] application for change of judge \u2024 , no matter was under submission to the trial court.\u201d 163 S.W.3d 587, 592 (Mo. App. W.D. 2005). \n \nHere, not only had the dispositive proceeding been submitted to the trial court, the trial court had already ruled upon the dispositive issue and entered judgment. To permit Father to obtain a change of judge after judgment has been entered by the trial court would subvert the proceedings below and produce an absurd result. This we will not do. \n \nAccordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Father's application for change of judge after judgment had already been entered by the trial court. \n \nPoint II is denied. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe trial court's judgment is affirmed. \n \nFOOTNOTES \n \n1 .  \u2003As we explained in Ketteman v. Ketteman, 347 S.W.3d 647 (Mo. App. W.D. 2011), the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (\u201cUCCJEA\u201d) \u201cprioritizes various interests to facilitate a determination of which of the various courts should exercise its jurisdiction and which should refrain from exercising its jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 653-54. \n \n2 .  \u2003The UCCJEA is codified in sections 452.700 through 452.930 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri. All statutory citations refer to Revised Statutes of Missouri 2000, as supplemented, unless otherwise indicated. \n \n3 .  \u2003As a general rule, \u201ca dismissal without prejudice is not a final judgment and, therefore, is not appealable.\u201d K.M.J. v. M.A.J., 363 S.W.3d 172, 175 (Mo. App. E.D. 2012). However, \u201c[a]n appeal from such a dismissal [without prejudice] can be taken where the dismissal has the practical effect of terminating the litigation in the form cast or in the plaintiff's chosen forum.\u201d Id. Such a situation arises when\u2014as in the present case\u2014a circuit court dismisses a paternity and child support action for lack of jurisdiction, and that dismissal has the practical effect of terminating the litigation in the plaintiff's chosen forum. See generally id. Thus, the circuit court's dismissal of Father's suit without prejudice was a final judgment capable of review on appeal because it had the practical effect of terminating the suit in Father's chosen forum, Missouri. \n \n4 .  \u2003\u201cHome state\u201d is defined as:[T]he state in which a child has lived with a parent or a person acting as a parent for at least six consecutive months immediately prior to the commencement of a child custody proceeding. \u2024 A period of temporary absence of any of the mentioned persons is part of such period[.]§ 452.705(8). \n \n5 .  \u2003Father himself pointed to pleadings in an unrelated Kansas lawsuit in which a Kansas assistant district prosecutor had referenced an address for Mother in Missouri; however, that same pleading referenced that Child was then both residing with Mother and attending the public schools of the State of Kansas. \n \n6 .  \u2003In pertinent part, Rule 51.05 provides that \u201c[a] change of judge shall be ordered in any civil action upon the timely filing of a written application therefor by a party. \u2024 The application must be filed within 60 days from service of process or 30 days from the designation of the trial judge, whichever time is longer.\u201d Rule 51.05(a)-(b). Here, Mother was not served and instead voluntarily waived service and entered her appearance on November 19, 2015. Hence, Father claims that his application for change of judge on December 18, 2015, fell within the longer 60-day time limit, albeit after the trial court had already issued its judgment. \n \nMark D.

Charlene Lipsey of the United States won in 2:02.01. \n \n\u201cThe plan was to get out and stay out,\u201d Watson said. \u201cIt was fun, I was really excited, because I wasn't expected to win. It was more relaxed and I wasn't going for a record or anything, just looking for an indoor personal record, and I got one.\u201d \n \nWatson's 800 time is No. 3 in U.S. prep history. Watson set a national high school indoor record Jan. 21 in the 600 (1:28.67) at the Section 5 vs. Section 6  \u2013  Battle of the West Invitational at Houghton College.  \n \n\u201cThat helped with my mindset,\u201d Watson said of the 600. \u201cI think my fitness is at a good spot right now. I'm happy how my training is going.\u201d \n \nWatson, who has yet to decide on a college, said she's making two more visits.The thought of turning professional for the senior isn't a thought quite yet. \n \n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI want to at least win an NCAA title or break 2:00 (first).\u201d \n \nIn the junior boys mile, Josh Hoey of Bishop Shanahan PA, overtook favorite DJ Principe of La Salle Academy RI to win in 4:09.26.  \n \n\u201cJust wanted to stay within reaching distance of the leader throughout the race, about two to three seconds behind, and then with 250-300 meters to go, try and challenge for the lead, and I was able to do that,\u201d Hoey said. \n \nPrincipe entered Saturday's mile after posting a personal-best 4:00.97 at the New Balance Games at The Armory in New York competing Jan. 21 against professionals. The recovery, mixed in with illness, has made for a tougher-than-normal week, resulting in him running 4:12.34.  \n \n\u201cCertainly never pushed myself to that extreme,\u201d Principe said.  \n \nPrincipe will race in the second heat of the NYRR Millrose Games mile Feb. 11 at The Armory.  \n \n\u201cI think that was a really big confidence booster,\u201d Principe said of getting so close to breaking 4:00. \n \n\u201cI was hesitant to get up toward the front of the group at the race last week, and looking back at it now, I wonder what would have happened if I had been a little more aggressive in the first two laps.\u201d \n \nIn the girls junior mile, Jackie Gaughan of Exeter NH won in 4:52.57. \n \nGaughan, a junior, is coming off a breakout cross country season that saw her finish runner-up at the Foot Locker Northeast Regional and 11th at the Foot Locker National Championships.  \n \n\u201cThe atmosphere here is a lot like some of the championship meets, I think that helped,\u201d Gaughan said.  \n \nKnown more for long-distance performances, the mile was a bit of uncharted territory for Gaughan.   \n \n\u201cYeah, the last lap I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm in first.' And I was just trying to stay where I was,\u201d she said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"News - New Balance Indoor Grand Prix 2017 High School Recap","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"RunnerSpace.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"182036737","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"52"},"name":"RunnerSpace.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.runnerspace.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196420207","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:46:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

NEWTON COUNTY, Employer/Appellant. TREASURER OF MISSOURI AS CUSTODIAN OF SECOND INJURY FUND, Additional Party. \n No. SD34269      Decided: January 17, 2017  Appellant's Attorney: Alexander L. Wulff and Richard L. Montgomery, Jr., of Columbia, Missouri Respondent's Attorney: Timothy John Wise, of Springfield, Missouri \nNewton County (\u201cEmployer\u201d) appeals the \u201cFinal Award Allowing Compensation\u201d (\u201cFinal Award\u201d) of the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) finding Terry Lankford (\u201cLankford\u201d) permanently and totally disabled, and concluding Employer was liable for his benefits. As Lankford was deceased at the time of the Final Award, the benefits were awarded to his wife, Carol Lankford (\u201cMrs. Lankford\u201d). We affirm the decision of the Commission. \n \nFactual and Procedural Background \n \nLankford began working for Employer on August 17, 1987. Over the years, he worked a number of positions for Employer. In approximately 1998, Lankford began working in the prosecutor's office as an investigator. \n \nIn 2002, Lankford was exposed to anhydrous ammonia while investigating a mobile meth lab. He had no breathing problems prior to this exposure. Thereafter, he was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\u201cCOPD\u201d). \n \nWhen Lankford began work at the prosecutor's office, he smoked in the area in the basement provided by Employer. He began going up on the roof to smoke at the suggestion of an assistant prosecutor. After that, he preferred the roof because it was quiet and he could think about the case he was working on. The roof of the courthouse was a popular place for pigeons, and pigeon droppings accumulated there. While on the roof, other deputies, investigators, and city detectives would seek Lankford out to talk to him about work-related matters. \n \nLankford left his job with Employer in December 2007, after lung surgery and a subsequent stroke left him unable to work. On April 11, 2008, Lankford filed a Claim for Compensation asserting that during the course and scope of his employment with Employer, he was exposed to pigeon droppings and as a result, sustained injury to his lungs and respiratory system. Employer filed an answer to the claim for compensation disputing the allegations therein. Lankford gave his deposition on January 21, 2009. \n \nOn June 15, 2012, Lankford died due to complications of pneumonia and COPD. On or about September 6, 2012, a \u201cSuggestion of Death\u201d was filed notifying the Division of Workers' Compensation (\u201cthe Division\u201d) of Lankford's death. Thereafter, a \u201cMotion for Substitution\u201d was filed and Mrs. Lankford was substituted as \u201cclaimant.\u201d \n \nOn January 9, 2015, a hearing was held before the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). The Lankfords' testimony, as well as the medical evidence, were all submitted through depositions, medical records, and medical reports. \n \nLankford's Testimony \n \nLankford testified consistent with the facts set forth above. In addition, Lankford testified he had been married to Mrs. Lankford for 39 years. Lankford had a son and a daughter, but neither relied on him for support. \n \nLankford worked for Employer for approximately 21 years, his last position being an investigator for the prosecutor's office. Lankford's duties as an investigator were to track down and interview victims and witnesses. He would also help \u201cthe girls around the office[.]\u201d \n \nAfter being diagnosed with COPD in 2002, Lankford experienced intermittent shortness of breath and had several bouts of bronchitis and pneumonia. His symptoms worsened prior to his diagnosis in December 2007 of a right lung nodule believed to be cancerous. \n \nOn December 22, 2007, Lankford underwent surgery to remove the nodule and half of his right lung (lobectomy procedure), which was then found to be non-cancerous, but rather identified as \u201ccryptococcus.\u201d 1 After surgery, Lankford was placed in an induced coma. Lankford suffered a stroke sometime while in the induced coma, which resulted in right-sided weakness. After regaining consciousness, Lankford had severe problems with his hands that proved to be bilateral carpal tunnel requiring surgery. Lankford also had trouble walking necessitating the use of a cane, and experienced continued problems with speech and breathing. \n \nMrs. Lankford's Testimony \n \nMrs. Lankford's deposition was taken on March 13, 2014. Mrs. Lankford testified she visited her husband at the prosecutor's office about once a month for lunch. She would sometimes meet him on the rooftop where she would smoke and visit with him. Lankford's co-workers would sometimes come up to discuss work when she was there. She described the roof as a 12-by-20-foot area with railings around three sides. She observed pigeon droppings on the railings and walls. \n \nDr. Allen Parmet's Testimony \n \nThe deposition of Dr. Allen Parmet (\u201cDr. Parmet\u201d), board certified in occupational medicine and aeronautic medicine, was taken on November 16, 2009. Dr. Parmet testified consistent with his report. He testified that at the request of Lankford's attorney, he performed a medical evaluation of Lankford, and authored a report on August 11, 2008. Dr. Parmet explained that the nodule removed from Lankford's right lung was biopsied, which disclosed two identifiable infectious diseases: a fungus known as \u201cCryptococcus laurentii\u201d (\u201cCrypto\u201d) and a bacteria called \u201cMycobacterium avium intracellulare\u201d 2 (\u201cMAI\u201d). Dr. Parmet opined that the Crypto and MAI arose from Lankford's repeated and periodic exposure to the pigeon droppings during his employment with Employer, and his occupational activities at Employer were the prevailing factor in causing the Crypto and MAI. He opined the lobectomy was necessary to treat those conditions and the surgical complication\u2014Lankford's stroke\u2014was a direct consequence of the treatment Lankford received for the two infections. \n \nDr. Parmet concluded that Lankford had reached maximum medical improvement as of the time of his examination and was permanently and totally disabled due to the effects of the stroke \u201csince he's got hemiparesis, he's got contractures, and he's got cognitive dysfunction,\u201d and \u201c[t]his [was] not something that you could take a person and readily put them back to work under any circumstances.\u201d It was Dr. Parmet's opinion, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Lankford was permanently and totally disabled solely from the stroke, which was a direct result of the Crypto and MIA, and independent of all Lankford's prior problems. \n \nDr. Paul M. Jost's Testimony \n \nThe deposition of Dr. Paul M. Jost (\u201cDr. Jost\u201d), a board certified infectious disease physician, was taken on December 1, 2010. Dr. Jost testified consistent with his report. Dr. Jost evaluated Lankford on May 25, 2010, at the request of Employer. Dr. Jost concluded that, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, Lankford did not suffer from Crypto, but rather from MAI. He did not think the MAI was caused by Lankford's exposure to pigeon droppings during his employment with Employer because the MAI \u201corganism is so prevalent in the environment that [Lankford] could have picked it up on numerous possible occasions and to tie it to one specific location at this time would basically be impossible.\u201d However, on cross-examination, Dr. Jost agreed that Lankford could have been exposed to MAI through his employment with Employer, and that he could not rule out Lankford's work as a source of his exposure to MAI. \n \nDr. Hunter Hofmann's February 15, 2014 Medical Evaluation Report \n \nDr. Hunter Hofmann's (\u201cDr. Hofmann\u201d) February 15, 2014 report was entered into evidence. Dr. Hofmann was board certified in internal medicine, and reviewed Lankford's medical records at the request of Employer. In that report, Dr. Hofmann concurred with the findings of Lankford's infectious disease doctor, Dr. Eden Esquerra, that Lankford did not suffer from Crypto, but suffered only from MAI. Dr. Hofmann opined that it was Lankford's cigarette smoking that was the primary cause of his pulmonary conditions, including the contraction of MAI. However, Dr. Hofmann noted it was \u201calso possible that [Lankford] was exposed [to MAC\u2009 3 ] with his habit of taking smoking breaks.\u201d Dr. Hofmann concluded that the diagnosis of MAI was what resulted in Lankford's lobectomy in December 2007. \n \nDr. Allen Parmet's June 11, 2014 Report \n \nDr. Parmet authored a second report dated June 11, 2014, which was admitted into evidence. This report was issued after Dr. Parmet's review of additional materials, including the reports of Dr. Hofmann and Dr. Jost. Dr. Parmet stated that his opinions were unchanged. He noted that while Dr. Hofmann and Dr. Jost agreed Lankford did not suffer from Crypto, the MAI infection \u201cclearly was present.\u201d He further noted that \u201c[t]he subsequent complications of [Lankford] \u2024 stems from the evaluation of the fungal infection and biopsy, which resulted in the complication.\u201d Dr. Parmet concluded that: \n \nWhile smoking is certainly the initial cause of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which potentiated the infection, my opinion remains that [Lankford]'s occupational exposure at the Newton County Courthouse was the most likely cause of his MAC infection and therefore ultimately rendered him Permanently and Totally Disabled and led to his death. Clearly, his pre-existing pulmonary conditions and other pre-existing problems were contributing factors and hastened his demise. \n \nDr. Eden Esguerra's July 15, 2011 Report \n \nDr. Eden Esguerra (\u201cDr. Esguerra\u201d), an infectious disease specialist, first saw Lankford in December 2007, after he underwent a right upper lung lobectomy. The cultural from the right upper lobe was positive for Crypto. Lankford was then treated with appropriate medication. He completed treatment with her in December 2009. In April 2011, Lankford resumed treatment with Dr. Esguerra. It was Dr. Esguerra's opinion that Lankford likely acquired Crypto through inhalation. She opined that it was possible that \u201chis job at the Sheriff's Department may have put him at risk of contracting the [Crypto] infection.\u201d She last saw Lankford on April 19, 2011. \n \nDr. Hofmann's September 1, 2014 Report \n \nDr. Hofmann was asked to review Dr. Parmet's June 11, 2014 report and Mrs. Lankford's deposition testimony. He concluded that neither Dr. Parmet's report, nor Mrs. Lankford's deposition testimony changed his opinion from his previous report of February 15, 2014, wherein he opined that it was Lankford's smoking that led to his \u201cstructural lung disease and COPD, which predisposed him to his subsequent MAI infection,\u201d and subsequent medical complications. \n \nThe ALJ's Award \n \nThe ALJ's Award was filed on March 3, 2015. The ALJ found that the totality of the evidence clearly established a probability that Lankford's occupational activities at Employer caused the MAI; that he experienced a greater risk of exposure to contracting MAI during his employment with Employer than in his non-work activities; and that Dr. Parmet's opinion regarding exposure and causation were more persuasive than the opinions of Dr. Hofmann and Dr. Jost. \n \nThe ALJ concluded that Lankford contracted an occupational disease\u2014MAI\u2014as a result of his exposure to pigeon droppings, during the course of his employment with Employer, and that such exposure was the prevailing factor in causing both Lankford's condition and disability, which ultimately led to his stroke rendering him permanently and totally disabled. \n \nThe ALJ found Lankford reached maximum medical improvement as of August 7, 2008. The ALJ ordered Employer to pay to Lankford the sum of $167,811.62 as past permanent total disability benefits. The ALJ also ordered Employer to pay to Mrs. Lankford the sum of $502.43 per week for ongoing permanent total disability benefits for the remainder of her life. The ALJ found no liability on the part of the Second Injury Fund. 4 \n \nEmployer filed an \u201cApplication for Review\u201d with the Commission on March 19, 2015. \n \nCommission's Final Award \n \nThe Commission affirmed the ALJ's Award, and incorporated the ALJ's Award and findings into the Commission's Final Award. \n \nIn addition, the Commission's Final Award found that Employer's argument that Lankford failed to show he was exposed to the pathogens that caused his occupational disease to a greater extent or degree than workers in a normal, nonemployment life, was not persuasive, particularly Employer's \u201cunequal exposure\u201d requirement argument. 5 \n \nThe Commission found that the \u201cunequal exposure\u201d requirement to which the Employer referred was found in section 287.020.3(2): 6 \n \nAn injury shall be deemed to arise out of and in the course of the employment only if: \n \n(a) It is reasonably apparent, upon consideration of all the circumstances, that the accident is the prevailing factor in causing the injury; and \n \n(b) It does not come from a hazard or risk unrelated to the employment to which workers would have been equally exposed outside of and unrelated to the employment in normal nonemployment life. \n \nIn contrast, the Commission found that the criteria for compensability of an injury by occupational disease, is set forth in section 287.067.1&.2: \n \n1. In this chapter the term \u201coccupational disease\u201d is hereby defined to mean, unless a different meaning is clearly indicated by the context, an identifiable disease arising with or without human fault out of and in the course of the employment. Ordinary diseases of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment shall not be compensable, except where the diseases follow as an incident of an occupational disease as defined in this section. The disease need not to have been foreseen or expected but after its contraction it must appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment and to have flowed from that source as a rational consequence. \n \n2. An injury by occupational disease is compensable only if the occupational exposure was the prevailing factor in causing both the resulting medical condition and disability. The \u201cprevailing factor\u201d is defined to be the primary factor, in relation to any other factor, causing both the resulting medical condition and disability. Ordinary, gradual deterioration, or progressive degeneration of the body caused by aging or by the normal activities of day-to-day living shall not be compensable. \n \nThe Commission found that in applying the plain language of sections 287.020.3 and section 287.067, which must be strictly construed pursuant to section 287.800.1, it could not impose the \u201cunequal exposure\u201d requirement found in section 287.020.3 to this claim because the statutory language contained no such requirement. \n \nThe Commission further found that in evaluating claims of injury by occupational disease, it could no longer refer to the criteria for a compensable injury by accident under sections 287.020.2 and 287.020.3, and following the 2005 amendments to Chapter 287, it was sufficient for Lankford to demonstrate that the disease he suffered was not an \u2018\u2009\u201cordinary disease of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment.\u201d\u2009\u2019 This appeal followed. \n \nIn three points on appeal, Employer asserts: (1) the Commission erred as a matter of law in holding that the \u201cunequal exposure\u201d requirement found in section 287.020.3 is not applicable to a claim alleging an injury by occupational disease; (2) the Commission erred in finding that Lankford's injury arose out of and in the course of his employment; and (3) the Commission erred in finding Lankford suffered an injury by occupational disease. \n \nStandard of Review \n \nA reviewing court may modify, reverse, remand for rehearing, or set aside a workers' compensation award upon a finding that: (1) the commission acted without or in excess of its powers; (2) the award was procured by fraud; (3) the commission's factual findings do not support the award; or (4) there was not sufficient competent evidence in the record to warrant the making of the award. Section 287.495.1. Whether the award is supported by competent and substantial evidence is judged by examining the evidence in the context of the whole record. \n \nQuestions of law are reviewed de novo. This Court must defer to the commission's findings on issues of fact, the credibility of the witnesses, and the weight given to conflicting evidence. The determination of whether an accident is the \u201cprevailing factor\u201d causing a claimant's condition is an inherently factual one. Although the commission's decision is afforded substantial deference, this Court must still examine the whole record to determine if it contains sufficient competent and substantial evidence to support the award, i.e., whether the award is contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence. \n \nMalam v. Dep't of Corr., 492 S.W.3d 926, 928 (Mo. banc 2016) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \n \n\u201cThis Court may not substitute its judgment on the evidence, and when the evidence before an administrative body would warrant either of two opposed findings, the reviewing court is bound by the administrative determination, and it is irrelevant that there is supportive evidence for the contrary finding.\u201d Greer v. SYSCO Food Servs., 475 S.W.3d 655, 665 (Mo. banc 2015). \n \nAnalysis \n \nPoint I: Applicability of \u201cUnequal Exposure\u201d to Injury by Occupational Disease \n \nIn its first point, Employer argues that the Commission erred as a matter of law in holding that the \u201cunequal exposure\u201d requirement in section 287.020.3 is not applicable to a claim alleging an injury by occupational disease. \n \nUnder section 287.020.3(2) 7 : \n \n(2) An injury shall be deemed to arise out of and in the course of the employment only if: \n \n(a) It is reasonably apparent, upon consideration of all the circumstances, that the accident is the prevailing factor in causing the injury; and \n \n(b) It does not come from a hazard or risk unrelated to the employment to which workers would have been equally exposed outside of and unrelated to the employment in normal nonemployment life. \n \nThe criteria for the compensability of an injury by occupational disease are set forth in section 287.067, which provides in relevant part that: \n \n1. In this chapter the term \u201coccupational disease\u201d is hereby defined to mean, unless a different meaning is clearly indicated by the context, an identifiable disease arising with or without human fault out of and in the course of the employment. Ordinary diseases of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment shall not be compensable, except where the diseases follow as an incident of an occupational disease as defined in this section. The disease need not to have been foreseen or expected but after its contraction it must appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment and to have flowed from that source as a rational consequence. \n \n2. An injury or death by occupational disease is compensable only if the occupational exposure was the prevailing factor in causing both the resulting medical condition and disability. The \u201cprevailing factor\u201d is defined to be the primary factor, in relation to any other factor, causing both the resulting medical condition and disability. Ordinary, gradual deterioration, or progressive degeneration of the body caused by aging or by the normal activities of day-to-day living shall not be compensable. \n \n(Emphasis in original). \n \n\u201cThe Workers' Compensation Law distinguishes between two general categories of compensable injuries: (1) injuries by accident; and (2) injuries by occupational disease.\u201d State ex rel. KCP & L Greater Missouri Operations Co. v. Cook, 353 S.W.3d 14, 18 (Mo.App. W.D. 2011). \n \nThe Commission made specific findings interpreting these provisions: \n \nApplying the plain language of the foregoing statutory provisions (which we must strictly construe by virtue of § 287.800.1 RSMo) we cannot impose the \u201cunequal exposure\u201d requirement found in § 287.020.3 to this claim, because the foregoing language contains no such requirement. We note that the legislature amended § 287.067.2 in 2005 to remove language requiring that an occupational disease \u201cmeet the requirements of an injury which is compensable as provided in subsections 2 and 3 of section 287.020,\u201d as well as language providing that \u201c[a]n occupational disease is not compensable merely because work was a triggering or precipitating factor.\u201d The obvious intent and effect of this amendment is clear: in evaluating claims of injury by occupational disease, we must no longer refer to the criteria for a compensable injury by accident under §§ 287.020.2 and 287.020.3. \n \nAccordingly, we conclude that the recent cases discussing the \u201cunequal exposure\u201d requirement under § 287.020.3, e.g., Johme v. St. John's Mercy Healthcare, 366 S.W.3d 504 (Mo. 2012), and Miller v. Mo. Highway & Transp. Comm'n, 287 S.W.3d 671 (Mo. 2009), are not applicable to this claim alleging an injury by occupational disease. Instead, following the 2005 amendments to Chapter 287, it is sufficient for employee to demonstrate that the disease he suffered is not an \u201cordinary disease of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment.\u201d \n \nBy all accounts, the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in employee's lungs was not an \u201cordinary disease of life.\u201d Rather, the medical experts agree it is an extremely rare disease that is typically only seen in individuals with compromised immune systems. As a result, we conclude that employee's MAC qualifies as an \u201coccupational disease\u201d under the law, and is compensable if employee is able to prove the other requisite elements, namely that the disease (1) had its origin in a risk connected with the employment; (2) flowed from that source as a rational consequence; and (3) that employee's occupational exposure was the prevailing factor in causing both the resulting medical condition and disability. \n \nWe have carefully reviewed the medical opinions relevant to these factual issues[.] \u2024 [T]he administrative law judge capably sorted through the conflicting expert testimony, and we discern no need to disturb his well-reasoned analysis. \n \nWe agree with the Commission's well-reasoned discussion on these matters. The legislature's 2005 amendment to section 287.067.2 removed language requiring that an occupational disease \u201cmeet[\u2009] the requirements of an injury which is compensable as provided in subsections 2 and 3 of section 287.020[,]\u201d as well as language providing that \u201c[a]n occupational disease is not compensable merely because work was a triggering or precipitating factor.\u201d The legislature's obvious intent was to, in evaluating occupational disease, remove from consideration the criteria for a compensable injury by accident under sections 287.020.2 and 287.020.3. The other districts of this Court that have examined this issue have reached the same conclusion. See KCP & L, 353 S.W.3d at 24, Amesquita v. Gilster-Mary Lee Corp, 408 S.W.3d 293 (Mo.App. E.D. 2013). \n \nThe Commission did not misinterpret or misconstrue the law in its application of section 287.067. See section 287.495.1. Point I is denied. \n \nPoint II: Award Supported by Competent and Substantial Evidence \n \nIn its second point, Employer argues: \n \nThe Labor and Industrial Relations Commission erred in finding that the employee's injury arose out of and in the course of his employment because it is contrary to the requirements of a compensable injury defined under §\u2002287.020, R.S.Mo., was not supported by competent and substantial evidence and was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence, in that §\u2002287.020, R.S.Mo., states that an injury is only compensable if it arises out of and in the course of employment and the employee's duties as an investigator never required his presence on employer's roof nor did the employer receive any benefit from the employee retreating from his job to the roof to be alone and smoke ten times per day. \n \nThe dictates of Houston v. Crider, 317 S.W.3d 178, 187 (Mo.App. S.D. 2010), apply in the workers' compensation context of determining whether an award is contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence. Jordan v. USF Holland Motor Freight, Inc., 383 S.W.3d 93 (Mo.App. S.D. 2012). Like here, the appellant in Jordan, challenged the award of the Commission under subsection 4 of section 287.495.1. Id. at 95. We indicated in Jordan that: \n \nSuccessful \u201cagainst the weight\u201d challenges, by their nature, involve four steps: \n \n1. Identify a factual proposition needed to sustain the result; \n \n2. Marshal all record evidence supporting that proposition; \n \n3. Marshal contrary evidence of record, subject to the factfinder's credibility determinations, explicit or implicit; and \n \n4. Prove, in light of the whole record, that the step 2 evidence and its reasonable inferences are so non-probative that no reasonable mind could believe the proposition. \n \nId. \n \nWe noted that: \n \nHouston [v. Crider] and its progeny, not being workers compensation cases, involved \u201cagainst the weight\u201d claims. Hampton [v. Big Boy Steel Erection, 121 S.W.3d 220 (Mo. banc 2003),] speaks in terms of \u201coverwhelming weight,\u201d which may reflect a difference in degree, but not in analysis. \n \nJordan, 383 S.W.3d at 95 n.3. \n \nHere, Employer wholly fails to follow the mandatory analytical sequence set forth by Houston. 317 S.W.3d at 187. Such a failure renders Employer's argument analytically useless. Nevertheless, even if we were to evaluate Employer's claim, it would still fail on the merits because the Commission's award was not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. \n \nWe must construe the Workers' Compensation Law as amended in 2005\u2014in so doing, we adhere to the general rules of statutory interpretation. Amesquita, 408 S.W.3d at 299. \u201cThis Court's primary rule of statutory interpretation is to give effect to legislative intent as reflected in the plain language of the statute at issue.\u201d Peters v. Wady Industries, Inc., 489 S.W.3d 784, 789 (Mo. banc 2016) (internal quotation and citation omitted). \u201cIf the intent of the legislature is clear and unambiguous, by giving the language used in the statute its plain and ordinary meaning, then this Court is bound by that intent and cannot resort to any statutory construction in interpreting the statute.\u201d Id. (internal quotations and citations omitted). Pursuant to section 287.800, we must strictly construe the provisions of Chapter 287. \n \nOccupational diseases are acquired over time, not injuries caused by a specific event during a single work shift. Young v. Boone Elec. Coop., 462 S.W.3d 783, 796 (Mo.App. S.D. 2015). \n \nIn KCP & L, the Western District scrutinized the amendments to section 287.067, which define the standards for compensability of occupational disease. The court noted that the legislature eliminated the cross-reference between section 287.067 and section 287.020: \n \nPrior to the 2005 amendments, § 287.067.2, RSMo 2000 provided: \n \nAn occupational disease is compensable if it is clearly work related and meets the requirements of an injury which is compensable as provided in subsections 2 and 3 of section 287.020. An occupational disease is not compensable merely because work was a triggering or precipitating factor. \n \nKCP & L, 353 S.W.3d at 24 (emphasis in original.) \n \nThe 2005 amendments rewrote this provision, so that it now reads: \n \nAn injury by occupational disease is compensable only if the occupational exposure was the prevailing factor in causing both the resulting medical condition and disability. The \u201cprevailing factor\u201d is defined to be the primary factor, in relation to any other factor, causing both the resulting medical condition and disability. Ordinary, gradual deterioration, or progressive degeneration of the body caused by aging or by the normal activities of day-to-day living shall not be compensable. \n \nId. \n \nThe KCP & L court explained that the elimination of the cross-reference to section 287.020 resulted in a stand-alone compensability standard for occupational disease claims in section 287.067, independent of section 287.020. Id. at 24-25. The court reasoned that the creation of an independent compensation scheme for occupational disease provided further evidence of the legislature's intent to remove occupational disease from the narrow definition of \u201caccident.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the Western District concluded that occupational disease is not an \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of Chapter 287 and, therefore, the exclusivity provision for accidental injuries or death does not apply to claims for injuries by occupational disease. Id. at 29-30. \n \nIn 2013, the Eastern District also took up the same issue in Amesquita, 408 S.W.3d at 299, reaching the same conclusion as the court in KCP & L. \n \nEmployer's argument in Point II is premised on the applicability of section 287.020, rather than section 287.067, which governs claims of occupational disease. As the ALJ and the Commission correctly found, under the strict construction required by section 287.800, the unequal exposure requirement for injury\u2009 8 is not part of the occupational disease requirement. \n \nThe second part of Employer's argument requires us to determine whether the Commission erred in finding that Lankford was exposed to MAI/MAC during the course and scope of his employment. \n \nLankford was employed as an investigator in the Employer's prosecutor's office. When Lankford began work at the prosecutor's office, he smoked in the area in the basement provided by Employer. He then began going up on the roof at the suggestion of an assistant prosecutor. After that, he preferred the roof because it was quiet and he could think about the case he was working on. The roof contained a substantial amount of pigeon droppings, owing to the presence of the birds on the roof. The droppings caused a bacterial infection in Lankford's lungs, for which he brought his claim. \n \nThe ALJ's Award, as adopted by the Commission, analyzed the issue as follows: \n \nIt is uncontradicted that [Lankford] was exposed to pigeons and pigeon droppings during the course of his employment. He took smoke breaks, ten times a day, on the roof of the Newton County Courthouse. Both [Lankford and his wife] described that site as one with numerous pigeons and pigeon droppings. Also, during his smoke breaks, [Lankford] discussed with co-employees work activities. His supervisors, the prosecutors, would also discuss cases with him during such smoke breaks. He so testified in his deposition, and also provided a similar history to Dr. Parmet. Mrs. Lankford also described observing [Lankford]'s supervisors discussing work issues with him during the smoke breaks on the roof of the courthouse. That uncontradicted evidence clearly establishes that [Lankford]'s exposure to the pigeons and pigeon droppings arose out of and in the course of his employment with Employer. \n \nThere is some disagreement among the medical experts as to what medical conditions [Lankford] contracted. Dr. Parmet opined that [Lankford] had contracted both Crypto and MAI. However, Dr. Jost and Dr. Hofmann opined that [Lankford] did not suffer from Crypto. However, both doctors agreed that [Lankford] suffered from MAI. Moreover, the experts agreed that the lobectomy, which [Lankford] underwent in December 2007, was necessary to treat the MAI. As opined by Dr. Parmet, [Lankford] suffered a disabling stroke as a result of that surgical procedure. \n \nDr. Parmet opined that the MAI from which [Lankfo1d] suffered arose from his exposure to pigeon droppings during the course of his employment with Employer. Dr. Parmet opined that such exposure was the prevailing factor in causing the MAI. Although Dr. Jost and Dr. Hofmann essentially testified that they could not pinpoint the site of [Lankford]'s exposure to MAI, they acknowledged that it was possible that he had contracted such condition because of his employment at Employer. They both testified that it was possible he was exposed to the risk of contracting MAI during his employment with Employer. \n \nDr. Jost and Dr. Hofmann placed great emphasis on [Lankford]'s longstanding history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\u201cCOPD\u201d). Dr. Parmet also discussed that condition. However, as noted above, the doctors agreed that the condition for which [Lankford] underwent a lobectomy in December 2007 was the MAI and not COPD. \n \nMoreover, Mrs. Lankford testified that [Lankford] was not exposed to pigeons or pigeon droppings outside of work to the extent he was so exposed during his employment with Newton County. A claimant does not have the burden of proof in an occupational disease case such as this to pinpoint the specific exposure Smith v[.] Capital Region Medical Center, 412 S.W.[3d] 252 (Mo. App. 2013). The totality of the evidence clearly establishes a probability that [Lankford]' s occupational activities at Employer caused the MAI. It is clear that he experienced a greater risk of exposure to contracting MAI during his employment with Employer than in his non-work activities. I find Dr. Parmet's opinion regarding exposure and causation to be more persuasive than the opinions of Dr. Jost and Dr. Hofmann. \n \n\u2024 \n \nConsequently, I find and conclude that [Lankford] contracted an occupational disease, MAI, as a result of his exposure to pigeon droppings during the course and scope of his employment with Employer and that such exposure was the prevailing factor in causing both his condition and disability that ultimately led to his stroke which rendered him permanently and totally disabled. \n \nThese conclusions are not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. The Commission did not err in finding that Lankford's injury arose out of and in the course of his employment. Point II is denied. \n \nPoint III: The Commission Was Free to Believe Dr. Parmet \n \nIn its third point, Employer argues as follows: \n \nThe Labor and Industrial Relations Commission erred in finding the employee suffered an injury by occupational disease because such finding is contrary to §\u2002287.067, R.S.Mo., that states ordinary diseases of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment are not compensable; is contrary to §\u2002287.020, R.S.Mo., that does not allow compensation where work was a triggering or precipitating factor and not the prevailing factor, and also requires that the injury come from a risk that the employee would not be equally exposed to outside of employment in normal non-employment life; and the Commission's conclusion and finding of a compensable injury by occupational disease is not supported by competent and substantial evidence and is against the overwhelming weight of the evidence in that every doctor agrees that MAI/MAC was the employee's only pathogen, that MAI/MAC is a widespread common organism that is present throughout the environment in water, soil, dust and even the tobacco the employee smoked over ten times per day such that it is an ordinary disease of life that the employee was at least equally exposed to in normal non-employment life; and there is no evidence that MAI/MAC was even present on the roof in the pigeon droppings or that there was an increased risk where the only doctor to relate the condition to pigeon droppings did so based on the incorrect assumption that the roof was covered and pigeon droppings piled up when in fact the roof was not covered and any pigeon droppings would have washed away. \n \nPoint III, like Points I and II, erroneously presumes the applicability of section 287.020, which, as we have found, does not apply to an occupational disease such as that suffered by Lankford. Further, the argument in Point III fails to follow the mandatory analytical sequence set forth in Houston, 317 S.W.3d at 187. See Jordan, 383 S.W.3d at 95. Such a failure renders Employer's argument analytically useless. Even if these defects were not present, Employer's argument would fail on the merits. \n \nEmployer's argument is essentially that the Commission should have believed the testimony of Dr. Hoffman and Dr. Jost, instead of believing the testimony of Dr. Parmet. \n \nHowever, \u201cwe do not reweigh the evidence; the Commission is the judge of the weight to be given to conflicting evidence and the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Young, 462 S.W.3d at 788 (internal quotation and citation omitted). \n \nThe Commission was entitled to believe Dr. Parmet, and to disbelieve Dr. Hoffman and Dr. Jost. Employer's argument incorrectly asserts that Dr. Parmet ultimately concluded that Lankford did not suffer from Crypto. In his report of June 11, 2014, Dr. Parmet stated that his previously expressed opinions in his report of August 11, 2008, \u201care unchanged, although I do note Dr. Jost's comments regarding [Crypto].\u201d Moreover, in a report of July 15, 2011, Dr. Esquerra did not state that Lankford never suffered from Crypto. As Dr. Esquerra noted, \u201cThe most likely route of acquiring the [Crypto] is through inhalation. It is my understanding that [Lankford] has worked at the sheriff's department. It is possible that his job at the Sheriff's Department may have put him at risk of contracting the [Crypto] infection.\u201d \n \nDr. Parmet initially, and ultimately, opined that Lankford also suffered from MAI/MAC. As Dr. Parmet noted in his report of June 11, 2014, \u201cthe \u2024 (MAC) infection clearly was present. The subsequent complications and ultimate demise of [Lankford] stems from the evaluation of the fungal infection and biopsy, which resulted in a complication.\u201d As Dr. Parmet concluded, the biopsy for the MAI/MAC infection and a complication of that biopsy resulted in Lankford's permanent and total disability. However, the evidence does not show that Dr. Parmet changed his opinion regarding the presence of the Crypto infection. \n \nEmployer also asserts that there was no substantial and competent evidence because Dr. Parmet premised his conclusions on the errant belief that the roof was covered in dried accumulations of pigeon droppings. Dr. Parmet testified he understood that part of the roof was covered, and part of the roof was exposed. He also testified that some of the pigeon droppings would have been washed away by rain. Moreover, Mrs. Lankford testified that she visited Lankford on the rooftop one-hundred-to-one-hundred-twenty times over the years. She described observing pigeon and pigeon droppings on the roof, fresh and dry, each time she visited. This was competent and substantial evidence to support the Commission's decision, and the decision was not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. Point III is denied. \n \nThe Final Award of the Commission is affirmed. \n \nCONCURRING OPINION \n \nThis case illustrates our limited review in workers compensation \u2013 absent legal error, fraud, or unauthorized Commission action, we check for factual and evidentiary support of the award per § 287.495 and Hampton v. Big Boy Steel Erection, 121 S.W.3d 220, 222-23 (Mo. banc 2003). We rarely care how the Commission decided a case except in the few respects § 287.495 allows us to grant relief.

Some influential Afghans counselled caution, warning that Dostum and his armed followers could react violently and urging Ghani to settle the matter through negotiations.\n\nThe president sternly declared he would follow the law, and his attorney general vowed to undertake a thorough, impartial investigation. Repeated letters were sent to Dostum requesting that he and his guards appear for questioning, but they went unanswered.\n\nOn Monday, arrest warrants were issued for nine of his employees, and they were also ignored. Dostum's spokesmen insist he cannot be held accountable.\n\nYet no move has been made to detain Dostum or his men. The first vice-president, who could be suspended from his post by parliament for defying the law, remains sequestered in his fortified compound in a wealthy residential enclave, protected by armed guards and reporting for no official duties. There are also reports that some of the police units in the area are commanded by Dostum loyalists.\n\n\"President Ghani does not have the power to act. You need a strong and serious police commander to go after him,\" said Atiqullah Amarkhail, a retired general.\n\n\"In Afghanistan, there are many centres of power,\" he said. \"The government is divided, and the army and police are loyal to individuals and factions.\"\n\nGovernment officials said they are in no rush to go after Dostum and that they are focused on following proper legal procedures to avoid any suggestion of a political motive.\n\n\"We want to be extremely careful because this is such a sensitive case. It is going to take time,\" one official said. He said Dostum's associates \"understand the gravity of the situation\" and are in discussions on possible ways to comply.\n\nMeanwhile, the government's uncertain relationships with other former warlords are further complicating the tense picture, raising alarms at an unsettled political moment.\n\nEven as the government attempts to bring Dostum to justice, it has invited fugitive militia leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar to return to Kabul in a peace deal, hoping to persuade Taliban insurgents to follow suit.\n\nHekmatyar, a onetime Cold War US ally, turned his forces against the Afghan government a decade ago and was put on a United Nations terrorist list. He was supposed to return only if the UN lifted sanctions against him.\n\nBut this week, his spokesman in Kabul suddenly announced that Hekmatyar plans to come to the capital anyway, reportedly bringing hundreds of armed supporters as he enters national politics.\n\nDavood Moradian, director of the Afghan Institute for Strategic Studies, noted that both Dostum and Hekmatyar have popular followings, have been accused of serious wartime abuses and have never been held accountable. The government must take pains to ensure that Hekmatyar's \"invitation to Kabul is not seen as the state following a political double standard, trying to bring one warlord to justice while unfolding a red carpet to receive the other\", Moradian said.\n\nThe other strongman in this volatile mix is Attah Mohammed Noor, a wealthy northern governor and longtime rival of Dostum, who has been negotiating with Ghani to obtain more influence and status. Noor is seen as a possible replacement for Dostum or Ghani's governing partner, chief executive Abdullah Abdullah, with whom the president has had a rocky relationship . In a recent interview, Noor said that he did not want to prejudge the charges against Dostum, but he called the case shameful.\n\n\"We need the rule of law in Afghanistan, and no one should be above it,\" he said. Noor denied that he was seeking a senior appointment from Ghani, but he expressed concern that Dostum could retaliate against the government by unleashing violence or chaos in the north.\n\nSome Afghan analysts said the politically debilitating charges against Dostum and the likely return of Hekmatyar could lead to dangerous ethnic divisions in the government and possibly strengthen the Taliban.\n\nHekmatyar and Ghani are both ethnic Pashtuns, but Ghani is a Westernised intellectual, while Hekmatyar is a hard-line Islamist who could reinforce rather than help pacify the Taliban.\n\nFor the moment, though, it is Dostum who presents the most immediate challenge to Afghanistan's weak coalition government.\n\nThe longer he remains bunkered in his luxury compound a dozen blocks from the presidential palace, defying legal orders and dragging out the case against him, the more it looks as though the elected government, for all its international backing, is being held hostage by a strongman from another era in Afghan history.\n\nWashington Post","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Pamela Constable"},"topics":[{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Afghanistan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Kabul on edge amid standoff with accused vice-president","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"6004","state":"Western Australia","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"East Perth","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"WA Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169588399","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"27"},"name":"WA Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.watoday.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196423394","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The NFPA 70E 2015 standard states in Section 130.5 that an arc flash risk assessment should be performed and that either of two methods \u2013 but not both \u2013 should be used for the selection of personal protective equipment: method  Arc flash PPE categories method  \nIt is definitely easier to turn to the tables in Section 130.7(C)(15) and 130.7(C)(16), which are based on the type of equipment you are working on and task at hand, to determine what PPE you should wear. However, this is where a lot of the confusion and misunderstanding can come into play. How do you know for certain you can use these tables? \n \nOften overlooked is that NFPA 70E requires the available fault current and clearing time of the protective devices to be known, which is typically not the case. NFPA 70E specifically states that an incident energy analysis should be required for the following: \n Tasks not listed in Table 130.7(C)(15)(A)(a)  Power systems with greater than the estimated maximum available short-circuit current  Power systems with longer than the maximum fault clearing times  Tasks with less than the minimum working distance  \nThe PPE tables were created as a conservative approach to giving guidance to electricians working on electrical equipment without proper signage or that has not had an arc flash study performed. This is typically the case (unfortunately) for contracted workers. The results of improperly using the PPE tables can result in non-compliance. NFPA 70E also states that the owner of the electrical equipment is responsible for having an incident energy analysis performed. In the case of a study not having been performed, the tables should be used on an interim basis until one is completed. \n \nWhen the NFPA 70E tables are used instead of an incident energy analysis, some things to consider are: \n Notes in the tables that have specific requirements for the PPE are generally ignored.  The short-circuit current is assumed.  The protective device clearing time is assumed.  \nAlso, maintenance of the protective devices is not considered, which can definitely affect the incident energy in the event a sticky breaker or such is not opening when it should, so the clearing time of the device would be inaccurate. \n \nIt is also important to understand that the tables and the incident energy calculations are not intended to work together. This is why NFPA 70E has done away with the PPE values and identifies PPE with actual incident energy values for the analysis. Arc flash protective clothing is rated in arc thermal performance value (or ATPV), which is also expressed in cal/cm 2 . Essentially, you need to be certain that the cal/cm 2 rating of the PPE you are wearing is greater than the calculated incident energy (or cal/cm 2 ) of the equipment you are working on. NFPA 70E is setting the tone for the industry to start selecting the PPE based on a cal/cm 2 value instead of a PPE category number. \n \nEditor's note: This article represents the independent views of the author and should not be construed as a National Safety Council endorsement.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Incident energy analysis","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Safety Health Magazine","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"465671275","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"684"},"name":"Safety Health Magazine","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Industrials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.avotraining.com/?gclid=CjwKEAiA8JbEBRCz2szzhqrx7H8SJAC6FjXXLnGmDf71UxfkehS28E2mF2yWCWabt1d96vHoLYB7MRoCCRPw_wcB"],"sequenceId":"695196425167","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

ST. CHARLES COUNTY, MISSOURI, et al., Respondents. \n No. ED104394      Decided: January 24, 2017   \nDid St. Charles County voters lawfully and effectively amend their county charter to prohibit red-light cameras, even within the County's incorporated municipalities? Yes, they did. \n \nWe hold that the county charter amendment is a valid exercise of St. Charles County's broad authority to regulate municipal services and functions under Missouri Constitution article VI, section 18(c), and does not contravene a statewide policy; that the amendment does not violate the county charter; and that the amendment does not invade the province of the judiciary. Furthermore, the proposition appearing on the ballot contained no irregularities of sufficient magnitude to cast doubt on the validity of the election. Consequently, we affirm the trial court's judgment. \n \nFactual and Procedural Background \n \nThe St. Charles County Council adopted Ordinance No. 14-044, submitting to voters a proposed amendment to the county charter that would prohibit the use of \u201cred-light cameras\u201d throughout the county, including within the county's municipalities. In November 2014, St. Charles County presented the following proposition to the county's voters: \n \nPROPOSITION RED LIGHT CAMERA \n \nShall the St. Charles County Charter be amended to add a Section 10.130 reading: \n \n\u201c10.130. Automated Traffic Enforcement Systems. Notwithstanding any other provision of this St. Charles County Charter, red light cameras or similar photograph devices or automated traffic enforcement systems may not be used in enforcing traffic regulations adopted by St. Charles County or by any municipality within St. Charles County that prohibit drivers from entering intersections when controlled by red traffic lights, and no such municipality may exercise the legislative power to use such cameras or devices or systems. This prohibition is the only limit imposed by this Charter upon the County or any municipality within it in performing their functions of regulating traffic and imposes no additional costs that need to be financed.\u201d? \n \nThe St. Charles County Election Authority certified the results of the election. Registered voters approved the charter amendment by a vote of 72.6% in favor and 27.4% opposed. \n \nThe plaintiffs, taxpayers Jim Pepper and Pamela Fogarty, the fourth-class cities of St. Peters and Lake St. Louis, Missouri, and the constitutional charter city of O'Fallon, Missouri (collectively \u201cthe Cities\u201d), filed suit against the defendants, St. Charles County and the Director of Elections of St. Charles County. Two taxpayers who supported the amendment\u2014Carl Bearden and Dan Rakers\u2014later intervened as defendants. (We refer to all defendants collectively as \u201cthe County\u201d). \n \nIn three counts, the Cities sought a declaratory judgment stating that the charter amendment violates the Missouri Constitution and the St. Charles County Charter; sought injunctive relief to prohibit enforcement of the charter amendment; and contested the election, challenging the form of the ballot proposition submitting the charter amendment to the voters. An additional count alleged that the charter amendment impaired the City of St. Peters's contract with a third party. \n \nThe parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court upheld the amendment to the St. Charles County charter prohibiting the use of \u201cred light cameras or similar photograph devices or automated traffic enforcement systems\u201d to enforce traffic regulations, and prohibiting municipalities from \u201cexercis[ing] the legislative power to use such cameras or devices or systems.\u201d The trial court granted summary judgment to the County on the three counts of the Cities' petition seeking declaratory judgment and injunctive relief and contesting the election. The City of St. Peters voluntarily dismissed the petition's remaining count. \n \nThe trial court concluded that the \u201cCharter Amendment does not violate Article VI, sections 18(a), 18(b), and 18(c) of the Missouri constitution and is, therefore, valid and enforceable.\u201d The court also determined that the proposition submitted to the voters complied with the requirement of article VI, section 18(c) that the ballot \u201ccontain a clear definition of the power, function or service to be performed,\u201d and that the proposition language submitted to the voters adequately informed them of the specific activities prohibited. The Cities appeal. The Missouri Municipal League filed an amicus brief in support of the Cities. \n \nStandard of Review \n \nSummary judgment allows a trial court to enter judgment for the moving party where the party demonstrates a right to judgment as a matter of law based on facts about which there is no genuine dispute. ITT Commercial Fin. Corp. v. Mid-Am. Marine Supply Corp., 854 S.W.2d 371, 376 (Mo. banc 1993). Our review is essentially de novo. Id. When considering an appeal from summary judgment, we review the record in the light most favorable to the party against whom the court entered judgment. Id. We can affirm a summary judgment by any appropriate theory supported by the record. Missouri Bankers Assoc., Inc. v. St. Louis County, 448 S.W.3d 267, 270-71 (Mo. banc 2014). \n \nDiscussion \n \nIn eight points on appeal, the Cities claim the trial court erred in granting the County's motion for summary judgment. They challenge the County's authority for the charter amendment under numerous constitutional provisions and the county charter itself; allege that the amendment invades the province of the judiciary; and challenge the validity of the election in which voters passed the amendment. In a ninth point, the Cities appeal the trial court's denial of their motion for summary judgment based on the foregoing arguments. \n \nThe County's Authority for the Charter Amendment \n \nIn six points, the Cities challenge the County's authority for the charter amendment under numerous Missouri constitutional provisions\u2014namely article VI, section 15, relating to classification of cities; article VI, sections 18(a), 18(b), and 18(c), relating to charter counties and their powers; and section 19 of article VI, relating to charter cities such as the City of O'Fallon. The Cities also contend that the amendment violates the county charter itself. \n \nThe rules of statutory construction apply to constitutional provisions, and we give constitutional provisions a broad construction because of their more permanent nature. Chesterfield Fire Protection Dist. v. St. Louis County, 645 S.W.2d 367, 370 (Mo. banc 1983). \u201cThe rules of construction are designed to give effect to the intent and purpose of the provision.\u201d Id. \n \nThe County's power is determined by article VI, section 18 of Missouri's Constitution. K-Mart Corp. v. St. Louis County, 672 S.W.2d 127, 131 (Mo. App. E.D. 1984). Section 18 of article VI first appeared in the 1945 Constitution, and was wholly new. State ex rel. Shepley v. Gamble, 280 S.W.2d 656, 659 (Mo. banc 1955). A charter county functions in a dual capacity because sometimes it performs state functions, and sometimes performs municipal functions. Missouri Bankers, 448 S.W.3d at 272. \n \nSection 18(a) permits a county to adopt a charter for its own government. K-Mart, 672 S.W.2d at 131. Article VI, section 18(a) provides: \n \nAny county having more than 85,000 inhabitants, according to the census of the United States, may frame and adopt and amend a charter for its own government as provided in this article, and upon such adoption shall be a body corporate and politic. In addition and as an alternative to the foregoing, any county which attains first class county status and maintains such status for at least two years shall be authorized to frame and adopt and amend a charter for its own government as provided by this article, and upon such adoption by a vote of the qualified electors of such county shall be a body corporate and politic. Counties which adopt or which have adopted a charter or constitutional form of government shall be a separate class of counties outside of the classification system established under section 8 of this article. \n \nSt. Charles County became a charter county in 1993. \n \nSection 18(b) sets forth the specific provisions that a county charter shall contain. It also provides \u201cthat a charter county shall possess an implied grant of power 'for the exercise of all powers and duties of counties and county officers prescribed by the constitution and laws of the state \u2024\u201d' Missouri Bankers, 448 S.W.3d at 271. Section 18(b) states in full: \n \nThe charter shall provide for its amendment, for the form of the county government, the number, kinds, manner of selection, terms of office and salaries of the county officers, and for the exercise of all powers and duties of counties and county officers prescribed by the constitution and laws of the state; however, such charter shall, except for the charter of any county with a charter form of government and with more than six hundred thousand but fewer than seven hundred thousand inhabitants, require the assessor of the county to be an elected officer. \n \nThe power described in section 18(b) is limited in that a charter or ordinance enacted under this section may not \u201cinvade the province of general legislation involving the public policy of the state as a whole.\u201d Id. (quoting Flower Valley Shopping Ctr., Inc. v. St. Louis County, 528 S.W.2d 749, 754 (Mo. banc 1975)). The current dispute, however, does not involve the implied power contained in section 18(b); rather, it involves the express power granted to charter counties in section 18(c). \n \nArticle VI, section 18(c) is key to resolution of this case. Section 18(c) sets forth the provisions authorized in county charters, namely the county's participation in the government of other local units. Hardy v. Fire Standards Comm'n, 992 S.W.2d 330, 334 (Mo. App. E.D. 1999). Section 18(c) provides as follows. \n \nThe charter may provide for the vesting and exercise of legislative power pertaining to any and all services and functions of any municipality or political subdivision, except school districts, in the part of the county outside incorporated cities; and it may provide, or authorize its governing body to provide, the terms upon which the county may contract with any municipality or political subdivision in the county and perform any of the services and functions of any such municipality or political subdivision. \n \nThe charter may provide for the vesting and exercise of legislative power pertaining to any and all services and functions of any municipality or political subdivision, except school districts, throughout the entire county within as well as outside incorporated municipalities; any such charter provision shall set forth the limits within which the municipalities may exercise the same power collaterally and coextensively. When such a proposition is submitted to the voters of the county the ballot shall contain a clear definition of the power, function or service to be performed and the method by which it will be financed. \n \n(Emphasis added). \n \nAs amended in 1970, article VI, section 18(c) of the Missouri Constitution grants the County broad \u201clegislative power pertaining to any and all services and functions of any municipality or political subdivision, except school districts, throughout the entire county within as well as outside incorporated municipalities.\u201d MO. CONST. art. VI, sec. 18(c); Missouri Bankers, 448 S.W.3d at 272. A \u201cfunction\u201d is all of the activity appropriate to the nature of political subdivisions or municipalities that combine to produce services, which are those acts performed by political subdivisions or municipalities for the benefit of the general public. Chesterfield Fire Protection Dist., 645 S.W.2d at 371. \n \nThe police power is one of the powers delegated to charter counties by the state pursuant to article VI, section 18(c). Missouri Bankers, 448 S.W.3d at 272. Our Courts have held that generally the function of the police power is to promote the welfare, health, and safety of the people by regulating all threats either to the comfort, safety, and welfare of the citizenry or harmful to the public interest. Id. A charter county's exercise of the police power delegated by the state under article VI, section 18(c) is a governmental function. Id. \n \nSeveral Missouri decisions support the proposition that \u201cthe police powers delegated to a charter county are constitutional grants of authority that are not subject to, but take precedence over, the legislative power.\u201d Id. Nonetheless, the County remains a legal subdivision of the state, and consequently, it can control only matters of distinctly local concern, and at the same time must act in harmony with the general law when it touches upon matters of state policy. Id. \n \nThe Cities argue that state law delegates exclusive authority to control traffic on city streets to the cities, and likewise limits counties' legislative power regarding traffic control to unincorporated areas of the counties. Further, the Cities argue, no state law authorizes a county to regulate traffic within the boundaries of any incorporated municipality. \n \nThe Cities cite the unhelpful case of State ex rel Audrain County v. City of Mexico, 197 S.W.2d 301 (Mo. 1946), for the proposition that state law grants exclusive authority over city streets to the cities. Although decided the year after adoption of the Constitution of 1945, Audrain County makes no reference to section 18 of article VI. Furthermore, our Supreme Court decided Audrain County decades before the amendment of section 18(c) in 1970, which added the second paragraph, which expressly provides that \u201c[t]he charter may provide for the vesting and exercise of legislative power pertaining to any and all services and functions of any municipality or political subdivision, except school districts, throughout the entire county within as well as outside incorporated municipalities \u2024\u201d MO. CONST. art. VI, sec. 18(c). Referring to the \u201cwholly new\u201d section 18, our Supreme Court stated that \u201c[b]ecause of the novel provisions of the section, prior decisions are of little help.\u201d Shepley, 280 S.W.2d at 659. We agree with our Supreme Court's assessment of the caselaw. We place no reliance on Audrain County. \n \nThe Cities also rely on sections 304,120 RSMo. (Supp. 2013), 82.190 RSMo. (2000),\u2009 1 and 88.670 RSMo. (2000) to argue that they have exclusive control over traffic on their streets. Section 304,120 RSMo. (Supp. 2013) provides that \u201c[municipalities, by ordinance, may\u201d establish traffic regulations that, inter alia, set speed limits, establish one-way streets, require traffic to stop before crossing intersections, limit use of designated streets to passenger vehicles, regulate parking on the street, require the use of signaling devices, prohibit sound-producing warning devices other than forward-directed horns, and establish additional traffic regulations to meet municipal needs and traffic conditions. Nowhere does section 304, 120 RSMo. (Supp. 2013) say that cities have exclusive control over all traffic regulation on city streets. \n \nSection 82.190 states that \u201c[s]uch [constitutional charter] city shall have exclusive control over its public highways, streets, avenues, alleys and public places, and shall have exclusive power, by ordinance, to vacate or abandon any public highway, street, avenue, alley or public place \u2024\u201d Section 88.670 relates to the powers of fourth-class cities to make public improvements. This section grants fourth-class cities the power to enact ordinances to: (1) levy and collect property taxes; and (2) open and improve streets, make sidewalks, and build bridges, culverts, drains, and sewers. Sec. 88.670.1. It grants fourth-class cities \u201cexclusive control over all streets, alleys, avenues and public highways within the limits of such city.\u201d Sec. 88.670.3. The language of sections 82.190 and 88.670 pertain to a municipality's exclusive authority over the physical property that comprises city streets. \n \nEven were we to construe the cited statutes to grant cities exclusive authority over regulation of traffic on city streets, the referenced statutes do not grant exclusive control over all matters related to regulation of traffic-enforcement mechanisms on city streets, which is a critical distinction. Traffic-enforcement mechanisms that are not necessarily traffic regulations\u2014for example, laws governing the use of DWI checkpoints or radar and laser units\u2014do not regulate traffic, but rather govern how traffic regulation may be enforced. Similarly, the charter amendment here does not seek to regulate traffic on city streets, but addresses how the regulations may be enforced. Specifically, it provides that \u201cred light cameras or similar photograph devices or automated traffic enforcement systems may not be used in enforcing traffic regulations.\u201c (Emphases added.) The charter amendment does not purport to regulate traffic directly. It does not seek to tell cities how to set speed limits, where to place traffic signals and signs, where to establish one-way streets, how to restrict certain kinds of traffic, how to control parking, and the like. \n \nThe Cities also maintain that the charter amendment violates the limits of article VI, section 18(c) because it addresses a matter of statewide concern\u2014rather than a matter of purely local concern\u2014and is out of harmony with the general laws of the state on this matter of statewide public policy. Missouri cases provide little clarity about what constitutes a matter of purely local concern and what constitutes a matter of statewide policy. What this general rule arguably seeks to promote, however, is uniformity throughout the state by distinguishing between uniquely local concerns and matters that merit a uniform approach statewide. We recognize that sometimes a charter county's power under article VI, section 18(c) must yield to statewide policy. With regard to red-light cameras and similar automated traffic-control devices, however, we find no statewide policy exists. \n \nMissouri has no state statute pertaining to red-light cameras or similar devices. State Laws, States, Missouri, GOVERNORS HIGHWAY SAFETY ASS'N, available at http://www.ghsa.org/state-laws/states/missouri (last visited Jan. 4, 2017). 2 Our research reveals that between 2000 and 2016, the Missouri legislature introduced some 47 bills pertaining to red-light cameras, which are set forth in the appendix. The bills variously allowed ten cities to be designated for installation of red-light cameras, prohibited red-light cameras, required revenue generated from red-light camera enforcement to go to local school districts, set limits on the amount of fines allowed for violations, required red-light cameras to photograph the driver from the front, prohibited photographs of the driver's face, prohibited photographs of the vehicle's front license plate, required criminal prosecution and the assessment of points against the operator's driver's license for violations, and exempted red-light camera violations from the point-assessment system. None of these bills has become law. In addition, as of this writing, one bill is pending in the Missouri legislature to submit to voters a measure prohibiting the use of automated traffic-enforcement systems, and requiring political subdivisions to complete or terminate automated traffic-enforcement contracts within one year. H.B. 275, 99th Gen. Assemb. 1st Reg. Sess. (Mo. 2017), available at http://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/billsl71/hlrbillspdf/0834h.01i.pdf(last visited Jan. 9, 2017). \n \nThe Cities urge that the decisions of the Missouri Supreme Court in Missouri Bankers and this Court in State ex rel. American Eagle Waste Industries v. St. Louis County, 272 S.W.3d 336 (Mo. App. E.D. 2008), mandate reversal of the trial court's judgment and invalidation of the charter amendment because the amendment in this case exceeds the limits of authority provided under article VI, section 18(c). We readily disagree. This case is hardly analogous to Missouri Bankers and American Eagle Waste Industries because Missouri has no statute on red-light cameras. \n \nIn Missouri Bankers, our legislature had enacted section 443,454 RSMo. (Supp. 2013) expressly prohibiting local municipalities from enforcing ordinances affecting the enforcement and servicing of real estate loans secured by a mortgage, deed of trust, or other security instrument. 448 S.W.3d at 269. Our Supreme Court determined that the legislature's enactment of section 443,454 RSMo. (Supp. 2013) supported the conclusion that the St. Louis County ordinance at issue addressed a question of state interest rather than a matter of distinctly local concern. Id. at 273. Thus, the Court concluded, St. Louis County was not authorized to legislate in this area pursuant to its delegated police power. Id. \n \nIn American Eagle Waste Industries, a group of private trash collectors claimed St. Louis County improperly commenced waste collection throughout the county without providing notice to the private collectors as required by section 260,247 RSMo. (Supp. 2013). 272 S.W.3d at 338. This Court held that the statutory section at issue was a general statute of statewide public policy, and thus, St. Louis County could not exercise its constitutional legislative authority to override it. Id. at 343-44. In contrast to Missouri Bankers and American Eagle Waste Industries, no Missouri statute establishes a statewide public policy regarding red-light cameras. \n \nThe Cities contend that a statewide policy exists via the three statutory sections discussed earlier. They argue that statewide policy allows each individual city to determine whether it will use red-light cameras because each city has exclusive control over its streets and regulation of traffic on its streets. As we have already discussed, sections 304,120 RSMo. (Supp. 2013), 82.190, and 88.670 do not grant municipalities exclusive control over enforcement mechanisms for traffic regulation. But even if we were to accept the Cities' contention, a policy of leaving the use of red-light cameras to each individual municipality would impede rather than advance the promotion of a uniform statewide policy. 3 If each city could fashion its own use of red-light cameras, the unwary driver might confront a patchwork of diverse red-light camera practices. St. Charles County is a suburban county where a driver can easily pass from one city to another to another in relatively short succession. A driver passing from city to city would never know what he or she might confront without researching multiple municipal red-light camera ordinances. To this end, the voters of St. Charles County have a broader interest in protecting the welfare of the traveling public than do the legislative bodies of the individual municipalities within the County. \n \nThe Cities acknowledge that all of the red-light camera cases adjudicated in Missouri's appellate courts to date have arisen in response to city ordinances in highly populated urban and suburban areas. \u201cLittle purpose would be served in authorizing the adoption of charters of local self-government in the more populous counties if such counties could not adopt reasonable means and methods of carrying out their governmental functions in such a manner as to meet the peculiar needs of such counties.\u201d Missouri Bankers, 448 S.W.3d at 273 (quoting Hellman v. St. Louis County, 302 S.W.2d 911,916 (Mo. 1957)) (emphasis in Missouri Bankers). A countywide ordinance on the use of red-light cameras provides uniformity and protects the traveling public from a multiplicity of ordinances that may vary from city to city. \n \nUltimately, statewide policy consists of more than statutes. \u201cThe public policy of a state must be determined by its Constitution, laws, and judicial decisions.\u201d State ex rel. Equal. Sav. & Bldg. Ass'n v. Brown, 68 S.W.2d 55, 59 (Mo. banc 1934). Thus, we must consider them all. Article VI, section 18(c) of the Missouri Constitution then, which provides for the county's participation in the government of other local units, forms part of state policy. Article VI, section 18(c) authorizes a charter county such as St. Charles County to formulate its own countywide policy\u2014within municipal boundaries as well as in unincorporated areas of the county\u2014unless statewide policy provides otherwise. In the case of red-light cameras, as we have explained, no statewide policy exists. Therefore, under the circumstances present in this case, the authority granted St. Charles County as a charter county pursuant to article VI, section 18(c) prevails because no statewide policy exists on the use of red-light cameras. \n \nWe shall now consider whether the County followed the requirements of section 18(c). \u201cThe second paragraph of section 18(c) requires a charter amendment when the County seeks to exercise countywide legislative power.\u201d Chesterfield Fire Protection Dist., 645 S.W.2d at 371. The County faithfully met this requirement. The second paragraph of section 18(c) also requires that the county charter clearly define the extent to which the County will exercise a service or function once provided by a municipality or political subdivision. Id. at 372. When the function or service has countywide effect, within as well as outside municipalities, the charter provision authorizing the County's performance of this service or function must set out \u201cthe limits within which the municipalities may exercise the same power collaterally and coextensively.\u201d MO. CONST. art. VI, sec. 18(c); Chester field Fire Protection Dist., 645 S.W.2d at 372. Here, the County has assumed the exclusive exercise of power in this area by prohibiting the use of red-light cameras throughout the County. The charter amendment states that \u201cred light cameras or similar photograph devices or automated traffic enforcement systems may not be used in enforcing traffic regulations adopted by St. Charles County or by any municipality within St. Charles County , . . and no such municipality may exercise the legislative power to use such cameras or devices or systems. \u201c (Emphasis added). \n \nThe Cities also contend that the County exceeded its own authority in the county charter by adopting the amendment. The premise of this contention makes no sense. A charter amendment amends the charter. And the county charter provides that it could indeed be amended. 4 We fail then to understand how the current charter limits its amendment. One might as well argue that all change is permissible as long as it seeks no change from the present. The County was seeking additional authority from its citizens, which was granted. It did not seek this new authority based on the authority it already had under its then-current charter. It sought this new authority from its citizens by seeking the charter's amendment. \n \nThe Cities first cite County Charter section 1.601 that \u201c[n]othing herein contained shall be construed so as to give to the County of St. Charles any rights or powers over or pertaining to , . . [the municipalities] that are not granted by law to First Class Charter Counties.\u201c (Emphasis added). We reiterate that article VI, section 18(c) specifically grants to St. Charles County the necessary power within incorporated municipalities. \n \nThe Cities next cite County Charter section 2.514, which provides: \n \nThe County Council shall have the power, pursuant to and in conformity with applicable law, and without limiting the generality of the powers vested in the County by this Charter, to: \n \n*** \n \n2.514\u2024 [W]ithin the incorporated areas of the County, license and tax all businesses, occupations, professions, vocations, activities, or things whatsoever set forth and enumerated by the Constitution or by applicable law, and to regulate those businesses, occupations, professions, vocations, activities, or things with the consent of the Governing Body of the affected [municipality]. Nothing in this Charter shall preempt the power of any local government to license, tax, and regulate in accordance with the Constitution and applicable law[.] \n \n(Emphasis added). On its face, this charter provision pertains to trade and commerce. The section has nothing to do with regulation of traffic-enforcement mechanisms. In addition, a city is not exercising a power \u201cin accordance with the Constitution and applicable law\u201d when the County has exercised its power under article VI, section 18(c) to prohibit a municipality from acting. \n \nFinally, the Cities invoke unnamed \u201cnumerous provisions\u201d of the county charter that purportedly conflict with the amendment. The Cities do not even identify the charter provisions they maintain conflict with the amendment, much less develop any supporting argument, and so abandon their contention as to these \u201cnumerous provisions.\u201d \n \nMoreover, \u201c[a] charter is the county's fundamental, organic law.\u201d Barber v. Jackson County Ethics Comm'n, 935 S.W.2d 62, 67 (Mo. App. W.D. 1996). A charter amendment operates to change the County's fundamental, organic law. Once changed, the amendments supersede contradictory provisions, and any differences between older provisions of the charter and later amendments are rendered immaterial. \n \nThe St. Charles County charter amendment prohibiting the use of red-light cameras and similar photograph devices fits well within the power granted the County by article VI, section 18(c) of the Missouri Constitution. We conclude that the charter amendment is constitutional and does not violate the County's own charter. \n \nThe Charter Amendment and the Judiciary \n \nThe Cities contend that the amendment impermissibly interferes with the judiciary's constitutionally assigned power to determine questions of law, including to determine what evidence is admissible. They argue that the charter amendment creates a rule of \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d that a violation did or did not occur. The Cities further argue that it creates an \u201cunreasonable, unnatural and extraordinary inference,\u201d and that a defendant would be precluded from introducing exculpatory photographic or video evidence. 5 \n \nArticle II, section 1 of the Missouri Constitution provides for the distribution of powers among three departments of government. \n \nThe powers of government shall be divided into three distinct departments\u2014the legislative, executive and judicial\u2014each of which shall be confided to a separate magistracy, and no person, or collection of persons, charged with the exercise of powers properly belonging to one of those departments, shall exercise any power properly belonging to either of the others, except in the instances in this constitution expressly directed or permitted. \n \nWe reject the Cities' arguments. The charter amendment does not purport to dictate how the courts are to determine any question of law. The amendment does not seek to tell courts what evidence they can or cannot consider. The amendment does not attempt to create any inferences. Nor does it prohibit defendants from introducing exculpatory evidence. The charter amendment simply creates a uniform county-wide policy prohibiting the use of particular enforcement mechanisms, namely red-light cameras, for traffic regulation at intersections controlled by red traffic lights. The charter amendment does not invade the province of the judiciary. \n \nThe Validity of the Election \n \nThe Cities challenge the election in which the voters approved the amendment. They again maintain that the County lacked constitutional authority under article VI, section 18(c) to adopt the amendment, and that the proposition appearing on the ballot contained irregularities of sufficient magnitude to cast doubt on the election's validity. \n \nSt. Charles County presented the following proposition to the county's voters in the November 2014 election: \n \nPROPOSITION RED LIGHT CAMERA \n \nShall the St. Charles County Charter be amended to add a Section 10.130 reading: \n \n\u201c10.130. Automated Traffic Enforcement Systems. Notwithstanding any other provision of this St. Charles County Charter, red light cameras or similar photograph devices or automated traffic enforcement systems may not be used in enforcing traffic regulations adopted by St. Charles County or by any municipality within St. Charles County that prohibit drivers from entering intersections when controlled by red traffic lights, and no such municipality may exercise the legislative power to use such cameras or devices or systems. This prohibition is the only limit imposed by this Charter upon the County or any municipality within it in performing their functions of regulating traffic and imposes no additional costs that need to be financed.\u201d? \n \nChapter 115 allows registered voters to contest \u201c[t]he result of any election on any question\u201d after an election has been held. Section 115,553.2. Chapter 115 provides guidelines for post-election challenges to election results based on \u201cirregularities\u201d that occur during elections. See, e.g., section 115,593; Dotson v. Kander, 464 S.W.3d 190, 194 (Mo. banc 2015). Section 115,593 provides in pertinent part: \n \nIf the court or legislative body trying a contested election determines there were irregularities of sufficient magnitude to cast doubt on the validity of the initial election, it may order a new election for the contested office or on the contested question. \n \nThis chapter seeks to ensure that election results are valid. Dotson, 464 S.W.3d at 194. Chapter 115 does not define \u201cirregularities,\u201d but courts have considered the violation of election statutes to be an irregularity that an election contest can address. Id. \n \nThe Cities first argue that the charter amendment itself is invalid and lacks constitutional authorization. We have already concluded that the charter amendment is constitutional and does not violate the County's own charter. \n \nSecond, the Cities maintain that the ballot proposition failed to conform to the requirement of article VI, section 18(c) that the proposition submitted to voters \u201ccontain a clear definition of the power, function or service to be performed and the method by which it will be financed.\u201d To the contrary, the charter amendment is a prohibition, and defines precisely what is prohibited: the use of \u201cred light cameras or similar photograph devices or automated traffic enforcement systems \u2024 in enforcing traffic regulations adopted by St. Charles County or by any municipality within St. Charles County that prohibit drivers from entering intersections when controlled by red traffic lights \u2024\u201d The ballot proposition further clarifies that \u201c[t]his prohibition is the only limit imposed by this Charter upon the County or any municipality within it in performing their functions of regulating traffic \u2024\u201d And contrary to the Cities' argument, the ballot language specifically addresses the method by which the County's action will be financed by stating that there are no costs to finance: \u201cThis prohibition \u2024 imposes no additional costs that need to be financed.\u201d \n \nNext, the Cities turn to section 115,593 to urge invalidation of the election. They argue that the title of the proposition\u2014\u201cProposition Red Light Camera\u201d\u2014was misleading. Here, the entire proposed charter amendment consisting of 112 words appeared on the ballot for the County's voters. The language was plain and straightforward. The language was not vague or confusing. We fail to see how the ballot title or proposition language could have confused or misled any voter. \n \nFinally, the Cities contend in a conclusory manner that the proposition included the implicit amendment or repeal of four other charter sections without identifying this impact, thus misleading the voters. We have already addressed the Cities' contention that the amendment affected sections 1.601 and 2.514 of the county charter. The Cities further cite charter sections 2.529 and 10.501 as being affected, but the Cities do not set forth the language of these provisions, and they offer no supporting argument. The Cities thus abandon this assertion. \n \nThe Cities argue that these purported defects and irregularities are of a sufficient magnitude to cast doubt on the validity of the election, thus compelling invalidation of the election and an order for a new one. We reject their contentions. Furthermore, no evidence suggests that the outcome of the election was tainted. The trial court did not err in rejecting the Cities' election challenge. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe charter amendment constitutes a valid exercise of the County's broad power to regulate municipal services and functions under Missouri Constitution article VI, section 18(c), and the amendment does not contravene any statewide policy concerning red-light cameras. Nor does the amendment violate the county charter itself. The amendment does not invade the province of the judiciary as it does not restrict the evidence that courts can consider. Finally, the proposition appearing on the ballot contained no irregularities of sufficient magnitude to cast doubt on the validity of the election. \n \nConsequently, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the County, and in denying the Cities' opposing motion for summary judgment. We affirm the trial court's judgment. \n \nAPPENDIX \n \nAs of this writing, one bill is pending in the Missouri legislature to submit to voters a measure prohibiting the use of automated traffic-enforcement systems, and requiring political subdivisions to complete or terminate automated traffic-enforcement contracts within one year.

HM ACQUISITION, LLC and HCA, INC., Appellants. \n WD 79340      Decided: January 17, 2017  Before Division IV: Mark D. Pfeiffer, Chief Judge, and Thomas H. Newton and Cynthia L. Martin, Judges \nHM Acquisition, LLC (\u201cHM Acquisition\u201d) and HCA, Inc. (\u201cHCA\u201d) appeal from the judgment entered by the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri (\u201ctrial court\u201d), after a bench trial, in favor of Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City (\u201cFoundation\u201d) on the Foundation's petition for declaratory judgment, accounting, and specific performance. The trial court's judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and modified. \n \nFactual and Procedural Background \n \nHealth Midwest, a Missouri nonprofit public benefit corporation, owned a number of hospitals in the greater Kansas City metropolitan area. In 2002, because of Health Midwest's lack of access to capital necessary to maintain, expand, and renovate the facilities it owned, its board decided to explore the sale of its hospitals and other assets. \n \nHealth Midwest contacted HCA, a publicly-traded corporation with headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee, and the largest for-profit health care provider hospital chain in the nation, and solicited it to buy the assets of Health Midwest. This led to negotiations between the parties that were ultimately successful. Later that year, HCA formed HM Acquisition, a Missouri limited liability company, for the purpose of acquiring certain assets and liabilities of Health Midwest. \n \nHealth Midwest and HM Acquisition executed an Asset Purchase Agreement (\u201cAPA\u201d) on November 22, 2002. Under the terms of the APA, HCA agreed to serve as guarantor of HM Acquisition's performance and obligations. Under Section 2.1 of the APA, Health Midwest agreed to sell to HM Acquisition substantially all of its tangible and intangible assets, principally nine hospitals in the Kansas City metropolitan area, for the purchase price of $1.125 billion dollars. Under Article 5 of the APA, HM Acquisition agreed to certain post-closing operating covenants. Section 5.1 states: \n \n5.1 Capital Improvements.[1] Within two (2) years following the Closing Date, [HM Acquisition] will either spend or commit to spend at least Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000) in capital expenditures. In each of the three (3) years subsequent to the two-year period following the Closing Date, [HM Acquisition] will either spend or commit to spend at least Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) in capital expenditures. Any amounts spent in any period that are in excess of the required amount for such period will be credited against amounts required to be spent or committed to be spent in subsequent periods. Moreover, any Permitted Capital Expenditures and any capital expenditures made by Seller or System Entities which are approved by [HM Acquisition] shall be credited against [HM Acquisition's] obligations under this Section 5.1. The amount of capitalized expenditures made under this Section 5.1 will be determined in accordance with [HM Acquisition's] then applicable accounting policies and procedures. The construction of new facilities by [HM Acquisition] will not materially detract from the required maintenance and necessary improvement of existing Facilities. \n \nHM Acquisition also agreed in Section 5.14 to provide Health Midwest an annual report \u201csetting forth in reasonable detail how it complied with the operating covenants, including a specific accounting of capital expenditures [HM Acquisition] agree[d] to make in accordance with Section 5.1.\u201d \n \nSection 5.15 spelled out Health Midwest's remedies should HM Acquisition breach or not perform any of the Article 5 operating covenants: \n \nBreach or nonperformance of any operating covenant set forth in this Article 5 will entitle [Health Midwest] to the indemnification rights set forth in Article 13 and/or any and all other remedies at law or equity (including monetary damages suffered by the community as a result of such breach or nonperformance, specific performance, and restraining order, injunction or other equitable relief). In addition, if the annual report shows that, for any applicable period, [HM Acquisition] has not spent or committed to spend dollars on capital expenditures during such period at least equal to the amount [HM Acquisition] agreed to provide in Section 5.1, then [HM Acquisition] will immediately pay such shortfall to [Health Midwest]. Moreover, if [HM Acquisition] has not spent $450,000,000 on capital expenditures (and amounts paid to [Health Midwest] pursuant to this Section 5.15) within a reasonable period of time after the fifth anniversary of the Closing \u2024 , then [HM Acquisition] will immediately pay such shortfall to [Health Midwest]. \n \nPursuant to Section 14.18 of the APA, HCA, as guarantor, \u201cunconditionally and absolutely guarantee[d] the prompt performance and observation of [HM Acquisition] for each and every obligation, covenant[,] and agreement of [HM Acquisition] arising out of, connected with, or related to this [APA] or any ancillary documents hereto[.]\u201d \n \nFour days after the execution of the APA, Health Midwest filed lawsuits against the Attorneys General of Missouri and Kansas, challenging their attempts to exercise authority over the disposition of the proceeds of the sale of Health Midwest's public benefit assets. Section 8.5 of the APA provided that Health Midwest and HM Acquisition would cooperate to secure all necessary government approvals to consummate the transaction anticipated by the APA, including from the Missouri and Kansas Attorneys General. Though the APA obligated Health Midwest to \u201ctake the lead\u201d in any such efforts, Health Midwest was obligated to \u201cinclude [HM Acquisition] in any such discussions.\u201d In the same section of the APA, the parties agreed to \u201cprepare any document or other material which may be required by [the Missouri and Kansas Attorneys General] as a predicate to or result of the transactions contemplated\u201d by the APA. Accordingly, Health Midwest\u2009 2 entered into a Settlement Agreement on July 23, 2003, with the Missouri Attorney General, wherein Health Midwest agreed to create the Foundation, 3 a Missouri nonprofit public benefit corporation, to receive eighty percent of the net proceeds of the sale and eighty percent of the net assets retained by Health Midwest upon its future dissolution. The Settlement Agreement provided that the Missouri Attorney General \u201cspecifically reserve[d] his right \u2024 to monitor HCA's[ 4 ] compliance with its obligations under the APA and to seek to enforce those obligations.\u201d The Settlement Agreement attached as an exhibit an agreement to be later executed (\u201cJoinder Agreement\u201d) wherein foundations created in Missouri and Kansas\u2009 5 to receive shares of the proceeds paid to Health Midwest would become parties to the APA with HM Acquisition's consent. By virtue of the Settlement Agreement, the transactions contemplated in the APA were authorized to proceed. 6 \n \nOn February 19, 2004, the Joinder Agreement anticipated by the Settlement Agreement was executed by representatives of Reach Healthcare, the Foundation, Health Midwest, and HM Acquisition. The Joinder Agreement identified Reach Healthcare and the Foundation as Health Midwest's \u201cTransferees\u201d as contemplated by the APA. In the Joinder Agreement, the \u201cTransferees\u201d agreed \u201cto be bound by the provisions in the [APA] to the same extent as [Health Midwest].\u201d Numbered paragraph 1 of the Joinder Agreement provided that Reach Healthcare and the Foundation each: \n \n(i) agrees to be made a party to the [APA] solely for purposes of assuming the obligations of [Health Midwest] thereunder and (ii) assumes and consents to be bound by all post-closing terms and conditions of the [APA] as [Health Midwest] \u2024 to the same extent as, and jointly and severally obligated with, [Health Midwest] \u2024 ; provided that the foregoing agreement, assumption and consent by [the Foundation] is not intended to, and does not, constitute an assignment of rights of [Health Midwest] under the [APA] pursuant to Section 14.3 of the [APA] and [HM Acquisition] does not hereby consent to any such assignment. \n \nThe parties further agreed that under no circumstances would Health Midwest be liquidated or dissolved until five years after the closing date of the APA. Numbered paragraph 4 of the Joinder Agreement stated: \n \nEach party shall be entitled to specific performance of any of the provisions of this Joinder or the [APA] in addition to any other equitable remedies to which such party may otherwise be entitled as a result of a failure by the other party to comply with its obligations hereunder or thereunder. \n \nOn October 2, 2009, the Foundation filed a four-count petition against HM Acquisition and HCA. 7 In Counts II, III, and IV, the Foundation sought to enforce certain covenants in Article 5 of the APA: for an accounting related to HCA's required reporting and compliance with the APA (Count II); for a declaration regarding HM Acquisition and HCA's compliance with Section 5.1 and 5.14 of the APA (Count III); and to order specific performance of the covenants in the APA (Count IV). The primary dispute related to the interpretation of Section 5.1 of the APA, and whether HCA was entitled to take credit for the construction of new facilities in Independence and Lee's Summit in order to satisfy the $450 million capital expenditure requirements of Section 5.1. \n \nOn January 24, 2013, after two-plus weeks of evidentiary hearings, the trial court issued a ruling denominating 571 paragraphs (and 140 pages) of findings of fact and conclusions of law (\u201cFOF\u201d), in which the trial court concluded that HM Acquisition (as the purchaser under the APA) and HCA (as the guarantor under the APA) (collectively referred to hereafter as \u201cHCA\u201d) had breached the APA in that: (i) HCA was not entitled to take credit for the construction of new facilities in order to satisfy the APA's Section 5.1 requirements, which related only to capital expenditures for \u201cexisting Facilities\u201d purchased by HCA; and (ii) HCA improperly attempted to take credit for \u201ccommitments\u201d to spend claimed to have been made by HCA in alleged compliance with Section 5.1 of the APA. The trial court preliminarily awarded the Foundation a total of $161,908,504, representing the trial court's calculation of the lowest shortfall sum due and owing under the APA; awarded the Foundation attorney's fees and costs; and ordered the parties to participate in a court-supervised accounting with a special master to determine whether the Foundation was owed additional shortfall amounts under Section 5.1 of the APA. \n \nDuring the accounting phase with the special master, additional shortfalls totaling $77,536,321 were stipulated to exist. 8 On December 9, 2015, the trial court issued its Judgment, awarding the Foundation $239,444,825 (total shortfall amount), plus $167,105,206 (prejudgment interest), plus $27,175,562 in attorney's fees, costs, and prejudgment interest on the fees and costs, for a total judgment of $433,725,593, with interest continuing to accrue thereon at nine percent per annum, compounded annually, from and after November 19, 2015. \n \nHCA timely appealed. \n \nStandard of Review \n \nIn a bench-tried case, the judgment of the trial court will be sustained by the appellate court \u201cunless there is no substantial evidence to support it, unless it is against the weight of the evidence, unless it erroneously declares the law, or unless it erroneously applies the law.\u201d Murphy v. Carron, 536 S.W.2d 30, 32 (Mo. banc 1976). We defer to the trial court's determination of the weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses. Brasher v. Craig, 483 S.W.3d 446, 450 (Mo. App. W.D. 2016). The trial court is free to believe some, all, or none of the testimony of any witness. Id. We review the evidence in a bench-tried case \u201cin a light most favorable to the judgment, accept it as true, and disregard any contradictory evidence.\u201d Id. (internal quotation omitted). In reviewing a court-tried case, \u201c[t]he appellate court is primarily concerned with the correctness of the trial court's result, not the route taken by the trial court to reach that result.\u201d Business Men's Assurance Co. of Am. v. Graham, 984 S.W.2d 501, 506 (Mo. banc 1999). \u201cThus, the judgment will be affirmed if cognizable under any theory, regardless of whether the reasons advanced by the trial court are wrong or not sufficient.\u201d Id. \n \nAnalysis \n \nPoint I \u2013 Standing \n \nIn HCA's first point, it asserts that the Foundation lacked standing to bring this suit. Standing is a question of law that we review de novo. Schweich v. Nixon, 408 S.W.3d 769, 773 (Mo. banc 2013). To have standing, a plaintiff must have a legally protectable interest at stake arising from threatened or actual injury. Id. \u201cA plaintiff has a legally protectable interest if the plaintiff is directly and adversely affected by the action in question \u2024\u201d Byrne & Jones Enters., Inc. v. Monroe City R-1 Sch. Dist., 493 S.W.3d 847, 851 (Mo. banc 2016). \n \nThe gist of HCA's argument is that the Foundation, via the Joinder Agreement, acquired Health Midwest's \u201cobligations\u201d under the APA but not its \u201crights,\u201d and thus had no standing to utilize remedial measures to compel HCA's compliance with Section 5.1 of the APA. \n \nTo address HCA's standing argument, we must necessarily interpret the terms of the Joinder Agreement and APA. Interpretation of a contract is a question of law, which we review de novo. Newco Atlas, Inc. v. Park Range Constr., Inc., 272 S.W.3d 886, 891 (Mo. App. W.D. 2008). \u201cThe cardinal principle of contract interpretation is to ascertain the intention of the parties and to give effect to that intent.\u201d Dunn Indus. Grp., Inc. v. City of Sugar Creek, 112 S.W.3d 421, 428 (Mo. banc 2003). We read the terms of a contract as a whole to determine the intention of the parties, and we give the terms their plain, ordinary, and usual meaning. Id. \u201cAdditionally, each term of a contract is construed to avoid rendering other terms meaningless.\u201d Id. \u201cA construction that attributes a reasonable meaning to all the provisions of the agreement is preferred to one that leaves some of the provisions without function or sense.\u201d Id. \n \nThe APA was the definitive acquisition agreement between the seller, Health Midwest, and the buyer, HCA. Section 14.3 of the APA provides that, subject to any contrary provisions, the APA \u201cinure[s] to the benefit of and [is] binding upon the parties hereto and their respective legal representatives, successors and assigns.\u201d Section 14.3 of the APA further provides that \u201cany transferee of funds of [Health Midwest] \u2024 shall become obligated hereunder in the same manner as [Health Midwest] and shall execute any agreements or other documentation to effect such obligation as [HCA] may reasonably request.\u201d \n \nThe APA anticipated the need to secure various governmental approvals as a condition to closing, and particularly the approvals of the Missouri and Kansas Attorneys General. Section 8.5 obligated the parties to the APA to cooperate to secure any required approvals, and in executing documents required to do so. The Settlement Agreement between Health Midwest and the Missouri Attorney General constituted just such a document, and though not itself signed by HCA, was nonetheless negotiated with HCA's involvement, as found by the Judgment. In keeping with this fact, the Settlement Agreement attached an agreed form of the Joinder Agreement\u2014a document which required HM Acquisition's signature\u2014to evidence the Foundation's right to receive funds otherwise payable to Health Midwest pursuant to the APA and HCA's consent to same, as required by Section 14.3 of the APA. \n \nIn numbered paragraph 1 of the Joinder Agreement, the Foundation: \n \nhereby (i) agrees to be made a party to the [APA] solely for the purposes of assuming the obligations of [Health Midwest] thereunder and (ii) assumes and consents to be bound by all the post-closing terms and conditions of the [APA] \u2024 to the same extent as, and jointly and severally obligated with, [Health Midwest] (including without limitation the obligations set forth in Section 12.6 and Article 13); provided that the foregoing agreement, assumption and consent by [the Foundation] is not intended to, and does not, constitute an assignment of rights of [Health Midwest] under the [APA] \u2024 and [HCA] does not hereby consent to any such assignment. \u2024 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, [the Foundation] agrees to comply with the provisions of Section 14.3 of the Asset Purchase Agreement \u2024 \n \nHCA argues that, pursuant to this provision of the Joinder Agreement, none of Health Midwest's \u201crights\u201d under the APA were assigned to the Foundation by the Joinder Agreement, leaving the Foundation with no remedy for HCA's argued failure to pay Section 5.1 shortfalls. Though the Joinder Agreement does state that none of Health Midwest's \u201crights\u201d under the APA have been assigned, at the same time, the Joinder Agreement incongruently recognizes that the Foundation had acquired the right to receive funds payable to Health Midwest pursuant to the APA. And the Joinder Agreement incongruently affords \u201ceach party\u201d (including the Foundation) the right to enforce by specific performance violated provisions of either the Joinder Agreement or the APA. 9 To conclude, HCA's argument\u2014that the Foundation assumed no enforceable rights by virtue of the Joinder Agreement\u2014would render meaningless HCA's consent to the Foundation's status as the lawful transferee of Health Midwest's right to receive APA proceeds, and would render meaningless the Foundation's expressed right to resort to the Joinder Agreement's \u201cremedies\u201d provision. \n \nThis seeming conflict can be reconciled without rendering any provision of the Joinder Agreement meaningless. See Dunn Indus. Grp., Inc., 112 S.W.3d at 428. HCA consented to the Foundation's lawful status as a \u201ctransferee\u201d of funds otherwise payable to Health Midwest. HCA consented to the Foundation's \u201cassum[ption] \u2024 [of] all post-closing terms and conditions of the [APA]\u201d as if the Foundation were Health Midwest. And HCA agreed that the Foundation could specifically perform any violated provision of the APA impacting its rights as a transferee. The post-closing terms and conditions set forth in Section 5.1 of the APA, and the right described in Section 5.15 to insist on payment of a Section 5.1 shortfall, plainly inured to the benefit of the Foundation as HCA's transferee, and plainly fall within the scope of the Joinder Agreement's remedy provision. Though the Foundation did not \u201cassume,\u201d per se, HCA's rights under the APA, it did not need to, as the Joinder Agreement afforded the Foundation the right to protect its lawful status as the transferee of funds otherwise payable to Health Midwest pursuant to the APA. \n \nIn summary, by executing the Joinder Agreement (which was agreed to and signed by HCA), the Foundation necessarily acquired a consented-to right to receive Health Midwest's proceeds from the APA, necessarily assumed Health Midwest's obligations under the APA, and necessarily acquired the remedial authority to enforce either the Joinder Agreement or the APA to the extent appropriate to preserve its rights. Pursuant to the contractually created remedial authority, the Foundation was entitled to sue HCA to enforce the terms of the APA, including the Post-Closing Operating Covenants, relating to its rights as a transferee of funds otherwise payable to Health Midwest pursuant to the APA\u2014which included the right to enforce the shortfall provisions expressed in Section 5.15 of the APA. The Foundation established its standing by showing that it has a \u201clegally protectable interest at stake in the outcome of the litigation\u201d so as to be \u201cdirectly and adversely affected\u201d by its outcome. Byrne & Jones Enters., Inc. v. Monroe City R-1 Sch. Dist., 493 S.W.3d 847, 851 (Mo. banc 2016) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cIn contract actions, a party has a legally protectable interest at stake if it has a right to enforce the contract as a party thereto \u2024\u201d Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Windsor Grp., Inc., 2 S.W.3d 836, 839 (Mo. App. E.D. 1999). \n \nPoint I is denied. 10 \n \nPoint II \u2013 Necessary Party \n \nIn HCA's second point, it asserts that the trial court erred in denying its motion to join Health Midwest as a necessary party under Rule 52.04(a). HCA contends that Health Midwest is a necessary party because: (i) it was a signatory to the APA; and (ii) if the Foundation has standing, Health Midwest is a co-obligee with a shared right to enforce HCA's Section 5.1 performance. \n \n\u201cWe review the trial court's denial of relief under this Rule [52.04(a)\u2009] only to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence, is against the weight of the evidence, or it erroneously declares or misapplies the law.\u201d Williams Pipeline Co. v. Allison & Alexander, Inc., 80 S.W.3d 829, 837 (Mo. App. W.D. 2002). \n \nHCA asserted as a defense in its answer that the Foundation's petition must be dismissed in whole or in part because the Foundation did not join Health Midwest as a party under Rule 52.04. In its motion to dismiss filed along with its answer, HCA raised the Foundation's failure to join Health Midwest as a necessary party and moved that Health Midwest be joined as a cross-claim defendant. There are two problems with HCA's procedure. First, \u201c[t]he remedy for failure to join a necessary party is by motion to add a necessary party rather than by a motion to dismiss.\u201d Edmunds v. Sigma Chapter of Alpha Kappa, 87 S.W.3d 21, 27 (Mo. App. W.D. 2002). Second, Rule 55.32(g) provides that \u201c[p]arties other than those made parties to the original action may be made parties to a counterclaim or cross-claim in accordance with the provisions of Rules 52.04 and 52.05.\u201d \u201cThis language assumes \u2018a counterclaim or cross-claim\u2019 exists separate from the addition of the new party\u2014it does not provide that non-parties may be added to assert a new cross-claim.\u201d State ex rel. Cohen McNeile & Pappas, P.C. v. Blankenship, 375 S.W.3d 233, 236 (Mo. App. S.D. 2012). Here, HCA claimed Health Midwest was a necessary party but did not file a Rule 52.04 motion. Even if we concluded that HCA's motion to dismiss constituted a motion to add a necessary party, HCA's argument still fails. \n \nRule 52.04(a) requires the joinder of a person if: \n \n(1) in the person's absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person's absence may: (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest. If the person has not been joined, the court shall order that the person be made a party. If the person should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, the person may be made a defendant. \n \n\u201cA necessary person is one who is so vitally interested in the subject matter that a valid judgment cannot be effectively rendered without their presence.\u201d Williams Pipeline Co., 80 S.W.3d at 837. \u201cAn \u2018interest\u2019 exists within the meaning of the Rule where there is a direct claim upon the subject matter of the action that the person will either gain or lose by direct operation of the judgment.\u201d Id. (internal quotation omitted). \n \nHealth Midwest created the Foundation to receive a percentage of the net proceeds of the sale of Health Midwest's assets to HCA pursuant to the terms of the APA. The parties to the transaction anticipated that Health Midwest would be liquidated or dissolved approximately five to six years after the closing date of the APA. In the Joinder Agreement, the Foundation agreed \u201cto be bound by the provisions in the [APA] to the same extent as [Health Midwest].\u201d In numbered paragraph 1 of the Joinder Agreement, the Foundation agreed to be made a \u201ctransferee\u201d party to the APA for the purpose of assuming Health Midwest's obligations thereunder and assumed and consented to be bound by all post-closing terms and conditions of the APA jointly and severally with Health Midwest. Numbered paragraph 4 of the Joinder Agreement entitled each party \u201cto specific performance of any of the provisions of this Joinder or the [APA] in addition to any other equitable remedies to which such party may otherwise be entitled as a result of a failure by the other party to comply with its obligations hereunder or thereunder,\u201d including the obligations assumed by HCA under the Post-Closing Operating Covenants. \n \n\u201cIn determining which parties are required to be before the court, consideration is given \u2024 to the nature of relief requested and the interests to be adjudicated.\u201d Dolphin Capital Corp. v. Schroeder, 247 S.W.3d 93, 97 (Mo. App. W.D. 2008) (internal quotation omitted). In Counts II, III, and IV of the Foundation's petition against HCA, the Foundation sought to enforce certain covenants in Article 5 of the APA and requested an accounting related to HCA's required reporting and compliance with the APA (Count II), a declaration regarding HCA's compliance with Section 5.1 and 5.14 of the APA (Count III), and specific performance of HCA's covenants in the APA (Count IV). \n \nHCA contends that Health Midwest must be joined as a necessary party because it is a signatory to and co-obligee under the APA. We disagree. The Foundation petitioned for equitable relief. The rule that an action upon a joint contract cannot be maintained by one joint obligee without the joinder of co-obligees has long been recognized in Missouri as applicable only in actions at law. Priest v. Oehler, 41 S.W.2d 783, 788 (Mo. 1931). See also State ex rel. Massman Constr. Co. v. Shain, 130 S.W.2d 491, 497 (Mo. 1939); Skidmore v. Back, 512 S.W.2d 223, 235 (Mo. App. 1974) (\u201c[O]ur Supreme Court has held [in Priest] that the proposition urged by the defendant, that one joint obligee must join with other joint obligees in suing upon a joint obligation, is inapposite to suits of an equitable nature.\u201d). \n \nThe interests of the Foundation and Health Midwest in enforcing HCA's obligations under the APA are similar, and complete relief has been accorded among the parties, even in Health Midwest's absence. In Health Midwest's \u201cstraw man\u201d role as a conduit of the proceeds to the Foundation, Health Midwest neither gained nor lost by direct operation of the trial court's judgment. Health Midwest's ability to protect its interests under the APA have not been impeded or impaired by its absence from the action. Further, there is no \u201csubstantial risk\u201d that HCA would be exposed to double or inconsistent obligations resulting from Health Midwest's absence as a party. \n \nIn conclusion, Health Midwest was not so vitally interested in the subject matter of the controversy that a valid judgment adjudicating HCA's obligations under the APA could not be effectively rendered without its presence as a party. The trial court did not err in determining that HCA was not a necessary party to this action. 11 \n \nPoint II is denied. 12 \n \nPoints III, IV, and VI \u2013 Contract Interpretation \n \nHCA's Points III, IV, and VI require us to interpret Sections 5.1, 5.14, and 5.15 of the APA to determine whether, in addition to payment of the purchase price, HCA is contractually obligated to pay a shortfall because it failed to \u201cspend or commit to spend\u201d a minimum of $450 million in capital expenditures in the time and manner required. \n \nPoint III \n \nIn HCA's third point, it asserts that the trial court erred in failing to enter judgment for HCA on the Foundation's claim for breach of Section 5.1 of the APA because the term \u201ccapital expenditures\u201d in Section 5.1 of the APA is unambiguous, and includes capital expenditures for new construction, not just capital expenditures to improve the purchased hospitals. 13 In contrast to HCA's argued position on appeal, the trial court found Section 5.1 of the APA to be ambiguous, and the court resolved that ambiguity in favor of limiting creditable capital expenditures to those on existing Facilities acquired pursuant to the APA. As a result, HCA was not afforded credit against its Section 5.1 capital expenditure obligations for amounts spent or committed to be spent on building a new hospital in Lee's Summit and a new hospital in Independence. 14 \n \nThe interpretation of a contract is a question of law that we review de novo. Belton Chopper 58, LLC v. N. Cass Dev., LLC, 496 S.W.3d 529, 532 (Mo. App. W.D. 2016). \u201cWhen we conduct a de novo review, the judgment may be affirmed on an entirely different basis than that presented to the trial court and can be affirmed on any theory that is supported by the record.\u201d Id. (internal quotation omitted). The cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to ascertain the intention of the parties and to give effect to that intention. West v. Sharp Bonding Agency, Inc., 327 S.W.3d 7, 15-16 (Mo. App. W.D. 2010). \u201cAs with all questions of contract interpretation, we first attempt to ascertain the intent of the parties by looking at the words of the contract and giving those words their plain, ordinary, and usual meaning.\u201d Belton Price Chopper 58, LLC, 496 S.W.3d at 532 (internal quotation omitted). \u201cWe determine this intent based upon the contract language alone unless its terms are ambiguous.\u201d Id. \n \n\u201c[A]mbiguity arises only where the terms are reasonably open to more than one meaning, or the meaning of the language used is uncertain.\u201d Woods of Somerset, LLC v. Developers Sur. & Indem. Co., 422 S.W.3d 330, 335 (Mo. App. W.D. 2013) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cAmbiguity does not arise merely because the parties disagree over the meaning of a provision, and courts may not create ambiguity by distorting contractual language that may otherwise be reasonably interpreted.\u201d Id. Where the contract language is ambiguous, a question of fact arises, and the parties' intent must be established by extrinsic or parol evidence. West, 327 S.W.3d at 15. \n \nHCA argues that the trial court erred in failing to grant it judgment on the Foundation's claim for breach of Section 5.1 of the APA because the term \u201ccapital expenditures\u201d in Section 5.1 is unambiguous and includes new construction. We agree that the term \u201ccapital expenditures\u201d is unambiguous and includes new construction. We do not agree, however, that as a result, the trial court erred in failing to grant judgment in HCA's favor on the Foundation's claim for breach of Section 5.1. \n \nThe Post-Closing Operating Covenant in Section 5.1 of the APA provides: \n \nCapital Improvements. Within two (2) years following the Closing Date, [HCA] will either spend or commit to spend at least Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000) in capital expenditures. In each of the three (3) years subsequent to the two-year period following the Closing Date, Buyer will either spend or commit to spend at least Fifty Million dollars ($50,000,000) in capital expenditures. Any amounts spent in any period that are in excess of the required amount for such period will be credited against amounts required to be spent or committed to be spent in subsequent periods. Moreover, any Permitted Capital Expenditures and any capital expenditures made by [Health Midwest] or System Entities which are approved by [HCA] shall be credited against [HCA's] obligations under this Section 5.1. The amount of capitalized expenditures made under this Section 5.1 will be determined in accordance with [HCA's] then applicable accounting policies and procedures. The construction of new facilities by [HCA] will not materially detract from the required maintenance and necessary improvement of existing Facilities. \n \nThough the APA does not expressly define \u201ccapital expenditures,\u201d it effectively does so by directing that \u201c[t]he amount of capital expenditures made under this Section 5.1 will be determined in accordance with [HCA's] then applicable accounting policies and procedures.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This provision in Section 5.1 of the APA was recognized by the trial court, which found that any expenditure for which HCA sought to take credit toward its obligation to spend or commit to spend as required by Section 5.1 \u201cneeded to be capitalized and made in accordance with HCA's \u2018then applicable accounting policies and procedures.\u2019\u2009\u201d (FOF ¶ 301) The trial court also found that the effect of this provision was to require expenditures claimed to be capital in nature to conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). (FOF ¶ 330) Neither of these findings is challenged on appeal. \n \nPursuant to GAAP, the term \u201ccapital expenditures\u201d has a settled and accepted meaning insofar as it includes costs of new construction. \u201c\u2009\u2018It has long been recognized, as a general matter, that costs incurred in the acquisition \u2024 of a capital asset are to be treated as capital expenditures.\u2019 This principle has obvious application to the acquisition of a capital asset by purchase, but it has been applied, as well, to the costs incurred in a taxpayer's construction of capital facilities.\u201d Comm'r of Internal Revenue v. Idaho Power Co., 418 U.S. 1, 12, 94 S. Ct. 2757, 41 L. Ed. 2d 535 (1974) (quoting Woodward v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue, 397 U.S. 572, 575, 90 S. Ct. 1302, 25 L. Ed. 2d 577 (1970)) (other citations omitted). In fact, applicable Internal Revenue Code regulations addressing capital expenditures \u201cinclude the \u2018cost of acquisition, construction, or erection of buildings.\u2019\u2009\u201d Id. at 16 (quoting Treas. Reg. § 1.263(a)-2(a)). \n \nIn fact, the Foundation does not contest that the phrase \u201ccapital expenditures\u201d has a common and accepted meaning. The Foundation conceded in its pleadings that \u201cmoney spent on the construction of new hospitals can be properly characterized as \u2018capital expenditures'\u2009\u201d; that \u201cthere is no dispute that the APA recognizes that HCA, at the time it entered into the APA, was contemplating building new facilities within the Kansas City area\u201d; and that \u201c[i]n the present case \u2024 the parties agree on the meaning of \u2018capital expenditures.\u2019\u2009\u201d (L.F. at 2612) The Foundation reiterated during oral argument that it does not dispute that the term \u201ccapital expenditures\u201d has a settled meaning which includes new construction. \n \nBecause the term \u201ccapital expenditures\u201d possesses a commonly understood meaning, which includes within its ambit capital improvements to existing Facilities and the cost to construct new facilities, the term is unambiguous. Despite this conceded point, the Foundation argued, and the trial court agreed, that Section 5.1 is ambiguous because it was not clear which capital expenditures should be eligible for credit against HCA's $450 million capital expenditure obligation. We disagree. \n \nSection 5.1 unambiguously provides that \u201c[t]he amount of capitalized expenditures made under this Section 5.1 will be determined in accordance with [HCA's] then applicable accounting policies and procedures.\u201d Section 5.1 thus directs in plain and simple terms which capital expenditures are to be credited against HCA's $450 million capital expenditure obligation. As we have already explained, the trial court found that Section 5.1's reference to HCA's \u201cthen applicable accounting policies and procedures\u201d necessarily referred to GAAP. Thus, substituting the commonly understood meaning of the term \u201ccapital expenditures,\u201d and this finding, accordingly, Section 5.1 plainly directed that \u201c[t]he amount of [expenditures on existing Facilities or new construction] under this Section 5.1 will be determined in accordance with [GAAP].\u201d There is no ambiguity in this directive. HCA was to have been credited with capital expenditures properly characterized as such pursuant to GAAP. \n \nThe Foundation nonetheless argues that, read as a whole, the APA reflects an intent to limit the capital expenditures for which HCA should receive credit to expenditures on existing Facilities. Though it is true that many provisions of the APA refer to the existing Facilities, no provision of the APA is rendered meaningless or ambiguous if Section 5.1 is given its plain and unambiguous meaning. In contrast, ambiguity is created only when Section 5.1 is not afforded its plain and unambiguous meaning. We do not resort to rules of construction to create an ambiguity where none exists. Dunn Indus. Grp., Inc. v. City of Sugar Creek, 112 S.W.3d 421, 429 (Mo. banc 2003). \n \nMoreover, the Foundation's argument ignores its concession that the APA contemplated HCA's possible construction of new facilities. Nowhere is that point made clearer, in fact, than in Section 5.1 itself. The last sentence of Section 5.1 provides that \u201cthe construction of new facilities by [HCA] will not materially detract from the required maintenance and necessary improvement of existing Facilities.\u201d It is not a coincidence that this sentence refers to new construction and improvements to existing Facilities, both agreed-upon components of the settled meaning of the term \u201ccapital expenditure.\u201d Plainly read, the last sentence of Section 5.1 recognizes that even though HCA is contractually entitled to receive credit toward its Section 5.1 capital expenditure obligation for new construction and improvements to existing Facilities, that right is tempered by HCA's obligation to insure that new construction expenditures do not materially detract from necessary improvements to existing Facilities. 15 \n \nIn summary, Section 5.1 is unambiguous. Section 5.1 unambiguously permitted HCA to credit amounts \u201cspent or committed to be spent\u201d on the construction of Lee's Summit Hospital and Centerpoint Hospital against its $450 million capital expenditure obligation. In this respect, Point III is granted. \n \nHowever, our determination does not lead automatically to the conclusion that the trial court erred in failing to enter judgment in HCA's favor on the Foundation's claim for breach of Section 5.1 of the APA. The trial court found that Section 5.1 of the APA created four independent, temporal covenants, 16 the breach of any one of which supported a claim for breach of contract. This subject is addressed in our discussion of Point VIII on appeal, infra. And the trial court found that HCA improperly claimed \u201ccommitments to spend\u201d in calculating its compliance with the temporal covenants set forth in Section 5.1, a subject we address in our discussion of Point VI on appeal, infra. \n \nPoint IV \n \nIn Point IV, HCA argues that if Section 5.1 is deemed ambiguous, the trial court's interpretation is against the weight of the evidence because the weight of the evidence (albeit extrinsic) shows that the parties intended the term \u201ccapital expenditures\u201d to include new construction. Point IV is rendered moot by our resolution of Point III on appeal and need not be further discussed. \n \nPoint VI \n \nIn HCA's sixth point, it asserts that the trial court erred in failing to enter judgment in its favor on the Foundation's claim for breach of Section 5.1 of the APA because the Annual Reports HCA provided Health Midwest as required by Section 5.14 of the APA included representations that HCA would build new medical facilities that were sufficient to constitute \u201ccommitments to spend\u201d pursuant to Section 5.1. The essence of HCA's argument is that by expressing the intent to make capital expenditures in the future on a required Annual Report, HCA made a Section 5.1 \u201ccommitment to spend\u201d that should be credited against its $450 million capital expenditure obligation. The trial court rejected this argument, finding that Section 5.1 requires any expenditure that can be counted toward Section 5.1's capital expenditure obligation must satisfy GAAP, and that the mere inclusion in an Annual Report of a stated intent to spend money in the future did not constitute a \u201ccommitment to spend\u201d pursuant to GAAP. The trial court did not err in reaching this conclusion. \n \nOnce again, the plain and unambiguous language of Section 5.1 of the APA controls. As noted, Section 5.1 provides that \u201c[t]he amount of capitalized expenditures made under this Section 5.1 will be determined in accordance with [HCA's] then applicable accounting policies and procedures.\u201d (Emphasis added.) And as noted, the trial court found that HCA's then applicable accounting policies and procedures necessarily referred to GAAP. HCA advances no argument on appeal to explain how the mere inclusion of a planned future expenditure on an Annual Report required by the APA constitutes a \u201ccommitment to spend\u201d in accordance with GAAP. \n \nThe plain language of Section 5.14 further undercuts HCA's contention. In order to establish compliance with the four temporal covenants set forth in Section 5.1, Section 5.14 required HCA to submit each year to Health Midwest a report \u201csetting forth in reasonable detail how it complied with the operating covenants, including a specific accounting of capital expenditures [HCA] agrees to make in accordance with Section 5.1.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 5.14 thus cross-references Section 5.1, where \u201ccommit to spend\u201d is necessarily calculated based on HCA's then applicable accounting policies and procedures: GAAP. In this context, then, the trial court correctly concluded that HCA's bare recitation in its Annual Reports about a lump sum it intended to spend on \u201cnew hospitals\u201d at an unspecified point in the future was insufficient to constitute the \u201cspecific accounting of capital expenditures [HCA] agrees to make\u201d required by Section 5.14. \n \nPoint VI is denied. \n \nPoint V \u2013 Extrinsic Evidence Application of Law \n \nIn HCA's fifth point, it asserts that the trial court erred in failing to enter judgment for HCA because it misapplied the law of the extrinsic evidence as it related to the trial court's interpretation of a purported ambiguity in Section 5.1 of the APA. \n \nGiven our ruling in Point III that the APA is unambiguous, however, we need not resort to a review of extrinsic or parol evidence; thus, we need not and do not evaluate the trial court's application of law with regard to the trial court's interpretation of such extrinsic or parol evidence. \n \nPoint V is denied. \n \nPoints VII and VIII \u2013 Issue of Harm Caused and/or Penalty Applied \n \nHCA's Points VII and VIII both address the issue of damages; therefore, we will consider them together. In HCA's seventh point, HCA asserts that the trial court erred in entering judgment for the Foundation because the Foundation failed to make a submissible case for breach of contract. In HCA's eighth point, it argues that the trial court erred in awarding the Foundation a \u201cshortfall\u201d of $239 million under Section 5.15 of the APA because the provision is an unenforceable penalty provision. \n \nPoint VII \n \n\u201c[T]he general rule of the law of contracts is well settled that in certain cases a breach of contract may give rise to two remedies.\u201d Magruder v. Pauley, 411 S.W.3d 323, 331 (Mo. App. W.D. 2013) (emphasis added) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cOne is an action at law for damages for the breach; the other is a suit in equity for the specific performance of the contract.\u201d Id. (emphasis added) (internal quotation omitted). HCA mischaracterizes the Foundation's suit as an action at law for damages for breach of contract. The Foundation's suit is an action in equity for specific performance; accordingly, the elements of a cause of action for breach of contract are inapplicable in this case. 17 \n \nPoint VII is denied. \n \nPoint VIII \n \nIn its eighth point, HCA argues that because it is uncontested that HCA actually spent in excess of $450 million in capital expenditures within the five-year period following closing, 18 an award of shortfall damages based on shortfalls incurred in the separate, temporal covenant terms specified by Section 5.1 constitutes an unenforceable penalty. We disagree, as HCA's argument requires us to disregard the plain language of the APA. \n \nSection 5.1 of the APA provides that within two years following the closing date, HCA will either spend or commit to spend at least $300 million in capital expenditures; and in each of the three subsequent years, HCA will either spend or commit to spend at least $50 million in capital expenditures. That totals expenditures or commitments to spend of $450 million over five years, but Section 5.1 expressly requires those expenditures or commitments to spend to be satisfied in four temporal increments. \n \nWe have already explained that Section 5.14 required HCA to provide Health Midwest with an Annual Report detailing \u201chow it complied with the [Article 5] operating covenants, including a specific accounting of capital expenditures [HCA] agrees to make in accordance with Section 5.1.\u201d Section 5.15 of the APA specifies remedies if HCA breaches or fails to perform any of the Article 5 operating covenants, including the payment of shortfalls if HCA does not spend or commit to spend the agreed amount on capital expenditures in the agreed-upon time frames. In pertinent part, Section 5.15 provides: \n \nIn addition, if the [Section 5.14] annual report shows that, for any applicable period, [HCA] has not spent or committed to spend dollars on capital expenditures during such period at least equal to the amount [HCA] agreed to provide in Section 5.1, then [HCA] will immediately pay such shortfall to [Health Midwest]. Moreover, if [HCA] has not spent $450,000,000 on capital expenditures \u2024 within a reasonable period of time after the fifth anniversary of the Closing \u2024 , then [HCA] will immediately pay such shortfall to [Health Midwest]. \n \nThe language in Section 5.15 is not that of a liquidated damages clause. \u201cA liquidated damages provision is a measure of compensation, which, at the time of contracting, the parties agree will represent damages in case of breach.\u201d Frank v. Sandy Rothschild & Assocs., Inc., 4 S.W.3d 602, 605 (Mo. App. E.D. 1999). \u201cWhen such a clause represents a reasonable forecast of the harm caused by the breach and the harm is of a type that is difficult to accurately estimate, courts will enforce it as a liquidated damages provision.\u201d Id. at 606. \u201cHowever, the provision must be formulated to compensate the plaintiff for damages he would suffer as a result of a breach of the contract; otherwise courts will construe it as a penalty clause designed primarily to compel performance and will refuse to enforce it.\u201d Id. \n \nRather, Section 5.15 recognizes that one portion of the consideration offered by HCA for Health Midwest's agreement to enter into the APA was the injection of capital in the temporal time frames required by the APA. In failing to fulfill its temporal obligations, HCA failed to afford Health Midwest a portion of the consideration promised, entitling Health Midwest to recover the shortfall. \n \nHCA's failure to satisfy Section 5.1's temporal expenditure obligations cannot be disregarded merely because HCA ultimately spent all that it was required to spend. HCA could satisfy its Section 5.1 $450 million capital expenditure obligations with \u201ccommitments to spend.\u201d In other words, by the end of the four temporal covenant terms described in Section 5.1, HCA was not required to have actually spent $450 million in capital expenditures. Instead, it is Section 5.15 which imposed the additional obligation on HCA to demonstrate actual capital expenditures of at least $450 million within a reasonable period of time after the four temporal covenant terms described in Section 5.1. Thus, HCA was subject to two distinct capital expenditure obligations: the temporal obligations to spend or to commit to spend described in Section 5.1, and the obligation to actually spend described in Section 5.15. The distinct shortfall recovery rights described in Section 5.15 recognize the independent nature of these contractual obligations. HCA could have satisfied its temporal obligations to spend or commit to spend set forth in Section 5.1, while breaching the obligation to actually spend described in Section 5.15. Conversely, as is the case here, HCA could have satisfied its obligation to actually spend set forth in Section 5.15, while breaching the temporal obligations to spend or commit to spend set forth in Section 5.1. HCA is not relieved of its breach of one contract provision by its performance of another. \n \nNor can it be said that awarding damages for breach of Section 5.1's temporal \u201cspend or commit to spend\u201d provisions is a \u201cpenalty\u201d merely because HCA did not breach the \u201cactually spend\u201d provision described in Section 5.15. HCA's capital expenditure performance was required in specified temporal time frames for reasons that were important to the parties, and that were no doubt influenced by the public impact on the provision of health care; otherwise, the temporal obligations would not have been inserted into the APA. HCA's breach of the temporal performance obligations is best measured by the temporal shortfall\u2014the amount, not coincidentally, that the parties contractually agreed should be the appropriate measure of damages. \n \nThe trial court did not err in granting the Foundation the relief provided by Section 5.15 of the APA for HCA's shortfalls in satisfying the temporal capital expenditure obligations set forth in Section 5.1, although the amount of the shortfall awarded by the trial court must be modified given our determination that HCA should have been afforded credit for amounts spent or properly committed to be spent on new construction, discussed supra. \n \nPoint VIII is denied. \n \nPoint IX \u2013 Prejudgment Interest \n \nIn HCA's ninth point, it asserts that the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest, compounded annually, from the date the Petition was filed because, as of that date, the measure of damages was unclear and disputed, and the amount of damages was neither liquidated nor reasonably ascertainable. \n \nIn the trial court's December 9, 2015 Judgment, it awarded the Foundation the sum of $239,444,825 as the aggregate shortfall amount. Though the trial court's ruling in January 2013 had denied the Foundation's request for prejudgment interest, the trial court reconsidered its ruling and, in its December 2015 judgment, ordered HCA to pay the Foundation prejudgment interest from October 2, 2009 (the date the lawsuit was filed) \u201cat the statutory rate of 9% per annum pursuant to RSMO. § 408.020 and/or § 408.040, compounded annually \u2024 until this Judgment is satisfied in full[.]\u201d Thus, at the time of the judgment in 2015, the trial court awarded prejudgment interest on the shortfall amount in the sum of $167,105,206. With the \u201ccompounding annually\u201d feature in this judgment, the interest on the shortfall would soon exceed the amount of the shortfall. \n \nIn addition, the trial court awarded the Foundation attorney's fees (approximately $21,000,000) and costs (approximately $1,500,000) and ordered that HCA pay prejudgment interest, compounded annually, on the bulk of these fees and costs in the approximate amount of $5,000,000. \n \n\u201cIn equitable actions, the determination of whether to award prejudgment interest is left to the discretion of the trial court.\u201d McDonald v. Ins. Co. of State of Pa., 460 S.W.3d 58, 67 (Mo. App. W.D. 2015) (internal quotation omitted). See also Carpenter v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 250 S.W.3d 697, 704 (Mo. banc 2008); Boyle v. Crimm, 253 S.W.2d 149, 157 (Mo. 1952). When a claimant seeks an equitable remedy, the trial court may be guided by the equitable principles of fairness and justice when determining whether to award prejudgment interest. Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Skyway Aviation, Inc., 828 S.W.2d 888, 892 (Mo. App. W.D. 1992). If the trial court, in its discretion, awards prejudgment interest in an equitable action, the rate of interest should be that in section 408.020. Vogel v. Lake Timberline Prop. Owners Voluntary Ass'n, 741 S.W.2d 869, 872 (Mo. App. E.D. 1987). Prejudgment interest under section 408.020 may be awarded when the measure of damages is clear and when the amount due is liquidated or readily ascertainable. Am. Eagle Waste Indus., LLC v. St. Louis Cty., 379 S.W.3d 813, 835 (Mo. banc 2012). \n \nHere, it simply cannot be reasonably said that the amount due was either liquidated or readily ascertainable at the time the petition was filed. Aside from the fact that the trial court's judgment itself spends over 100 pages explaining why it believed it needed extrinsic evidence to understand the \u201cintent\u201d of Section 5.1 of the APA (which obviously impacts calculation of the shortfall in the judgment), the trial court also considered it necessary to order the appointment of a special master to conduct a court-supervised accounting in order to determine the full extent to which HCA satisfied (or failed to satisfy) its obligations under Section 5.1. The trial court stated that it appointed a special master to conduct the accounting because \u201cthis is clearly a \u2018matter of accounting and of difficult computation of damages,\u2019 as stated in Rule 68.01(b).\u201d (Emphasis added.) \n \nSpecifically, the trial court ordered that the accounting include determinations with regard to HCA's compliance with Section 5.1, including whether the amounts claimed in the Second through the Sixth Annual Reports \u201cfor the existing Facilities were actually spent or properly committed to be spent by HCA in accordance with HCA's then applicable accounting policies and procedures.\u201d The trial court further ordered that the accounting consider: \n \n(1) whether expenditures in the existing Facilities for which HCA could properly take credit in accordance with the APA and this Court's findings were: (a) actually expended, and (b) actually capitalized in accordance with HCA's then applicable accounting policies and procedures; (2) whether and to what extent HCA had actually entered into agreements giving rise to obligations or otherwise entered into actual \u201ccommitments\u201d for items relating to the existing Facilities and identified as \u201ccommitments\u201d in any of the Annual Reports; and (3) whether and to what extent HCA properly accounted for the net book value of Medical Center of Independence, Independence Regional Health Center, Lee's Summit Hospital, and Baptist Lutheran Medical Center, and the equipment and other assets of those facilities upon their closing. \n \n(FOF ¶ 563) \n \nSimply put, we agree with the trial court that there were \u201cdifficult\u201d accounting issues reasonably in dispute necessitating the use of a court-supervised special master. Thus, we conclude that the shortfall amount due under the APA was neither liquidated nor readily ascertainable when the Foundation filed its petition on October 2, 2009, nor as of the 2013 appointment of the special master. The trial court's conclusion to the contrary was an abuse of its discretion; thus, the trial court erred in that portion of the judgment awarding prejudgment interest. \n \nHCA also contends that the trial court erred in awarding compound interest, both in its prejudgment interest award and all sums continuing to be owed under the judgment until the judgment is satisfied in full. Although we need not address HCA's contention as to the prejudgment interest award given our conclusion that the trial court erred in awarding the Foundation prejudgment interest at all, we must review HCA's claim of error as it relates to post-judgment interest. \n \nSection 408.020 governs the rate of interest (nine percent per annum) 19 that a trial court may award but does not specify whether simple or compound interest\u2009 20 shall be applied. \u201cCompound interest generally is not allowable on a judgment.\u201d Wallemann v. Wallemann, 817 S.W.2d 548, 549 (Mo. App. E.D. 1991). There are two exceptions to the general rule that compound interest is not available on judgments in Missouri. Geisner v. Budget Rent A Car of Mo., 999 S.W.2d 265, 268 (Mo. App. E.D. 1999). \u201cFirst, trial courts, sitting as courts of equity, may assess compound interest when justice requires it to serve the cause of equity.\u201d Id. \u201cSecond, compound interest is allowed if the parties consent to it in the contract or agreement in question.\u201d Id. \n \nHere, the parties did not consent to compound interest in the APA. Therefore, the issue is whether justice required compound interest to serve the cause of equity. The Foundation contends that the trial court, as a court of equity, had discretion to award it compound interest. It argues that HCA was the Foundation's fiduciary, and as a result of HCA's failure to abide by its APA obligations, the Foundation lost investment income when HCA retained the compound component of the interest and investment income it realized on the Foundation's principal for more than a decade. \n \n\u201cMissouri courts have upheld equitable awards of compound interest only when there has been a breach of fiduciary duty, such as self-dealing or commingling of funds.\u201d Id. See also Palmer v. Palmer, 805 S.W.2d 326 (Mo. App. W.D. 1991) (partner); Armstrong v. Priest (In re Murdoch), 31 S.W. 942 (Mo. 1895) (assignee for distribution among partnership creditors); Bobb v. Bobb, 4 S.W. 511 (Mo. 1887) (trustee); Pomeroy v. Benton, 77 Mo. 64 (1882) (partner); Camp's Creditors & Distributees v. Camp's Adm'r, 74 Mo. 192 (1881) (administrator); In re Davis, 62 Mo. 450 (1876) (executor); Williams v. Heirs of Petticrew, 62 Mo. 460 (1876) (administrator); and Frost v. Winston, 32 Mo. 489 (1862) (guardian). Those cases are distinguishable from the present case because the Foundation has not alleged that HCA engaged in self-dealing or commingling of funds. Additionally, HCA and the Foundation were parties to a contract with differing interests; therefore, HCA did not have a fiduciary relationship with the Foundation. See Inauen Packaging Equip. Corp. v. Integrated Indus. Servs., Inc., 970 S.W.2d 360, 371 (Mo. App. W.D. 1998) (\u201cIt has long been the rule in our state that the existence of a business relationship does not give rise to a fiduciary relationship, nor a presumption of such a relationship.\u201d (internal quotation omitted)). Accordingly, the equitable exception to the general rule against compound interest does not apply in this case, and the trial court erred in awarding compound interest on the judgment. \n \nPoint IX is granted. \n \nPoint X \u2013 Percentage of Shortfall Award \n \nIn HCA's tenth point, without reference to any legal authority for its position, it asserts that the trial court erred in awarding the Foundation 100% of the alleged \u201cshortfall.\u201d \n \nRule 84.04(e) requires the appellant's brief to contain an argument section that discusses the errors included in the point relied on. \u201cAn argument should show how the principles of law and the facts of the case interact.\u201d Nicol v. Nicol, 491 S.W.3d 266, 270 (Mo. App. W.D. 2016) (internal quotation omitted). HCA's argument consists of one paragraph, to-wit: \n \nThe trial court erred in awarding the Foundation 100% of the alleged \u201cshortfall,\u201d because under the AG Settlement agreement, the Foundation is entitled to only 80% of APA-related proceeds and [Reach Healthcare] is entitled to the rest. See L.F.435 (Foundation identifying itself as \u201cthe party entitled to 80 percent of the monetary proceeds at trial\u201d). [Reach Healthcare] is not a party to this litigation and never assigned its rights to the alleged \u201cshortfall\u201d to the Foundation. \n \nHCA's argument lacks citation to relevant legal authority, fails to compare the facts of the case to any relevant principles of law, lacks any pertinent legal analysis, and is comprised mainly of unsupported conclusions. See id. at 271. An appellant has an obligation to cite appropriate and available precedent if it expects to prevail, and, if no authority is available, it should explain the reason why citations are unavailable. Thummel v. King, 570 S.W.2d 679, 687 (Mo. banc 1978). \u201cMere conclusions and the failure to develop an argument with support from legal authority preserve nothing for review.\u201d Nicol, 491 S.W.3d at 271 (internal quotation omitted). \u201cIf a party does not support contentions with relevant authority or argument beyond conclusory statements, the point is deemed abandoned.\u201d Id. (internal quotation omitted). \n \nBut even if we disregard HCA's Rule 84.04 violation, its point is without substantive merit. The record reveals that the Foundation and Reach Healthcare entered into an Agreement on April 19, 2011, with regard to the Foundation's pending lawsuit against HCA. 21 In that Agreement, Reach Healthcare expressly agreed to: \n \nfully and forever waive, release, and relinquish any and all rights, claims, or interests that it may have or assert in or with regard to any funds that may be obtained by [the Foundation] \u2024 or any other person or entity from HCA, HM Acquisition, LLC or an affiliate of HCA or HM Acquisition, LLC through any judgment in or by settlement of the Lawsuit. \n \nThe Agreement, thus, contradicts the conclusory argument by HCA that the shortfalls awarded by the trial court should be reduced by Reach Healthcare's alleged percentage share of any judgment proceeds. \n \nPoint X is denied. \n \nRule 84.14 Adjustments to the Judgment \n \nBy virtue of our rulings today, the trial court's judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and should be modified accordingly. Rule 84.14 directs us to \u201cgive such judgment as the court ought to give\u201d and, \u201c[u]nless justice otherwise requires,\u201d to \u201cdispose finally of the case.\u201d Accordingly, because we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding credit for capital expenditures for new construction toward the capital expenditure obligations therein set forth, and because we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest and erred in ordering that compound interest accrue on all the amounts awarded in the judgment, in lieu of remanding this matter to the trial court, we modify the judgment pursuant to our authority under Rule 84.14 as follows: \n \n1. We reverse that portion of the Judgment in favor of the Foundation and against HCA (that is, HM Acquisition, LLC and HCA, Inc., jointly and severally) in the amount of $239,444,825, which represented the collective amount of the stipulated shortfalls during the four reporting periods anticipated by Section 5.1.22 HCA is entitled to credit against the stipulated shortfalls for $22,934,418 the trial court found it spent toward new construction of Lee's Summit Hospital during the first covenant period (FOF ¶ 279) and for $12,142,373 the trial court found it committed to spend in accordance with GAAP toward construction of the new hospital in Independence during the first covenant period (FOF ¶ 438, 448). HCA is also entitled to credit for the collective shortfall of $38,625,215 stipulated to for the second, third, and fourth covenant periods, as the trial court found that HCA committed to spend well in excess of that amount to build Lee's Summit Hospital as of January 2006, and as Section 5.1 directs that amounts spent in excess of the required sum in any covenant period shall be credited to the remaining covenant periods. Given these credits, we enter judgment in favor of the Foundation and against HCA (that is, HM Acquisition, LLC and HCA, Inc., jointly and severally) for shortfalls in the amount of $165,742,819. \n \n2. We reverse that portion of the judgment that HCA (that is, HM Acquisition, LLC and HCA, Inc., jointly and severally) shall pay to the Foundation prejudgment interest on any sum of damages that the trial court itemized with regard to shortfall damages, attorney's fees, or costs, for the period from October 2, 2009 (the date the petition was filed), to December 9, 2015 (the date of final judgment), at the statutory rate of nine percent per annum, compounded annually. \n \nWe order, instead, that interest on $188,074,491 (representing shortfall damages of $165,742,819 as herein awarded and attorney's fees and costs of $22,331,672 itemized in the Judgment) accrue at the statutory rate of nine percent per annum, simple interest, from and after the date of Judgment, December 9, 2015, until the Judgment as herein modified is satisfied in full. \n \n3. As so modified, the trial court's Judgment is in all other respects affirmed. \n \nFOOTNOTES \n \n1 .  \u2003Section 14.2 of the Asset Purchase Agreement (\u201cAPA\u201d) provides that: \u201cThe divisions of this Agreement into sections and subsections and the use of captions and headings in connection therewith are solely for convenience and shall have no legal effect in construing the provisions of this Agreement.\u201d \n \n2 .  \u2003In 2003, Health Midwest amended its articles of incorporation and became known as Community Health ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Health care industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Healthcare management news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Kansas City news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION OF GREATER KANSAS CITY v.

Sultan bin Saeed Al Mansouri, Minister of Economy and Head of the UAE delegation to the Partnership Summit 2017 in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, carried this message forward as he underlined the need to deepen the economic partnership and investment to push trade between the two countries beyond the US$50 billion (AED183bn) mark that was recorded last year. \n \n\"The agreements signed over the past week including measures to fight organised crime, terrorism, illegal migration and money laundering are the bedrock for a new chapter in our alliance with India.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. exit   \nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time. \n \n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne. \n \nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong. \n \nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show. \n \nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT.

She owns a comparatively humble semi at Northbridge, in her Willoughby electorate. Photo: Daniel Munoz \n    exit   \nSydney's booming spring property market has delivered the new Berejiklian government a budget windfall. \n \nThe amount of residential stamp duty flowing into the state coffers hit new monthly records in November and December, Office of State Revenue figures show. \n \nThe NSW government collected $730 million from the residential property transfers last month alone \u2013 about $100 million more than the previous December. November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier. \n \nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts. \n \nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July. \n \nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier. \n \nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016. \n \nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256. \n \nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years. \n \nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability. \n \nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\". \n \nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\". \n \nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year. \n \nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets. \n \nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16. \n \nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year. \n \nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion. \n \nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2871","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Forbes","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Forbes Advocate","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169702785","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Forbes Advocate","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.forbesadvocate.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196429419","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Mother wanted 'Antony' but my Dad spelt it 'Anthony' when he registered me.\"\n\nA third chimed in: \"I'm wondering if Clohe's mam was just dyslexic?\", while another said: \"Watching The Chase and wondering if Clohe's parents liked but couldn't spell the name\".\n\nHowever, it wasn't just her moniker which sparked criticism. Her performance also left viewers feeling underwhelmed.\n\nOne witty person said: \"Clohe's as good at answering these questions as her parents were at spelling her name,\" while another said: \"Clohe is as silly as the spelling of her name.\"\n\nAdding insult to injury, she also lost £1,000 for her team by accepting the minus offer. One viewer fumed: \"If they win any money Clohe needs to pay Catherine a grand for taking the minus!\".\n\nAs if things couldn't get any worse, the 28 year-old also revealed a rather bizarre phobia - of salad. When asked about holidays by host Bradley Walsh, she said: \"I went on my first holiday with my boyfriend to Valencia to La Tomatina, which is a tomato throwing festival.\n\n\"But I'm a bit scared of tomatoes. I used to watch a programme called Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and I think it's stuck with me.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sunday's papers"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"The Chase contestant\u2019s name bemuses viewers","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"MSN UK","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169588902","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"MSN UK","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Television","Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.uk.msn.com","publisher":"Microsoft Corporation"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.msn.com:80/en-gb/entertainment/tv/the-chase-viewers-left-bemused-after-typo-ends-up-being-contestants-very-bizarre-name/ar-AAmmutR?li=BBoPJKU&index=1"],"sequenceId":"695196432253","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And every day (I am exaggerating, but only slightly), the Pope issues another reminder that he does not approve of Catholics like me. \n \nIf the Holy Father were rebuking me for my sins, I would have no reason to complain. But day after weary day the Pope upbraids me\u2014and countless thousands of other faithful Catholics\u2014for clinging to, and sometimes suffering for, the truths that the Church has always taught. We are rigid, he tells us. We are the \u201cdoctors of the law,\u201d the Pharisees, who only want to be \u201ccomfortable\u201d with our faith. \n \nThe Roman Pontiff should be a focus of unity in the Church. Pope Francis, regrettably, has become a source of division. There are two reasons for this unhappy phenomenon: the Pope\u2019s autocratic style of governance and the radical nature of the program that he is relentlessly advancing. \n \nThe autocratic style (which contrasts sharply with promises of collegial and synodal governance) has never been quite so evident as this week, when he has tossed aside the independent and sovereign status of the Knights of Malta. Writing of  that remarkable coup  in the  Wall Street Journal , Sohrab Ahmari observed that it \u201chas divided the church along familiar lines.\u201d Ahmari (a recent convert to Catholicism) continued: \n  \nAs with other recent disputes\u2014communion for the divorced-and-remarried; the status of the Latin Mass; Vatican engagement with China\u2019s Communist regime\u2014conservatives are on one side and Pope Francis is on the other. \n  \nBut a Pope should not be on \u201cone side\u201d of disagreements within the Church. Certainly the Roman Pontiff must make decisions and set policies. But unlike a political leader, he is not expected to bring his own particular agenda to his office, to promote his own allies and punish his opponents. Whereas we expect President Trump to reverse policies of President Obama\u2014just as Obama reversed policies of President Bush\u2014we expect a Pope to  preserve  the decisions of his predecessors. Because Church is not, or should not be, divided into rival parties. \n \nEvery Pope makes controversial decisions, and every controversial decision leaves some people unhappy. But a prudent Pontiff avoids even the appearance of acting arbitrarily. Mindful of the fact that he serves as head of a  college  of bishops\u2014not as a lone monarch\u2014he does his best to  pro pose rather than  im pose solutions to pastoral problems. \n \nAlthough he exercises enormous authority within the Church, a Pope also acts under considerable restraints. He is empowered to speak for the universal Church, but in a sense he forfeits the ability to speak for himself. The Pope cannot be partisan. He is expected to settle arguments, not to start them. At the Council of Jerusalem, St. Peter set the standard for his successors: hearing out the arguments on both sides and then rendering a judgment (in this case, ruling  against  the stand that he himself had previously held). \n \nBy its very nature the Pope\u2019s role is conservative, in the best sense of that word. He is charged with preserving the purity and clarity of our faith: a faith that does not change. Since our fundamental beliefs were set forth by Jesus Christ, no prelate can question them without subverting the authority of the Church that our Lord founded\u2014the same Church that gives him his only claim to authority. While he is the supreme teacher of the Catholic faith, the Pope can only teach what the Church has always taught: the deposit of faith that has been passed down to him from the apostles. He can speak infallibly, but only when he proclaims and defines what faithful Catholics have \u201calways and everywhere\u201d believed. \n \nIn short the Pope cannot teach something new. He can certainly express old truths in new ways, but if he introduces actual novelties, he is abusing his authority. And if his \u201cnew\u201d teachings conflict with the established doctrines of the Church, he is undermining his own authority. \n \nMany faithful Catholics believe that with  Amoris Laetitia , Pope Francis has encouraged beliefs and practices that are incompatible with the prior teachings of the Church. If that complaint is accurate, he has violated the sacred trust that is given to Peter\u2019s successors. If it is not accurate, at a minimum the Holy Father owes us explanations, not insults. \n\nThis article was originally published on Catholicculture.org  and is re-published with permission.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Pope Francis has become a source of division opinion about 5 hours ago","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"CA","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"LifeSite","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169756655","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"532"},"name":"LifeSite","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lifesitenews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.catholicculture.org/","http://www.wsj.com/articles/pope-francis-routs-the-knights-of-malta-1485478113"],"sequenceId":"695196432630","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D.

But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official.

Two Liteez contain about two calories instead of 20 calories in one teaspoon of table sugar. \n \n\u201cThe idea was to craft a whole new concept for a healthier, tasty, and indulgent sweetener\u2013 to simply create a new experience for coffee and tea or as a casual snack,\u201d says Noam Kaplan, CEO of Lampados. \n \nThe patent-pending vegan meringue kiss is a plant-based snack, free from allergens such as eggs, gluten, lactose, or nuts, and contains only six simple ingredients. \n \n\u201cMany consumers crave something sweet both in and with their coffee,\u201d says Kaplan. \u201cOur new kiss fulfills both needs for a delicious, low-cal sweetener or as an indulgent dessert, without compromising on taste and while helping with weight management.\u201d \n \nLiteez was developed in collaboration with Practical Innovation, Israel, an award-winning global innovation company. \n \n\u201cOur mission was to help a traditional sweetener company make a completely novel product that takes the concept of sweet indulgence to a unique level,\u201d says Tal Laizer, CEO of Practical Innovation. \u201cThis is not just a new sweetener but an entirely new look and feel \u2013a complete 3D flavor experience.\u201d \n \nLiteez uses a vegetable protein that has the ability to foam like eggs to help create the desired kiss texture and form. Sugar\u2019s functionality is replaced with prebiotic fibers to form a stable foam and maintain the kiss shape, while being highly soluble in hot drinks, such as coffee or tea. \n \n\u201cWe hear a lot about sugar tax and sugar reduction. At the end of the day, consumers seek healthier sweetening choices, but they don\u2019t want to skip indulgent experience,\u201d says Kaplan. \n \n[embedded content]","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer: natural health news","group":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Vegan meringue kisses to sweeten your coffee","source":{"category":"Organisation","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"IL","country":"Israel"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Israel 21c","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169695379","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"36"},"name":"Israel 21c","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","InformationTechnology"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.israel21c.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196439885","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It was to talk about the pitfalls of life. \n \n\u201cI was 14,\u201d Slater recalled this week. \u201cHe wanted to talk to me and my brother about a life lesson.\u201d \n \nThe lesson was one that came as a shock at the time that Slater has never forgotten. It will not be lost on him next Saturday either. \n \nThat\u2019s when Slater will be handed Athletes In Action\u2019s Bart Starr Award at their annual Super Bowl breakfast, the same award his father won in 1996. A family of deeply held faith, the Slaters are the only father-and-son tandem to win the award, which is given annually to the NFL player \u201cwho best exemplifies outstanding character and leadership in the home, on the field and in the community.\u201d \n \nThe day before a teen-age Slater sat down with his father and brother to talk of difficult things, that award had been given to Atlanta\u2019s Pro Bowl safety Eugene Robinson. Later that evening, Robinson was arrested in a seedy section of Miami on a charge of soliciting an undercover officer, offering her $40 for oral sex. \n \nThe story made headlines around the country and shook the Falcons to their core. Robinson returned the Starr award and the next evening Atlanta was badly beaten by the Broncos, 34-19. A sluggish and distracted Robinson gave up an 80-yard touchdown completion to Rod Smith and badly missed a tackle on Terrell Davis in the fourth quarter that allowed a long run to the Atlanta 10 that sealed the game for Denver. The Robinson incident was believed by many to have crushed the Falcons\u2019 hopes, dulling their edge and leaving them ill-focused and lifeless. \n \nArt Shell was the Falcons offensive line coach at the time and drew the unenviable task of going to the police station to bail Robinson out and bring him back to the team hotel, where Robinson\u2019s wife and family were waiting for him. \n \n\u201cThat was the quietest car ride I ever had,\u201d Shell said this week. \u201cWhat could you say?\u201d \n \nNothing that night, but the next afternoon after Shell had dressed for the game, he walked into the locker room and didn\u2019t like what he heard. \n \n\u201cI went back and told (coach) Dan (Reeves) he better speak to the team because all they were talking about was what happened to Eugene,\u201d Shell recalled. \u201cIt was such a shock, they couldn\u2019t focus on the game.\u201d \n \nAn anonymous Falcons player confirmed as much to the New York Times after the game saying, \u201cInstead of getting mentally ready for the Broncos we were talking about Eugene. It was very tense.\u201d \n \nSo was Robinson, who suffered through a sleepless night and played like it the next day. Robinson, whose family remained intact despite the incident and who now works as a radio commentator on Carolina Panthers game broadcasts, addressed the Panthers last year before they left for San Francisco and Super Bowl 50. He also spoke publicly about the event with his hometown paper, the Hartford Courant, telling them, \u201cIt was painful. I cried the entire night. I was like, \u2018How did I get so far over here when I was way over there?\u2019 It\u2019s easy to lose your way when you\u2019re selfish and you\u2019re only thinking about yourself. That\u2019s what I did.\u201d \n \nPerhaps but Slater\u2019s father had a different message for his two sons. It was not about the fall of Eugene Robinson, but rather the acceptance that we are all only one weak moment, one bad decision from that same seedy neighborhood. \n \n\u201cIt was a teaching moment for me in my life,\u201d Matthew Slater explained. \u201cNo man is perfect. That was the lesson. \n \n\u201cI was old enough to kind of know what had happened, but my dad was not condemning Mr. Robinson. I can\u2019t overemphasize enough that what he said to us wasn\u2019t about Mr. Robinson. He just told us to understand we all fall short in life. Some circumstances you\u2019ll handle well. Others you won\u2019t. That\u2019s proven true in my life. \n \n\u201cYou try to be the best person you can. The best husband, the best father, the best son. But at the end of the day we\u2019re men and women. We make mistakes. It could happen to anyone. Who am I to pass judgment on him?\u201d \n \nKiddingly, Slater was asked if this was something he needed to be concerned with himself next Saturday in Houston, as the tension builds and the biggest game of the year approaches? \n \nHe smiled and said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d \n \nYet the reason he has been talking with Bill Belichick to try and fit the Starr breakfast into his and the team\u2019s Saturday schedule, is the same reason he feels as he does both about Robinson and the lesson he learned. \u201cI don\u2019t think so\u201d doesn\u2019t mean to him, \u201cI\u2019m better than that.\u201d \n \n\u201cI know who I am,\u201d Slater said. \u201cI\u2019m imperfect like everyone else. That\u2019s why it\u2019s really humbling to receive this award. It\u2019s important to me to be there. It\u2019s important to me that the Starr family know what he stands for to me. \n \n\u201cI respect that we have work obligations. It\u2019s important for me to be with the team. But who you are off the field supersedes what I do on the field.\u201d \n \nWhat he has done on the field is become a six-time Pro Bowler at a thankless and difficult job, running under kicks and punts with unbridled enthusiasm. But it is his realization that there are things more important than that, which says the most about Matthew Slater, the kid who has never forgotten the Super Bowl lesson of Eugene Robinson while never condemning him for making what we all do at times \u2014 a mistake.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - Denver Broncos news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - Atlanta Falcons news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Borges: Matthew Slater refuses to condemn but never forgets lesson of Eugene Robinson\u2019s Super Bowl mistake","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Middlesex","zipCode":"02149","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Everett","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Boston Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661766","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Boston Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bostonherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196442740","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

This analysis will highlight exactly which situations are the best to take advantage of and which you might want to avoid within those games. We\u2019ll also highlight a game to use caution with as well a less obvious target.\n\nOr at least that was the plan. With just two games on the final NFL DFS slate of the season, let\u2019s just break it down one at a time. Offense beat defense in this post-season, which is going to make for some great DFS.\n\nPittsburgh at New England\n\nTotal 51, Patriots -6\n\nThe Pats have enjoyed these high lines all season long, but typically with larger spreads. It\u2019s a little weird considering that New England has allowed the fewest points in the league and Pittsburgh is by far a lower scoring team on the road. The Patriots have been especially tough against opposing running backs, allowing just 83.5 rushing yards per game and four rushing touchdowns during the regular season. That doesn\u2019t bode well for superstar Le\u2019Veon Bell, who has rushed for 337 yards and two touchdowns so far in the playoffs. He\u2019s been the \u2018safe\u2019 road Steeler all season long, but given what we\u2019ve seen from New England\u2019s defense at home, I\u2019m having a hard time biting the bullet at $9,500. That leaves Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown to do the heavy lifting if Vegas is right about the Steelers team total. Well, let\u2019s not forget about Chris Boswell, but you know what I mean. Big Ben and Brown are the safest way to spend on Steelers this weekend, though Boswell is sure to be a hot play as the cheapest kicker coming off a 6-FG game in Kansas City.\n\nThe real attraction here is the Patriots, starting with Tom Brady and Julian Edelman. Though the Steelers had allowed only 20 passing touchdowns during the regular season and ranked 30th in fantasy points allowed to opposing wide receivers, I think we have to take Vegas into consideration here. I am a tad worried about the ability of the Steelers to rush the passer, ranking ninth in sacks (38), but Brady is well protected and healthy enough to evade pressure as he showed last weekend vs. Houston. I like Brady because I think after a heavy dose of Dion Lewis last week they\u2019ll be looking to shake things up with some deeper passes this week. That could provide some additional upside for guys like Chris Hogan and Malcolm Mitchell if he plays this week. Edelman remains the safest Patriot receiver by a long mile.\n\nLeGarrette Blount is another candidate for the Bill Belichick mix-it-up plan, as he was utterly disappointing vs. Houston last week (31 rushing yards). Pittsburgh allowed the sixth-most fantasy points to running backs this regular season and Blount has been overall better for DFS in home games. His price is nice, as they say, $500 below Dion Lewis\u2019, and I love Blount in tournaments. For that matter, Lewis is also a tournament-only play for me, though I think he will be over-owned based on last week\u2019s heroics.\n\nWith all four of these teams being offensive powerhouses, where do you go for defense? All four rank 25th or lower in terms of fantasy points given up to opposing defenses. The price difference between most and least expensive is only $400, so I\u2019m not letting that drive me too much. I like a home team, and the fact that New England has allowed the fewest points per game makes them the best option on paper. It\u2019s a position that may have to break some rules this weekend, since there are only four teams to draw players from as it is\u2014avoiding an offensive player facing your defense may not be as optimal as usual.\n\nGreen Bay at Atlanta \n\nTotal 61, Falcons -4.5\n\nThis is the highest point total I\u2019ve seen all season. But it makes some sense because among these four teams, the defenses of Atlanta and Green Bay are the most generous for opposing quarterbacks. Green Bay allowed the second-most passing yards per game (269), while Atlanta was right behind with 267 passing yards per game allowed. Both were top-seven in terms of fantasy points allowed to quarterbacks as well and allowed 31 passing touchdowns during the regular season. I think it\u2019s a mistake to not use one of Aaron Rodgers or Matt Ryan as your cash game quarterback this weekend. Julio Jones was limited by Seattle last week, but still caught six of eight targets and a touchdown pass. Don\u2019t let his toe worry you\u2014he\u2019s going to play and with the league\u2019s best WR matchup for fantasy (or worst secondary if you prefer), he should be a top play this week. Ryan has the ability to make Taylor Gabriel and Mohamed Sanu relevant too, which is also enhanced by the Packers defense. Sanu is the safer play while Gabriel is the more dynamic, volatile player. Use them accordingly.\n\nWith Rodgers, who appears unstoppable lately, you get the high volume floor and multi-touchdown upside. The issue is that without Jordy Nelson, the number one receiver is a moving target (see what I did there?). There are two tight ends, three receivers and a hybrid (Ty Montgomery) competing for Rodgers\u2019 attention plus there\u2019s a chance Jordy is back. That makes Rodgers an easy play, but there\u2019s no one receiver I trust absolutely given what I\u2019ve seen lately. Devante Adams is the target leader with Nelson out, so he\u2019s the safest receiving play of the bunch while Montgomery is the most versatile of the bunch and can take advantage of both the poor secondary of the Falcons, as well as their generous run defense.\n\nWhen it comes to the Falcons run game, Green Bay\u2019s defense ranked 8th in rushing yards per game (94.7). Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman were a vicious two-headed monster last week against Seattle and should continue to find success on the ground as defenses have to keep Ryan and Jones honest. I still prefer Freeman to Coleman based on the home/road splits and the slightly higher volume he sees. That said, if you can build a lineup you love and Coleman is the back that fits, I\u2019m okay with him too. Options are limited to say the least. Either kicker is fine here, but I won\u2019t be rostering either D/ST from this game.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Renee Miller"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Daily Archives - Starting Points: Conference","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fairfield","zipCode":"06901","state":"Connecticut","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Stamford","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Roto World","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665003","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"95"},"name":"Roto World","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["AmericanFootball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.rotoworld.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196443626","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.rotoworld.com/images/photos/NFL/ATL/NFL_Ryan2_300.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official.

However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council. \n \nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet. \n \nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney. \n \nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families. \n \nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\". \n \nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections. \n \nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies. \n \nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\". \n \nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts. \n \nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state. \n \nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs. \n \nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean. \n \nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts. \n \nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation. \n \nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader. \n \nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres. \n \nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts. \n \nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities. \n \nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing. \n \nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence. \n \nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following  Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics  after being told she could not remain in the portfolio. \n \nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment. \n \nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance. \n \nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected. \n \nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\". \n \n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" \n \nThe story Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019 first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2871","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Forbes","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Forbes Advocate","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169702785","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Forbes Advocate","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.forbesadvocate.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196448175","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It has to do with the turn of events in the North East of the country, which has been the hotbed of the Boko Haram insurgency. What is at stake here is the seeming indifference \u2013 if not active undermining \u2013 to the efforts at ending the years of horror the terrorists had visited on the country. \n \nThe December 24, 2016 capture of Camp Zero in Sambisa Forest, globally recognized as Boko Haram\u2019s last stronghold, should have provoked a zeal in stakeholders in the area to boldly step forward and deliver the non-combatant components of the anti-terror war to ensure the war is decisively won. Not much of such appears to be happening. If anything, the sense one has is of those in position of authority doing their best to return their sphere of influence back to the era of fear under Boko Haram\u2019s sustained attacks. \n \nThis trend is worrisome. The stakeholders in the north east, particularly those in Borno state, cannot continue to expect the whole country to clean up their mess without actively contributing to managing the situation they are largely credited with precipitating. Not a few experts have identified crippling poverty as the booster fuel that accelerated the growth of Boko Haram and sustained it \u2013 the poor population of youth without education or employment provide a ready pool of recruits for radicalization and militarization. Even though the whole of Nigeria is a developing country with widespread poverty issue, the leaders in Borno reportedly created the kind of poverty that is virulent as they diverted the resources meant for that area\u2019s population for personal investments in other states or imitate their counterparts to export their people\u2019s patrimony abroad. \n \nIf poverty was the fuel that propelled Boko Haram\u2019s growth, the sheer indifference of these stakeholders, coupled with their penchant for misleading the issue was the catalyst that allowed it mutate from a ragtag band of cudgel, machetes, bows and arrows wielding youths to the world most notorious terror group that shames even Daesh (ISIS). News clippings would easily show that instead of quickly nipping the problem in the bud at its sapling stage, Borno politicians were rather exploiting it for their own nefarious ends; some went as far as hiring the then emerging terrorists to eliminate their political opponents or at least assassinate their opponents and make the killings appear like Boko Haram attacks. \n \nAt a later stage, when the group was in mutation into the world\u2019s horror story, these stakeholders rather allowed it to fester, they milked it for all it is worth by setting up phantom contact groups and phony negotiations that were used to defraud the former administration. They supposedly fled their domains simply to qualify for handouts. All these streams of funding would dry up if the killer group was defeated so it was desirable for them to keep the attacks in place so long as money and influence keep flowing and the killers know where not to strike. \n \nBut that was before Boko Haram became a desirable bride to foreign terrorists organizations and completely went rabid. Its fighters turned on even their handlers \u2013 religion, ethnic affiliation, financial ties and all other previous considerations lost meaning for the now crazed murderers. \n \nIt is for this reason that Nigerians must condemn recent reports that Borno Elders, particularly those of Kanuri origin are reluctant to back peaceful initiatives being put forward by other stakeholders to bring the entire Boko Haram episode to a desirable close. Evidence of this abound in the conflicting stance they take on the issue of moving forward after Nigerian troops decimated, decapitated and humiliated the insurgents from their strongholds. The escaping fighters continue to attempt staging attacks without Borno Elders deploying their clout to corral them into submission. If anything, the utterances from these elders appeared to be encouraging the fighters that a re-group is possible. \n \nAn immediate and justifiable suspicion is to conclude that these elders are loath to see the last of the terrorists because they are still hopeful of some sort of monetary gain or influence peddling by sustaining Boko Haram as a bargaining chip similar to how elders in the Niger-Delta have declared terrorists militants their \u201cchildren\u201d that are free to run amok. This suspicion raises several questions and the answers to these would define the future of human existence in the north east. \n \nIn whose interest is the restoration of peace in Borno and the northeast? Why have the stakeholders in the north east refused to commit themselves to bringing about lasting peace in the region? What is the endgame of these stakeholders? How do they want the scenario playing out to end? \nWhatever the answers are do not in anyway detract from the strength and capabilities of the Nigerian military to bring the ugly scenario in Borno state and environs to a close at some point in time, after all the military is an enduring institution that would not go away. \n \nBut support from the stakeholders would potentially shorten the time needed for restoring normalcy to the area while reducing further loss of life to lone wolf attacks being staged by escaping terrorists. There is no doubt about the military\u2019s might but additional peaceful approaches are needed to bring about the needed peace for the people to heal their wounds and rebuild the region . Guns have never and will never bring people together just as elders are usually the ones with the institutional memory to make this happen. \n \nAs opposed to the current situation where the Borno Elders\u2019 response to the military exploits against Boko Haram has been criticism instead of acknowledgement one would like to see and hear them step in to call their clansmen to order and ask them to lay down their arms. One does not presently hear them call on their children to lay down their arms and put an end to the soft target ambushes that sadly often catch their own ethnic nationals in the crossfire \u2013 their improvised explosive devices have no capacity to discriminate as to who gets killed when they target helpless and defenseless citizens in the state. The fleeing elements still have the capacity to inflict pains on the people and the responsibility now falls in part on Borno Elders and stakeholders in the northeast to come up with workable idea since the military and security cannot be present in every single home. \n \nThe state governor, Kashim Shettima, should show the needed political leadership, put more efforts in the peace project by coming up with strategies that the other neighboring states can tap into to revive the entire northern region. As the Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, Shettima has to do more to see that the fleeing elements are prevailed upon within the shortest period of time to surrender their arms. The governor should see how he can galvanize his colleagues to inspire the districts and emirate councils along the line of what the Zurmi Emirate did when it handed over three Boko Haram suspects to the army. Once the terrorists realize they have no hiding places even among their own folks they will be encouraged to turn themselves in for reintegration. \n \nThe delay on the part of elders and stakeholders in kicking off such initiative is not one that should prolong inaction through self recriminations. On the internet, for the first time in history of the insurgency, we saw videos on YouTube inviting Nigerians and the rest of the world to the first Mega Rally for Peace in the North East region of Nigeria, right in Governor Shettima\u2019s backyard. It is an initiative he should take over if only to ensure that it can record more success in restoring normalcy to the state by pressuring the terrorists on the lose to give up. \n \nFor the Borno Elders, this laudable initiative for now is the best news to come out of Maiduguri in the year 2017. It could as well be the pathway for finding redemption for their previous failings. The peace efforts, while not initiated by them must not be jeopardized for political exigencies. Other Nigerians want peace all around and that would not be possible if peace does not reign in the northeast. \n \nKolawole PhD, a University lecturer, contributed this article from Keffi. \n \nTop Stories","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Anthony Kolawole: Who is afraid of peace in the North East","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Post Nigeria","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"594932946","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"12443"},"name":"Daily Post Nigeria","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://dailypost.ng"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196448378","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The plays are geared toward cash games unless otherwise indicated and I do try to use a price ceiling of $7000 for QB, $6000 for RB/WR, and $5500 for TE, but on this, the last week of NFL DFS, that is simply impossible. So what I\u2019ll do is run through the bargain options at each position and give my thoughts on pros and cons.\n\nQuarterback\n\nBen Roethlisberger $8000: The heavy exposure will be to Matt Ryan and Aaron Rodgers, but Roethlisberger could be sneaky for tournaments. New England has allowed the fewest points per game (see below), but has been particularly stingy in the run game. Saving over $1000 at QB allows you to do more at RB/WR than your opponents, and since QB is the most stable fantasy position from week to week, it\u2019s not a bad strategy. Basically, Big Ben is going to need to throw to keep up here and while I expect him to make mistakes, three touchdowns from him is totally possible. The road woes are enough of a concern for me to limit this strategy to tournaments.\n\nRunning Back\n\nTy Montgomery $6900: Montgomery is a great play as he is clearly even more of a centerpiece to the Packers offense without Jordy Nelson. He put up solid rushing and receiving numbers against Dallas in Dallas and will find much easier sledding in Atlanta. While the Falcons looked great against Seattle, their primary focus has to be on Aaron Rodgers, which should allow Montgomery a bit more room to run.\n\nLeGarrette Blount $6500: Yes, I\u2019m back in on Blount after the disastrous 31-yard performance last week. One thing you know about Bill Belichick is that he isn\u2019t going to run the same game plan two weeks in a row. Pittsburgh gave up the sixth-most fantasy points to running backs during the regular season, while Blount was a league leader in touchdowns, number two in carries, and top 10 in yards. If anything positive can be taken from the Divisional game, Blount should be fresh for a bigger role this weekend.\n\nTevin Coleman $6300: The final RB option in the bargain zone, such as it is this week, Coleman should not be expected to perform touchdown miracles this week. He\u2019s a salary-saving play that you should feel good about getting 12 fantasy points out of. Anything beyond that is icing on the cake. Green Bay is no slouch run defense\u2014in fact they ranked eighth in the league with just 94.7 yards per game allowed on the ground. However, Matt Ryan is going to keep them honest downfield and I expect both Devonta Freeman and Coleman to be busy.\n\nWide Receiver\n\nThere are some decent cheap options here, it\u2019s a matter of which you prioritize. Salary constraints will play a bigger role than usual, but I\u2019ve listed them in the order I prefer to roster them.\n\nRandall Cobb $6500: As long as Nelson is out, Cobb should continue to see high quality looks. He\u2019s known for his \u2018fluky\u2019 touchdown rate going back 2-3 years, and at some point, it\u2019s potentially not a fluke than Rodgers prioritizes Cobb near the end zone. It doesn\u2019t help that DeVante Adams has had some inconvenient drops either.\n\nTaylor Gabriel $6000/Mohamed Sanu $5800: This is the game to stack, and both Falcons WR2/3 guys could be useful. Green Bay was the best fantasy matchup for receivers during the regular season, and they allowed the second-most passing yards per game. Taylor has seen slightly more targets than Sanu, but it\u2019s Sanu who has scored in consecutive games (one without Julio Jones). I\u2019d love to see some fancy plays drawn up for Gabriel this weekend and he\u2019s my slight preference over the safer Sanu.\n\nChris Hogan $5500: Hogan is a possibility, but he too is dealing with a leg injury. It sounds like he\u2019ll be good to go, and coming off a really nice 4/95 on four targets game, he is clicking with Tom Brady at the right time. Pittsburgh was not a good receiver matchup this season, but as Vegas thinks offense dominates this weekend, and options are limited, good news about Hogan\u2019s health throughout the week put him in tournament lineups for me.\n\nMalcolm Mitchell $4700: If he plays\u2014a big if still at this point\u2014I prefer Mitchell to any of the other Patriots secondary receiving options (those behind Julian Edelman and Hogan). The dynamic rookie can make the big play that you want from a guy in this price range and I think Brady trusts him more than Michael Floyd, who saw only three targets last week.\n\nEli Rogers $4900: Rogers was targeted seven times in Kansas City, bringing in five for completions. That\u2019s consistent with his high efficiency during the second half of the season. Rogers is a desperation bargain play that I don\u2019t mind because the Steelers are going to be playing desperation football. A high efficiency guy is going to have some chances against this New England secondary that is going to be worried about taking Antonio Brown out of the game (production-wise, hopefully not physically).\n\nTight End\n\nMartellus Bennett $5500: On the one hand, I wish there was no requirement to roster a tight end at all this week. On the other, at least you can save some money here. Bennett catches passes from Tom Brady, and has been targeted four and five times in the last two games. Like most tight ends, his value depends almost exclusively on his catching a touchdown. Again, the good news is that he\u2019s done it three times in the last five games. Bennett is an equally good or better option than Cook for less salary.\n\nJesse James $5400: As I said for Roethlisberger above, I think the Steelers will be throwing a lot, and James is coming off his highest-yardage game. If Ladarius Green is back this week, then obviously avoid the Pittsburgh tight end situation, and if you\u2019re going cheap with Eli Rogers, one is plenty.\n\nDefense\n\nNew England Patriots $4400: With four of the league\u2019s best offenses facing off this weekend, defense is another position I\u2019d rather avoid if I could. New England and Atlanta are tied with the league\u2019s fewest giveaways, while Green Bay and Atlanta allow almost the most passing yards per game in the league. So those defenses are out. New England allowed the third-fewest rushing yards per game and the fewest points per game. With the Steelers coming in the middle of the pack in terms of turnovers, and most of those coming on the road, the Patriots are the best bet. They\u2019re the most expensive unit this week, but their price makes them a value relative to the most expensive defenses we had during the regular season (which were typically $5k+).","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Renee Miller"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - New England Patriots news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Daily Archives - Bargain Bin Conference Round","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fairfield","zipCode":"06901","state":"Connecticut","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Stamford","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Roto World","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665003","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"95"},"name":"Roto World","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["AmericanFootball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.rotoworld.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196448763","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.rotoworld.com/images/photos/NFL/ATL/NFL_Gabriel_300.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Without funds for an attorney, I accepted deferred probation. It has followed me my entire life. \n \nI graduated from college, law, and graduate school, yet I had to endure a hearing to ascertain my fitness to practice. It also caused employment rejection. \n \nLater, as assistant county attorney in El Paso, and elected district attorney in Willacy County, I routinely dismissed pot cases. Prosecutor\u2019s offices have limited budgets, yet mountains of cases. Dismissing marijuana offenses, allowed me to send more dangerous criminals to prison. \n \nEven probation for pot was wasteful. Curfews and reporting requirements should be for prowlers and burglars, not pot smokers. \n \nThis problem persists, as 620,000 Americans were arrested for pot last year. Yes, illegal marijuana creates jobs for probation officers, prosecutors, bailiffs, chemists, clerical staff and many more; however taxpayers get soaked. \n \nCalifornia and three other states legalized marijuana on Nov. 8. Voters were persuaded by the Colorado experience, where $2.4 billion in revenues and 17,000 jobs were created in legalization\u2019s first year. Some of this boom comes from visiting Texans. \n \nThe Denver Post polled, \u201cWould you repeal legalization?\u201d The answer; \u201cNo\u201d, by a 51 percent to 36 percent margin. Gallup\u2019s 2016 poll showed support for legalization has grown to 60 percent nationally, and recent studies demonstrate no increased use among youngsters since legalization. Colorado is booming, and other states want what they\u2019re smoking. \n \nThe old \u201cReefer Madness\u201d arguments against marijuana have been dispelled. Today\u2019s legalization opponents such as Insys Therapeutics, which develops synthetic painkillers, poured $500,000 into the \u201cNo\u201d vote in Arizona. It\u2019s these legal painkillers which cause so much addiction and harm. \n \nPrescription drugs increase our health costs and Big Pharma doesn\u2019t want competition. The Catholic Church was also a huge contributor, with the Boston Archdiocese donating $850,000 to oppose Massachusetts\u2019 marijuana initiative. \n \nOne lingering anti-pot argument is that people will ingest and drive. This happens anyway and it will be illegal everywhere. \n \nNot satisfied, opponents wonder how they will test for marijuana. Field tests still work, but how about we just arm each officer with a chocolate bar, and they could cuff the stoned drivers as they grab for it. \n \nLegalization will come eventually, as it\u2019s only the oldest age groups who are opposed. \n \nAn estimated 15 million Americans use marijuana regularly, and about half our population has admitted trying marijuana. \n \nMarijuana decriminalization bills for the 2017 Texas Legislature, have been filed, including one by El Paso\u2019s own Joe Moody. \n \nRepublicans are increasingly in favor, because of the fiscal benefits and individual freedom arguments. Democrats are already there, and almost everyone wants to decrease the power of the violent drug cartels who smuggle pot across our border. \n \nLet\u2019s legalize it, and have Mexico put up the wall to keep Texans from trafficking marijuana into their country. \n \nEl Paso attorney Steve Fischer has been a professor of criminology and a Texas State Bar director.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official.

In past years, all teams were grouped by leagues into divisions based on league strength. A team\u2019s placement is determined by performance over a two- or three-year period.\n\nThere are several noteworthy changes for the 2017 spring sports season.\n\nRiverside Woodcrest Christian\u2019s baseball program made a significant jump, moving into Division 2 for the upcoming season. Woodcrest Christian won the Division 5 title last season and also advanced to the semifinals in 2015.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. I knew it was coming,\u201d Royals coach Glenn Prater said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see good pitching anywhere, whether its Division 2 or 5.

Fontana Kaiser, last year\u2019s Division 4 runner-up, will be joining Woodcrest Christian in Division 2 this season.\n\nIn softball, Grand Terrace, Yucaipa and Moreno Valley Valley View will be joining the ranks of Division 1. Grand Terrace captured the Division 3 title last season. Yucaipa won the Division 2 title and the mythical national title in 2015. Valley View reached the Division 2 championship game last season.\n\nRedlands won back-to-back Division 4 championships in boys tennis, so it\u2019s not surprising to see the Terriers moved up to Division 2 this season. Temecula Great Oak, King and Temecula Valley also included in Division 2, each moving up a division. Menifee Heritage, which won the Division 5 championship last season, moved up to Division 4, as did Beaumont and Hemet.\n\nIn boys volleyball, Riverside Hillcrest moved up one spot to Division 1. The Trojans will be the lone Inland team competing in the top boys volleyball division.\n\nWhile most sports now are using competitive equity, there are a couple of exceptions. Track and field will continue to use enrollment for division placements, while swimming and diving will continue to place teams into playoff divisions by league.\n\nAll of the playoff division placements can be found on the Southern Section\u2019s website, cifss.org.\n\nContact the writer: Staff writer David Zink contributed to this story.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ERIC-PAUL JOHNSON"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: baseball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"CIF-Southern Section releases spring sports playoff groupings; Woodcrest Christian baseball...","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Riverside","zipCode":"92501","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Riverside","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Riverside Press Enterprise","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667020","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Riverside Press Enterprise","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pe.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://cifss.org/","https://pe.subscriberconcierge.com/subscriptionpanel?pid=22"],"sequenceId":"695196450290","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/okgucq-b88882691z.120170127171752000gm9lclq3.10.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Now, three-spine stickleback reproduce earlier in the season, and some reproduce more than once per season, a change from past behavior. \n \nThis is the first study to show that a fish had multiple breeding cycles in one season as a result of climate change, said postdoctoral researcher Rachel Hovel, the lead author on the study. Other studies have shown changes in breeding timing with changes in seasonal cues, but not this increase in breeding frequency in a vertebrate animal. \n \nHovel said the research was based on data collected through UW's Alaska Salmon Program, the long-running effort to track salmon, other fish species, and some other metrics like temperature, zooplankton abundance and related conditions in Bristol Bay. The study used fish size to determine when in the summer they were born, and combined that information with environmental data to look at how the size and time of birth related to water conditions. \n \nSticklebacks in Lake Aleknagik usually mature at age two or three, and can live for multiple years as breeding fish. \n \nSticklebacks are considered a model-organism, largely because they evolve and adapt quickly, and are a useful lens to see how fish can respond to environmental change, Hovel said. \n \n\"This study is importan?because it highlights a pathway by which some animals will respond t?climate change, and shows that it is more broadly expressed than we ha?previously believed,\" Hovel wrote. \n \nThe change at Lake Aleknagik is likely due to warmer water. There, ice leaves the lake about 10 days earlier in the spring than it did in the 1960s, Hovel said, which could be contributing to the reproductive changes. \n \n\"We hypothesize that this is primarily due to an early spring effect \u2014 the first brood is reared earl?enough in the summer that fish are able t?physiologically recover and spawn (or, in the case of males, spend about two weeks guarding the nest) an additional time,\" she wrote in an email. \n \nThe change could have multiple impacts in the lake. Stickleback make up about half the fish present in Lake Aleknagik, according to a University press release. \n \nJuvenile sockeye salmon compete with sticklebacks for food and habitat, and if more breeding time means more sticklebacks, it could also mean more competition for growing salmon. \n \nAn increase in sticklebacks could also increase the grazing pressure on zooplankton, a primary food source for sticklebacks. And, an increase could mean more sticklebacks available for predator fish. \n \nIt's hard to say whether the stickleback change is unique to Lake Aleknagik, because it's one of very few long-term data sets that could be used to look at such a question. But stickleback are common in northern lakes, and Hovel said the question could be studied elsewhere in a slightly different manner. \n \n\"However, it would be possible to conduct sampling over a shorter time period and determine whether other lake?show evidence fo?multiple broods in years with early spring an?early ice breakup,\" she wrote in an email. \n \nThe stickleback study used Alaska Salmon Program data collected at Lake Aleknagik from 1963 to 2015, including some collected by Hovel during the three summers she spent at UW's Aleknagik research camp. \n \nMolly Dischner can be reached at mdischner@reportalaska.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Environment news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Climate change news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Study shows sticklebacks are responding to climate change","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dillingham","zipCode":"99576","state":"Alaska","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dillingham","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bristol Bay Times","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169718633","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Bristol Bay Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thebristolbaytimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196453625","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

What initially was billed as a women's march became much more. Women, men and children came together, in solidarity, by the hundreds in small communities, the thousands in larger communities and the tens of thousands in the nation's cities. The signs they created showed a wide range of concerns, beliefs and most of all, hope that together, they could make the future brighter. \n \nSuch solidarity may well be unprecedented in the United States. According to one estimate, 4.6 million people marched on Saturday, which would make it the largest coordinated demonstration in America's history. The responses from those who attended these marches were similar regardless of whether they participated in Barrow or Boston\u2014 people felt a glow of optimism about the future \n \nSome naysayers might diminish the importance of that, saying it will take a lot more than a few cardboard signs to mend the divisiveness our nation is currently feeling. But history says differently. We are a nation founded on the belief that people need to be free from oppression. When colonists found taxation by English rule to be tyrannical, they rose up against it with a declaration of independence and founded a nation of the people, by the people, and for the people. \n \nThe United States has been shaped by similar realizations that the status quo was no longer acceptable \u2014 slavery was abolished, women were given the right to vote, and segregation was ended by movements that were inspired by the people, of the people and for the people. Smaller, but no less meaningful, efforts have resulted in workers rights, women's rights and environmental protections that many of us now consider standard parts of the fabric of our society. \n \nPerhaps the real reason behind the intensity of last weekend's marches was that many of us were reminded that we are, in fact, part of the process that shapes our nation. Politicians and special interests only hold the power to decide our future if we walk away from the process. This weekend, many people walked back into that process, perhaps for the first time in their lives. And the energy of that choice was palpable. \n \nWe live in a challenging time. Regardless of where you stand on the political spectrum, the messages we are receiving right now are divisive. We are getting bogged down in debates over how many people attended an inauguration, \"alternative facts\" and how our nation's new president doesn't escort his wife through the door of the White House. Meanwhile, policies that will shape our nation's future are being enacted \u2014 policies regarding trade with other nations, environmental policies and social reform, to name a few. These decisions require our attention and our response. \n \nLast weekend's march was a landmark event, but meaningful change will require sustained citizens involvement to produce a government that is truly of the people, by the people and for the people. Writing letters and copy and pasting emails will not be enough. One outgoing congressman recently said that the way to get the attention of politicians was to show up to events where they were speaking and question them specifically about why they voted a certain way on issues. While that may seem aggressive to some, that is, in fact, the political process. If your elected officials are making decisions you are not comfortable with, you have the right and the responsibility to question them about it. \n \nThe singular most important thing about last weekend's marches, however, was not the impression they made on politicians or public policy. The single most important thing about last weekend's marches was that it brought people together again, in communities, across states and across the nation. The pendulum of our politics swings back and forth, and we proceed forward on a path that lies somewhere in the middle. But for the system to work, we must all maintain respect for one and other and belief that working together, we will find a way forward. The solidarity felt by those who participated in those marches can be the starting point of that path, a path that is of the people, for the people, and most of all, by the people.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Opinion: Marches build much-needed solidarity","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dillingham","zipCode":"99576","state":"Alaska","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dillingham","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bristol Bay Times","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169718633","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Bristol Bay Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thebristolbaytimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196454017","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Our business culture needs to learn risk-tolerance and aggressiveness to compete in America's innovation economy. \n \nI came to this conclusion after asking eight successful innovators, investors and business experts why Alaska doesn't have more stories like Triverus, the Palmer startup I wrote about in my last column. \n \nMy visit to Triverus convinced me that high-value manufacturing is profitable in Alaska, as the company imports raw metal and exports unique machines to clean aircraft carriers for the Navy. Investors say there is plenty of money for good ideas and inventors are busy. \n \nIf Alaska's business people have the money, opportunity and ideas to create new industries, why aren't they doing it? \n \nTo some extent, they are. This decade has seen more Alaska startups. Facilities and support are in place to help them. Various inventors have contacted me and I know some are making good, especially producing outdoor recreation gear and after-market parts for aircraft. \n \nBut these are small potatoes, even in our tiny Alaska economy. And development is slow. Investors who want to put money into growth-ready innovation companies can't find them. Plenty of people have ideas, but few are prepared for the next step after the seed germinates. \n \n\"My partners and I have met with more than 60 startup companies,\" said Jamie Kenworthy, of the 49th Fund, an investor group. With $4.4 million to spend, they have closed only one deal in two years. \n \n\"There are plenty of good ideas. There are not the business skills to execute on that,\" Kenworthy said. \n \nStartup experts explained that creating a great new product is just the first step in starting a successful company. Ideas become profitable only when managed with skill in business growth. In Alaska, those skills are in short supply. \n \nHalf of Kenworthy's investment kitty came from a 2010 federal jobs bill that distributed money to the states for equity investment in growing companies. Gov. Sean Parnell's administration didn't apply for Alaska's share, so Anchorage did, becoming the only city with a federally funded angel investment fund. \n \nMayor Dan Sullivan hired Joe Morrison to get the city's $13 million allocation on the street. Morrison set up the 49th State Angel Fund, by 2014 putting the money in four investor funds that each put up a private match of at least a 50 percent. Then he left. \n \nThis week, Mayor Ethan Berkowitz hired Morrison back. Only $1.4 million of the federal money has been invested in businesses (not counting matching dollars). Morrison will work with the investors, or remake the entire program, to get it moving. \n \nInvestors say the primary problem isn't a lack of education among business people, although some cited a need for a greater emphasis on tech and innovation at the University of Alaska Anchorage. The deeper issue is that Alaskans haven't had to compete as businesses do in other states. \n \nPlenty of Alaska businesses compete for contracts with oil companies or the government, but that's different from creating new products and selling them outside Alaska. \n \nAs the national economy changed in recent decades, with new fortunes being made on risky investments in innovation, Alaska's economy coasted on money brought in by huge public corporations \u2014 oil and mining companies, cruise lines, air cargo carriers and fish packers \u2014 plus the military and government. \n \nHuman capital is lacking. Until the recent downturn, skilled young people in Alaska didn't need to start companies. High-paying jobs were plentiful in the oil patch, at the Native corporations, and on state and federal payrolls. \n \n\"The risk capital environment in Alaska is almost nonexistent,\" Morrison said. \n \nH. Ky Holland grew up here, left for 20 years to work in business in Oregon and California, and returned. He teaches business management at Alaska Pacific University, runs an investment seed fund, and has two startups. Holland said Alaska has a lifestyle economy \u2014 others in the field made the same point \u2014 in which people want to make enough money to support their fishing and skiing, but may not have the ambition for more. On the West Coast he saw fierce passion to compete. \n \n\"Alaska doesn't wake up in the morning thinking that way,\" he said. \"We think about what is the state budget and is the price of oil up or down. We don't think about how we can be more competitive globally.\" \n \nA lot of people are working to build an innovation culture in Alaska. Besides the money for startups, various programs offer mentorship and training, peer-support and space to work. Sponsors hope to build a community of entrepreneurs large enough to become self-supporting. \n \nAdvocates of this work hope it will diversify the economy and prevent Alaska from depopulating. \n \nI'm skeptical. The bonfire warming our economy is going out. This effort is like rubbing sticks together to make a spark. It's needed, but the initial flame will be small. \n \nWhen innovation powers an economy, a great university is usually nearby, said Palmer engineer and author Alex Hills. He built the first Wi-Fi network, technology he put into two successful startups, while working at Carnegie Mellon University. That university helped turn around the Pittsburgh economy. \n \n\"In the early stages you have to really pull these creative people in, and it's always a challenge to find them,\" he said. \"I think we'd be kidding ourselves if we thought this stuff was going to turn around the Alaska economy. It's not. It takes time.\" \n \nBut Holland said innovation doesn't only happen at startups. Existing businesses need to become more aggressive and competitive too, reaching out to new markets and pursuing new ideas rather than hunkering down. \n \n\"A lot of our current business leaders, who have been around a long time, they've made a lot of money, and their approach right now is to sit back,\" he said. \"Do you really think there's going to be a recovery? Is somebody going to fill up the pipe? Is oil going back to $140 a barrel? \n \n\"I want our Alaska businesses to grow our way out of this situation, not wait.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Opinion: Wealth weakened Alaska's spirit of innovation","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dillingham","zipCode":"99576","state":"Alaska","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dillingham","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bristol Bay Times","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169718633","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Bristol Bay Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thebristolbaytimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196456173","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A sale price was not disclosed. \n \nMike Faris, chief executive of Seattle-based Ocean Peace, confirmed that his company will acquire two Fishing Company of Alaska vessels. \n \nFrank O'Hara Jr., executive vice president of O'Hara Corporation, said his company will acquire the other vessel and half of the fishing quotas to harvest. He said these quotas will give his company a more diverse harvest that includes more higher-priced species. \n \n\"We could not be any happier for our company, all the crew and our customers and vendors,\" said O'Hara, whose company is headquartered in Maine but has an operations base in Seattle. \n \nThe North Pacific waters off Alaska yield the nation's biggest-dollar and biggest-volume harvests. \n \nFishing Company of Alaska, which once had a fleet of more than six vessels, was an important player in the trawl harvests that unfold in the Gulf of Alaska, the Bering Sea and off the Aleutian Islands. \n \nBut Fishing Company of Alaska's fleet has shrunk over time, in part due to high-seas disasters. Those include the 2007 sinking of the Alaska Ranger that killed five crew and the 2016 demise of the Alaska Juris, which did not result in loss of life but is the focus of a Coast Guard investigation. \n \nFishing Company of Alaska's vessels are part of the head-and-gut fleet, which harvests yellowfin sole, mackerel and other fish that are processed and frozen at sea. These harvests once were derby-style fisheries, where each vessel raced to grab as much as possible before fleetwide limits were reached. \n \nBut the harvests changed dramatically in 2008 as the North Pacific Fishery Management Council approved a measure \u2014 known as Amendment 80 \u2014 that divided the catch among companies, which could then form cooperatives. And Fishing Company of Alaska's extensive catch history enabled it to qualify for sizable harvest quotas that became a key asset that boosted its value. \n \nFishing Company Alaska was founded by the late Karena Adler, of Mercer Island, who died last year, after a pioneering career as a woman executive in a seafood industry where the top echelons are dominated by men. The company sale negotiations date back to the time when she still led the company, which is now owned by her children. \n \n\"We talked many times about the sale,\" said Mike Faris, of Ocean Peace. \"She was a tiny lady with a big spirit and strong will, and I really appreciated her spirit.\" \n \nO'Hara said his company also has a long relationship with Fishing Company of Alaska, and assisted them in joining a cooperative formed after the 2008 change in harvests. \n \nBoth under Adler's leadership and after her death, company operations repeatedly came under federal scrutiny, according to former Anchorage Daily News journalist's, Hal Bernton's report in the Seattle newspaper. \n \nIn 2008, the Fishing Company of Alaska paid almost $450,000 to NOAA Fisheries to settle charges of fishing in closed areas and other illegal activity by several of its factory ships. \n \nAt that time, it was one of the largest fines ever paid for fishery conservation violations. \n \nThe maintenance of the company's aging fleet of factory trawlers has been another issue, and a big focus for Coast Guard investigators as they looked into the sinkings of the Alaska Ranger and the Alaska Juris last summer. \n \nThe Coast Guard also has looked into the company's close ties with a Japanese fish buyer, which purchased all of the company's catch and kept small cadres of its employees aboard the vessels. \n \nOver the years, the Coast Guard received reports of conflicts with licensed U.S. crew, including three complaints filed with the Coast Guard in 2005 alleging assaults by a Japanese fishmaster on a U.S. mate working for Fishing Company of Alaska. \n \nIn the aftermath of the sinking of the Alaska Ranger, a Coast Guard marine board was concerned enough about the influence of Japanese crew to include a recommendation to investigate whether the vessel was \"improperly under control of an unlicensed non-U.S. citizen.\" \n \nConcerns about Japanese control of the Alaska Juris also came up during December Coast Guard hearings on the sinking of that vessel last summer, which forced the 46 crew to abandon ship. \n \n\"In my observation, he (the fishmaster) was definitely the guy in charge, telling the captain what course to follow,\" said the vessel's chief engineer Eddie Hernandez, who testified that he had witnessed the Japanese fishmaster at the wheel of the Juris and charting a course. \n \nThe vessel's captain, Paul Jopling, acknowledged during the hearings that he had sparred with the Japanese fishmaster over safety issues, but said he always retained command of the vessel. \n \nFaris, of Ocean Peace, said he has no plans to use any Japanese fishmasters aboard the two vessels that his company acquires in the sale. \n \nFaris said that his company intends to keep operating those vessels but will improve them: \"We will invest heavily in the vessels and bring them up to the level of safety and efficiency that we are real comfortable with.\" \n \nThe third Fishing Company of Alaska vessel also will continue to operate. \n \nO'Hara said it will be one of five that his company uses in Bering Sea harvests, and that his company is devoted to upgrading the vessels. \n \nIn a statement released to The Seattle Times, O'Hara wrote, \"best of luck to the Adler family ... their crew and ships are in good hands between Ocean Peace Inc. and O'Hara Corporation.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Fishing industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Mergers and acquisitions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Troubled FCA sells to two seafood companies","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dillingham","zipCode":"99576","state":"Alaska","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dillingham","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bristol Bay Times","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169718633","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Bristol Bay Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thebristolbaytimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196456564","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Unfortunately, how we solve this problem will have long-term implications for public policy (i.e. who benefits from and who pays for government services), the cost-of-living for families in our state, and whether future Alaskans will share in the wealth created by one generation's extraction of our most valuable resource \u2014 oil. Additionally, one might wonder if our solution to the fiscal crisis leaves us a government that is accountable to the will of the people, not just now, but into the future. \n \nImagine for a moment that the Prudhoe Bay oil era had never existed. Surely, we would now have a very different budget than the one we presently argue over. For 37 years, citizens of Alaska have largely not had to pay for their government services. Legislative budget-making has been a function of how much oil revenue flowed through government coffers each year. Little concern was expressed for how we could afford new programs and policies once the oil money was gone. Alaskan citizens paid scant attention to government expenditures because it only involved oil money, not taxes. Not everyone was disinterested in the budgetary process. Paid lobbyists were actively engaged in advising the Legislature about how to spend oil money. The upshot of three decades of relying on surplus oil money is that Alaska spends about $14,000 per capita on government programs while all other states spend about $5,000 to $7,000 per capita. \n \nClearly, we now need a budget much more like one that we might have, had the Prudhoe Bay era never happened. This means that the Legislature needs to re-examine every program and policy represented in the budget, even education formulas, and determine if we can really afford them in the context of normal revenue sources like a state income tax and sales tax. By all rights, the Permanent Fund Dividend shouldn't be needed; other states pay for government services without a Permanent Fund. \n \nBack to reality: we don't have income or sales taxes in place and re-evaluating every budget item takes time, likely years, after all it took decades to create our current budget. How do we buy time for intensive deliberations regarding budget items that benefit powerful constituencies? Unfortunately the answer is Permanent Fund earnings; there is no other pot of money large enough to draw on while we restructure government. The alarming problem is that current proposals want to make permanent changes in who owns the earnings of the Permanent Fund as though our \"crisis\" is permanent. \n \nSurely, Alaska will not always be in a state of fiscal crisis. Surely we can reconfigure government within our ability to pay for government services by conventional taxation. I propose that we agree to split Permanent Fund earnings with our government for 10 years, giving us time to reform our budget. \n \nCurrent plans ignore Governor Jay Hammond's declaration on announcing the PF dividend program that Permanent Fund \"oil wealth belonged to Alaskans themselves not the government.\" Current proposals conceive of Permanent Fund earnings as \"government money\" not \"the peoples' money.\" Never-the-less, the state's fiscal crisis belongs to all of us. As President Lincoln said, this is a government of, by, and for the people. We own this crisis. Consequently, I propose that we the people support a state income tax, a modest sales tax and share our Permanent Fund earnings for 10 years. Then the burden of reforming the budget will fall to our Legislature. \n \nPlans that make permanent government draws from Permanent Fund earnings essentially lock-in the current budget as though it is ideal for Alaska or that its design exemplifies decisions we would have made if Alaskans were asked to pay for it all along. Obviously that is not the budget that we have today. \n \nAccountability in Legislative budget-making comes from the tension that normally exists when lawmakers must tax citizens to pay for government programs. A direct draw from the Permanent Fund earnings means that perhaps $3 billion can be spent each year by government with about as much concern from taxpayers as Alaskans expressed over the last 37 years of spending oil money. It's that lack of accountability that explains why Alaska government expenditures are two times what other states spend. We can restore that tension, that accountability, by beginning to pay for our government services. Most importantly, let's find a solution that ultimately preserves ownership of the Permanent Fund by the people. \n \nI am a 41-year Alaska resident, currently engaged in property management and construction. My work experience also includes legislative policy analyst, president of a rural electric utility (GHEA), and service as a city and borough of Juneau assemblyman.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Opinion: The fiscal crisis is not just a math problem","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dillingham","zipCode":"99576","state":"Alaska","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dillingham","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bristol Bay Times","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169718633","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Bristol Bay Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thebristolbaytimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196457286","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A lawsuit brought by states would heighten the legal stakes surrounding the president's executive order, signed late on Friday, as courtroom challenges to the ban have so far mostly been filed by individuals. \n\nOfficials in the offices of attorneys general in Pennsylvania, Washington and Hawaii said on Saturday they were evaluating what specific claims could be filed, and in which court. \n\n\"We do believe the executive order is unconstitutional,\" Hawaii attorney general Douglas Chin told Reuters on Saturday. He declined to give further detail. \n\nThe states could decide not to file, and it is unclear how many states would ultimately sign on for such an effort. \n\n\"There certainly are conversations underway,\" said Joe Grace, a spokesman for Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro. \n\nA Trump representative could not be reached immediately for comment. \n\nTrump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. He told reporters in the Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \"not a Muslim ban\" and said the measures were long overdue. \n\nHowever, his order hit a roadblock late on Saturday when a federal judge in New York said stranded travelers could stay in the country. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the emergency court order, said it would help 100 to 200 people with valid visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports after Trump signed the order. \n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it would comply with judicial orders but that Trump's immigration restrictions remained in effect. \n\n(Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco; Editing by Paul Tait)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"States discussing lawsuit over Trump immigration order","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"SG","country":"Singapore"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Yahoo!

Opposed were Israel Peyton, Orville Huntington, and Al Kain, according to Alaska Department of Fish and Game biologist Mark Stichert in Kodiak. \n \nThe fish board is composed of seven members, and four \"aye\" votes are required to approve an action. One board member who could have cast a tie-breakding vote, Susan Jeffrey, recused herself, and abstained from voting citing a conflict of interest because a family member owns individual fishing quotas, Stichert said. \n \nThe Alaska Department of Fish and Game in October canceled the Tanner fishery, citing conservation reasons. The quota in the last Tanner fishery of 2015-16 was 19 million pounds. \n \nCrab fishermen and local governments made requests to the state to allow at least a limited Tanner fishery, with appeals coming from the city governments of St. Paul, Unalaska, and Alaska Bering Sea Crabbers. \n \nMeanwhile, snow crab fishing in the Bering Sea is \"off to a slow start,\" but is expected to pick up as boats longer than 60 feet finish fishing for Pacific cod with pot gear switched over to crab, according to ADF&G shellfish biologist Ethan Nichols in Unalaska. \n \nAs of Tuesday, 27 crab boats had landed 4.8 million pounds of opilio snow crab, for 22 percent of the quota, he said. The quota is 21.5 million pounds, about half the size of the previous season. \n \nThe first deliveries of snow crab were made after Jan. 1, and 33 boats are registered, a number that could increase to 45, as pot codders switch to crab. The average weight per snow crab is 1.3 pounds, and the average catch per pot is 203 crustaceans, also known as catch per unit of effort.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Fish board nixes Tanner crab season","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dillingham","zipCode":"99576","state":"Alaska","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dillingham","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bristol Bay Times","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169718633","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Bristol Bay Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thebristolbaytimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196457697","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Bogoslof is on an island about 60 miles west of Unalaska. \n \n\"A volcanic cloud was observed in satellite data beginning at (5 a.m. Alaska time),\" AVO staff wrote. \"Subsequent images show the volcanic cloud moving towards the east. The cloud is ice-rich, but likely contains volcanic ash.\" \n \nMichelle Coombs, the observatory's scientist in charge, said volcanologists notified state officials early Tuesday but had expected only possible trace amounts of ashfall in Unalaska. \n \nBrian Hagenbuch, a general aviation meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Alaska Aviation Weather Unit in Anchorage, said that an advisory to pilots for the ash cloud was canceled at about 11:20 a.m. \n \nThe cloud passed over Unalaska between 7 a.m. and 7:30 a.m., Hagenbuch said. Its subsequent track on radar took it east over the Gulf of Alaska, where it dissipated later Tuesday morning. \n \nBogoslof has been erupting since mid-December, sending ash clouds to altitudes of up to 31,000 feet. Last week, an ash cloud from the volcano forced several aircraft to divert around it. \n \nCoombs said there wasn't any immediate prognosis for future eruptions at Bogoslof, given its unstable behavior. \n \n\"We feel like it's Groundhog Day because it keeps erupting, but previous eruptions have lasted three weeks \u2014 we're already beyond that,\" Coombs said. \"Certainly these eruptions, these explosions, could continue on, but we'll just have to see.\" \n \nAt about 9:45 a.m. Tuesday, AVO said it had been tracking an \"energetic earthquake swarm\" since Monday near another Aleutians volcano, Takawangha. A description of the volcano, about 60 miles southwest of Adak, notes that \"no historical eruptions are known from Takawangha.\" \n \n\"The earthquakes locate 6 to 7 kilometers (east-southeast) of Takawangha volcano,\" AVO staff wrote on Facebook. \"This activity may be due to brittle failure in the surrounding rock caused by magma movement.\" \n \nAlthough no eruptive activity was detected at Takawangha, the observatory raised its aviation color code to yellow and its alert level to advisory. Bogoslof's aviation color code remained at red and its alert level at warning, the advisory's highest levels. \n \nThis story first appeared in the Alaska Dispatch and is reprinted here with permission.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Bogoslof sends ash over Unalaska; Takawangha rumbles","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dillingham","zipCode":"99576","state":"Alaska","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dillingham","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bristol Bay Times","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169718633","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Bristol Bay Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thebristolbaytimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196462883","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kaabil and Raees were termed as one of the biggest box office battles of 2017 but Hrithik Roshan is happy that his film has been loved by the audience and critics alike despite the competition at the box office. The actor, however, feels such clashes are not good for the film industry and fans.\n\nRakesh Roshan had expressed displeasure over this box office clash of \u201cKaabil\u201d and \u201cRaees\u201d and the actor says his father merely wanted to protect the film industry from the\n\nclash as producers suffer financially. \u201cHe (Rakesh Roshan) was talking about equality. These are things human beings have been fighting for since we have gained consciousness, freedom and equality,\u201d Hrithik told PTI. \u201cMy father is talking about the progress of the industry, producers and for people, who can\u2019t watch two films in a week on the big screen with family as it costs money. So, it is better for everyone that this (big) kind of clashes don\u2019t happen.\u201d Both SRK and Hrithik\u2019s films have been received well at the box office but the actor feels two big budget releases create unpredictability.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of uncertainty this time because of the clash. If it was a solo film, we would have been on the predictable note but because of the clash there was uncertainty,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now the uncertainty is turning into certainty with all the feedback and love that we are getting. It comes to down to the same thing \u2013 if the film and content are good it works, you get rewards no matter what,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe 43-year-old actor, however, insists there is nothing much an actor can do in this as these are trade decisions. \u201cIt is not for me to say. I have nothing to do with it. I am an actor and my focus was to better my work. Everything else is a story. If someone tells me anything about this person or that person its a story for me.

Last year Hrithik\u2019s \u201cMohenjo Daro\u201d released along side Akshay Kumar starrer \u201cRustom\u201d and the latter came out as a winner of box office tussle. Also Read: Ask Hrithik if he would now try to avoid a clash of his films with others, he says, \u201cThis is not in my hands alone, it is in the hands of executives. There is a rule that if we clash then we straight away divide it 50:50 (referring to screen space).\u201d \u201cSo, there is no 80:20 or 60:40 and if you follow 50:50 then the clash will stop automatically. That\u2019s the best way,\u201d he says.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Movie business news","group":"Media"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Big box office clashes not good for industry and fans: Hrithik Roshan","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Indian Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660698","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"Indian Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196468062","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:34Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/hrithik-roshan-4802.jpg?w=450"},{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/hrithik-roshan-4802.jpg?w=480"}],"video":[]}}

Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

The state database tracks a person\u2019s prescription history in efforts to avoid drug shopping habits by people with a substance abuse disorder. \n \nVeterinarians were included in the state PMP because there have been reports across the country of addicted people diverting medications like Tramadol, Ketamine and Valium, intended for a pet\u2019s care but used by the pet owner instead. \n \nCindy Heister, a longtime employee at the New Hampshire Board of Veterinary Medicine, part of the state\u2019s department of agriculture, said she has heard that some vets have had suspicions that drugs were being diverted and misused, but they are few in New Hampshire. She said in her 20 years, she can only remember about four times when this was brought to her attention. \n \n\u201cI have heard of Tramadol being a drug of concern since it is a narcotic prescribed to animals,\u201d Heister said. \u201cWe would report any information we received on misuse to the State Police. We would not handle it here.\u201d \n \nRepresentative Carol McGuire, R-Epsom, a sponsor of the bill, said it came about partly because there was an unanticipated fiscal impact to veterinarian\u2019s if they take part in the PDM as the rules are written. She said the bill could be used to amend the rules to address the impact if the Legislature decides vets need to be included in the PDM. \n \n\u201cFirst, a veterinarian\u2019s patients are not in the PDM database,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cIt is extra effort for them to do this. This is also an ethical issue for some vets who do not feel they are equipped to check on the pet owners, who are not their patients.\u201d \n \nMcGuire said the result might be that it is no longer mandatory for veterinarians but it could be optional, giving them more leeway on doing the database checks. \n \nState Rep. Jim Belanger, R-Hillsborough, testified in favor of HB291 on Tuesday, on behalf of his son, who is a veterinarian. \n \n\u201cSay my son treated my dog named Buddy, who needs medication for a hip injury,\u201d Belanger said. \u201cIf I sent the dog to the vet, he is supposed to do a background check on me? I feel my family\u2019s medical information is none of the vet\u2019s business.\u201d \n \nBelanger said he thinks the bill is too far reaching. \n \n\u201cI understand the concept, what it is intended for,\u201d Belanger said. \u201cI think it is flawed and needs to be looked at.

She owns a comparatively humble semi at Northbridge, in her Willoughby electorate. Photo: Daniel Munoz \n    exit   \nSydney's booming spring property market has delivered the new Berejiklian government a budget windfall. \n \nThe amount of residential stamp duty flowing into the state coffers hit new monthly records in November and December, Office of State Revenue figures show. \n \nThe NSW government collected $730 million from the residential property transfers last month alone \u2013 about $100 million more than the previous December. November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier. \n \nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts. \n \nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July. \n \nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier. \n \nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016. \n \nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256. \n \nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years. \n \nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability. \n \nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\". \n \nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\". \n \nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year. \n \nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets. \n \nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16. \n \nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year. \n \nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion. \n \nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2800","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Orange","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Central Western Daily","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169694320","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"Central Western Daily","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.centralwesterndaily.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196469941","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council. \n \nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet. \n \nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney. \n \nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families. \n \nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\". \n \nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections. \n \nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies. \n \nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\". \n \nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts. \n \nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state. \n \nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs. \n \nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean. \n \nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts. \n \nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation. \n \nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader. \n \nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres. \n \nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts. \n \nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities. \n \nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing. \n \nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

In practice, experts say, that policy will freeze millions of dollars in funding that has gone to critical health treatment, including HIV testing and neonatal care. \n \nThe United States does not fund any abortion services overseas, but many health groups receive American assistance to provide other women's services, while using different funding sources to provide abortion counseling and procedures. Now, those organizations will have to stop providing abortion services if they want to continue to receive U.S. aid for their other programs. The policy is known as the \"global gag rule\" because it even restricts references to abortion in counseling sessions. \n \nOrganizations such as Planned Parenthood, which receives about $100 million per year from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), have said that they will continue to provide abortion services, forgoing the U.S. funding and closing other programs. But other groups will probably stop providing the services. \n \n\"There will definitely be an increase in unmet need, and some women might lose lives because of exposure to unsafe abortions,\" said Yilma Melkamu, director for programs at the International Planned Parenthood Federation. \n \nIn Kenya, public health experts raised immediate concerns about the new policy. Women here often resort to dangerous methods to end their pregnancies, including drinking battery acid and using wire coat hangers. In parts of rural Kenya, young women have hired local healers to stomp on their stomachs until the pregnancy is deemed over. \n \n\"Trump's policy means even fewer services will be offered,\" said Chimaraoke Izugbara, a researcher at the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC) in Nairobi. \"Some women will not be reached, and providers may not be available to offer services. I think we are headed to a major disaster.\" \n \nNearly 8,000 women in Kenya die every year from complications caused by pregnancy and childbirth. At least a fifth of those deaths are caused by self-induced abortions, according to Izugbara. \n \nGroups that oppose abortion celebrated the new U.S. policy. Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said it would \"put an end to taxpayer funding of groups that promote the killing of unborn children in developing nations.\" \n \nMost sub-Saharan African countries have restrictive abortion laws. In Kenya, for example, abortion is legal only if a doctor decides there is a \"need for emergency treatment.\" Private organizations are often the only option for women in search of safe access to abortion. \n \nIn some cases, those women were the victims of sexual violence, according to Planned Parenthood, including refugees who were raped. Each year, about 1.6 million women on the continent are treated for complications from unsafe abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization based in New York. \n \nThe International Planned Parenthood Federation uses its USAID funding to provide contraceptives in Ethiopia, counseling for HIV/AIDS patients in Kenya and family planning services in Nepal, among other things. Some of those programs will probably be shuttered when the group loses U.S. aid. \n \nIn a statement, the group said it \"will not support policies which actively restrict or take away an individual's right to choose.\" \n \nA similar policy was implemented under President George W. Bush. Researchers discovered that the policy seemed to lead to \"increases in abortion rates in sub-Saharan African countries,\" according to a report published in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization in 2011. \n \n\"The results were exactly the opposite as the intended effect of the policy,\" said Eran Bendavid, one of the researchers and an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University. \n \nOne possible reason for the increase was that the U.S. policy, while aimed at abortion, curtailed the activities of organizations that provided condoms and other birth-control methods, resulting in more unwanted pregnancies, the study said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Kevin SieffThe Washington Post"},"topics":[],"title":"Trump's revival of the antiabortion 'gag rule' could have a big impact in Africa","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle","Health"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196470299","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Not that either. What it does show is how difficult it can be to sort the hype from reliable dietary advice when studies are funded by the makers of Froot Loops, nutrition science is often inconclusive, and gray areas can be spun for marketing. \n \nTake Special K. In the 1990s, Special K boxes featured findings that people who didn't normally eat breakfast lost more weight after they started doing so. \n \n\"That was the little piece they put on the cereal box,\" said David Schlundt, a co-author of the study of about 50 women. Not mentioned on those boxes: Regular breakfast eaters who started skipping the meal lost even more weight, compared to those who stuck with their routines. \n \nThat doesn't mean particular breakfasts can't help some people control their appetites, or bring other benefits like energy. Schlundt's study was tiny. But it shows how easy it is to simplify the complexities and limitations of nutrition science and cherry-pick the findings. \n \nOur understanding of what's healthy can evolve, which is why dietary guidelines are regularly updated to reflect the latest science. A recommendation that breakfast can help with weight control \u2014 inserted in 2010 \u2014 is no longer in the guidelines. With its last update, the government says it looked at broader eating patterns. \n \nA look at some research around breakfast and weight illustrates why advice about it is so tricky. \n \n\"White hat\" bias \n \nTo investigate the long-held idea that breakfast can prevent weight gain, researchers in 2013 reviewed dozens of studies examining the premise. Their conclusion: Popular opinion outweighed the scientific evidence. \n \nA major issue they identified was that studies often misleadingly used language to indicate that breakfast influenced weight, even though the findings did not establish a cause-and-effect relationship. Like a lot of nutrition research, the studies drew links between physical traits and what people said they ate. \n \n\"It goes back to the idea that correlation doesn't equal causation,\" said Andrew Brown, one of the researchers who conducted the analysis. Brown, a nutrition scientist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, noted that it could be that heavier people were skipping breakfast in hopes of losing weight. \n \nWhen citing past studies, scientists also tended to mischaracterize inconclusive results in favor of breakfast. Brown chalked that up to \"white hat\" bias, since people are constantly told breakfast is \"the most important meal of the day.\" \n \nBrown also noted that \"breakfast\" can consist of any number of possibilities, whether it's cold pizza, yogurt or an egg sandwich. \n \nIt's possible to question all sorts of dietary ideas. A study published last month, for instance, said the science behind recommendations to limit sugar was weak. That study drew criticism from health advocates because it was paid for by an industry group that includes Coke and Hershey \u2014 but it underscored the vulnerability of dietary recommendations. \n \nTimothy Caulfield, an expert in health law and policy at the University of Alberta, said nutrition science often comes with uncertainties and shouldn't be discarded just because it doesn't provide slam-dunk evidence. He said health experts give advice on the best available research, but there needs to be greater understanding about its limitations. \n \nWith breakfast and weight, Caulfield said there hasn't been a pendulum swing in the data, just that the evidence doesn't seem as powerful as once believed. \n \n\"Not good, not good\" \n \nDisclosures about who paid for the research became the norm only in recent years, so it's unclear how much of the literature on breakfast and weight from past decades was funded by breakfast food makers. The 1992 study featured on Special K boxes, for example, doesn't list a funding source. Schlundt told the AP that Kellogg paid for it. \n \n\"Only the ideas they see as favorable get money,\" Schlundt, an associate professor at Vanderbilt, said of industry-funded research. \n \nEven when funding is disclosed, people may not realize that not all studies are that meaningful. \n \n\"The paper is not good, not good = There are major structural problems with it that cannot be fixed,\" Carol O'Neil, a professor at Louisiana State University, wrote to her co-author in 2011 about a Kellogg-funded study, according to emails obtained through a records request. \n \nO'Neil and her co-author wanted to withdraw the paper from submission, but felt they couldn't because Kellogg expected it to be published. When the paper kept coming back with notes, O'Neil said she didn't see a way around the problems. \n \n\"But let me look at the comments again and see if there is some sort of clever verbiage we can present,\" she wrote. \n \nThe paper did not find a link between cereal consumption among Mexican-American children and better weight, but found one between cereal and higher nutrient intake. As eventually published in 2013, it concluded that nourishing breakfasts \u2014 including those with cereal \u2014 should be encouraged. \n \nO'Neil did not respond to requests for comment. Kellogg said it is unable to comment on the study and the research by Schlundt because they were done long ago. General Mills, which has funded studies about breakfast, cereal and weight, declined to comment. \n \nAnother study funded by Kellogg last year found breakfast consumption was not consistently linked with differences in weight among Canadian adults. It found people who ate cereal had lower weights than those who ate other types of breakfast, though results varied by age and sex. \n \nYoni Freedhoff, an obesity expert at the University of Ottawa, said many of his patients find protein-rich breakfasts help control their appetites.

It could be digging a hole, same principle. Unfortunately, most people do not exercise regularly. Suddenly they go outside to move what could be hundreds of pounds of snow. It\u2019s like going to the gym for the first time and going wild.\u201d \n \nDr. Jeffrey Kuvin, a cardiologist at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, said people tend to be less active in the winter months than they do in the warm weather, so even a person who is usually in good shape may be less so this time of year. \n \nAnother factor working against people who are out of shape is the cold. \n \n\u201cSnow is wet and heavy, and we are going from a warm, cuddly house, outside to tackle the snow piles,\u201d Kuvin said. \u201cWe feel obligated to take on this strenuous behavior, which taxes our muscles and our heart.\u201d \n \nKuvin said there is some evidence that the blood thins in the cold, increasing blood clotting factors. \n \n\u201cWhen you go from a warm house to outside in the cold, blood vessels constrict. Clotting factors work harder and a blood clot is more likely. Blood pressure and heart rate increases with the activity. It is a perfect setup for a heart attack so not a big surprise when it happens.\u201d \n \nFor many who are stricken, there may be an underlying heart condition that the person is not aware of, said Goodkin. \n \n\u201cSometimes, the symptoms are misread,\u201d said Kuvin. \u201cPeople attribute the chest and muscle pain, the sweating, dizziness and nausea to the stress of the activity. Be very aware of the symptoms and what they could mean.\u201d \n \n\u201cI tell my patients to not underestimate the power of snow,\u201d Goodkin said. \u201cI tell them to treat it like the gym and warm-up first with some stretches or light exercise indoors. When they shovel, take light loads and rest breaks as needed. Make sure to stay hydrated.\u201d \n \nA heart attack is not the only risk when shoveling snow. Dr. Richard Feeney of Core Physiatry in Exeter said shoveling snow is a great way to injure the back. \n \n\u201cWe see a lot of people in pain in our practice,\u201d Feeney said. \u201cShoveling snow is a common cause of back pain related to the spine. We see a lot of lumbar disc herniation, injury to the soft tissue between vertebrae.\u201d \n \nFeeney said shoveling is the perfect storm for spinal injuries. \n \n\u201cLeaning forward is a flexor stressor,\u201d Feeney said. \u201cThen there is a lot of rotation involved. There is increased pressure to the intervertebral discs. This can happen as a natural part of aging, too, but shoveling is a good contributor. People who may not be in the best shape are suddenly going from zero to 60.\u201d \n \nKuvin said people should consider whether they are physically fit enough to shovel snow, or if they should consider getting help from others. \n \n\u201cIf you take it on by yourself, know your limitations,\u201d Kuvin said. \u201cWarm up and acclimate yourself to the cold. Most important is to know when you have reached your limit and stop. We see a lot of patients who decided to shovel or snow blow their driveway, and had a heart attack.\u201d \n \nFeeney said if a person does take part in a core stabilization program, he or she strengthens the core and is better able to tolerate shoveling. \n \n\u201cIf not, a better idea might be to delegate,\u201d Feeney said. \u201cI ask my patients \u2013 would you rather pay a neighborhood kid $10 or hire a plow person, or risk the injury?\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Karen Dandurant"},"topics":[],"title":"Shoveling snow safely","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle","Health"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196470766","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

With a little preplanning, however, a healthy lunch can assist with fueling, nutritional, and weight goals. \n \nWhen lunches are eaten out, they can often contribute to excess calories, low nutrient intake, overconsumption of less healthy food ingredients, and fatigue (as the body focuses on digesting larger amounts of food or \u201cheavier\u201d food options). \n \nLunches may also be a meal that is skipped. This might be due to a lack of planning, a busy schedule, overconsumption of filling beverages, or the misconception that skipping meals will assist with weight loss. Not eating lunch, however, can lead to fatigue, inadequate intake of important nutrients, a craving for less healthy options and overeating the rest of the day. \n \nPrioritizing a healthy, appropriately-sized lunch can be extremely beneficial. Think of it as a mini brain vacation that will send you into the afternoon with better fuel and increased efficiency. As you decide what to eat, think by food groups and ideally have each represented. Consider writing down possible lunch combos that you might put together when eating out or when packing a lunch. Maybe write these ideas on index cards as a handy reference. \n \nWhen it comes to addressing the potential problems of eating out, there are several actions steps that might be helpful. For people with jobs that include a lot of car travel instead of being at the mercy of eating establishments along the way, consider packing meals and snacks in your car. You can choose to pack less perishable foods or take along a small cooler. \n \nThe same is true if you have a desk job where packing lunch not only puts you in total control of the types and quantities of food you eat for lunch, but can also save you money. \n \nIf packing food is not possible, seek out eating establishments that are more likely to offer healthier foods and where you have the option of smaller portions. Be on the lookout for foods high in sodium, saturated fat, added sugars, or fried foods and limit these. Choose less processed higher fiber foods (whole grain products, fruit, vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds) when possible. \n \nWhen a school or work site has a cafeteria, consider which are the healthier offerings. Salad bars may be a good choice for a lunch or side dish, but watch the higher calorie \u201cextras.\u201d Ideally, your salad should include dark leafy greens, lots of colorful vegetables, and a source of healthy protein (grilled chicken, fish, beans, nuts, seeds, eggs, etc.). \n \nIf you have chosen a salad as your lunch entrée, don\u2019t forget to also include a source of whole grain, a starchy vegetable, milk, yogurt, fruit, beans, or other source of healthy carbs as part of the meal. These provide brain and body fuel for the afternoon, especially if you plan to be physically active. Choose an oil-based or lite dressing rather than fat-free if the meal has no other fat source (some nutrients needs a little fat for absorption). \n \nIf you prefer sandwiches at lunch, keep in mind a few guidelines, whether you are purchasing it at a sandwich shop or packing one from home. Choose whole grain bread products \u2013 bread, pita, wrap, roll, bagel, etc. Note that some bread products count as more than one or two servings of grain. For instance, a 4-inch bagel or a whole large pita equals about three to four slices of bread. A 6-inch sub roll and most large wraps count toward about three slices of bread. If the bread item has a label, stick to an amount that provides no more than about 30 grams of carbohydrates (about two grain servings) for the whole sandwich. \n \nFor protein, choose lean meat or poultry items or fish, while limiting processed meats. If you are packing your own lunch, consider cooking some chicken or turkey breasts, cutting them into bite-sized pieces, and portioning these into snack bags. Some can be frozen for later use, and the rest can go in the refrigerator as an add-in for sandwiches, salads, soups, or stir fries. Proteins might also include nut or seed butters, hummus, beans, or eggs. Limit high fat cheeses which contain a lot of saturated fat and calories. \n \nSome sandwiches can hold veggies as well. You could also add a salad, vegetable soup, or some raw veggies on the side. These not only provide a lot of nutrients, but can fill you up on fewer calories, leaving less room for excesses of other sources of calories. \n \nBe careful of the condiments and sandwich spreads you use. Some of the better ones might be assorted mustards, hummus, guacamole, sun dried tomato paste, olive tapenade, horseradish spread, or pesto. \n \nConsider what you could include in your lunch that provides some calcium. It could be a glass of milk or soy milk, a latte, yogurt, cottage cheese, or some low-fat cheese. Some of the milk alternatives are fortified with calcium, but tend to have minimal other nutritional value. \n \nFruit is a great way to add a little bit of sweetness to lunch without the guilt. This might be a grab-and-go piece of fruit, some unsweetened applesauce, a couple of tablespoons of raisins or other dried fruit, a serving of fresh berries, or cut-up fresh fruit. \n \nLeftovers are another possibility for lunch. Keep in mind the proportion of the \u201cMy Plate\u201d image \u2013 half the meal veggies, a quarter of the meal protein, and a quarter some type of healthy starch. One-dish meals work well here \u2013 think soups, chili, stews, stir fry, or cooked whole grain dishes with veggies and a protein source. You can purposefully make larger amounts every time you make dinner so that you have some to use for lunches. \n \nSo with a little preplanning, lunch can be a friend rather than a foe in your quest for better health. \n \nPam Stuppy, MS, RD, CSSD, LD, is a registered, licensed dietitian with nutrition counseling offices in York, Maine, and Portsmouth.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Norfolk","zipCode":"02494","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Needham Heights","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WCVB.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"352601084","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"415"},"name":"WCVB.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wcvb.com","publisher":"Hearst Television, Inc."},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196471293","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://hips.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/traveler-released-at-jfk-airport-1485651543.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Mylan's chief executive, Heather Bresch, found herself following in the footsteps of another pharmaceutical executive who engaged in a massive price hike, Martin Shkreli, at a Congressional hearing last year. \n \nMylan has faced competitors before \u2014 including from the Auvi-Q before it was recalled from the market. But EpiPen's market dominance and familiarity to patients and doctors, as well as by various issues with its competitors, meant that Mylan has been able to dominate the epinephrine auto-injector space. \n \nNow, EpiPen will go head-to-head with Auvi-Q and with the authorized generic of another auto-injector called Adrenaclick. Last week, CVS Health said it would offer a two-pack of the generic version of Adrenaclick for $110. \n \nMylan is readying itself for competition; it launched an authorized generic of EpiPen late last year, at half the list price \u2014 $300 for a two-pack. \n \nThe list prices for these three products are all over the map: the Auvi-Q, which comes with a voice that talks patients through how to administer the injection, is priced at a slight premium to Mylan's generic EpiPen, which is further undercut by the CVS price for Adrenaclick's generic. \n \nBut the list price doesn't reflect what insurers pay because they negotiate secret rebates and discounts. It also doesn't reflect what patients generally pay, because insurance often passes through only part of the cost, through a co-pay or co-insurance. The growth in high deductible plans, in which patients are on the hook for the full cost of a drug until they hit a dollar limit, is thought to have helped spur public outrage about EpiPen because consumers were increasingly exposed to the escalating list price. \n \nThe three companies are offering various kinds of coupons and patient affordability programs to defray the cost to consumers even further. Those programs reveal the varied patchwork that makes drugs affordable. \n \nFor example, the Auvi-Q will be free to patients with commercial insurance \u2014 even if they have a high deductible plan, according to Kaléo. In addition to offering a $110 cash price at CVS for the Adrenaclick generic, the company Impax Laboratories is offering a $100 coupon. Mylan is offering a $25 coupon off out of pocket costs for its authorized generic. Coupons cannot be used by people with government insurance. \n \nIn a broader sense, these options will give insurers more leverage when trying to negotiate the price of the medication. Insurers and the companies they hire to negotiate on their behalf \u2014 pharmacy benefit managers \u2014 use competition and the threat of excluding a product altogether to wring deeper discounts. \n \nThe insurer Cigna announced this month that it would cover only the generic versions of EpiPen and Adrenaclick. \n \nWhat remains to be seen, however, is whether savings insurers get from the increased negotiating clout are passed on to customers through reduced copays or, ultimately, lower premiums. What the EpiPen maelstrom laid bare, in part, was the complexity of drug pricing and the fact that many middlemen industries can also benefit from high drug prices.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Carolyn Y.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2850","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Mudgee","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Mudgee Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169740483","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Mudgee Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mudgeeguardian.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196477448","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

I was mere blocks from where I'd started my walk with Otis, the beagle I was dog-sitting. That knowledge didn't matter, though; fear and adrenaline pulsed through my veins and I began to sweat profusely, which only added to the confusion in my brain. I had no idea where I was, and my surroundings looked completely unfamiliar. It was as though I'd been dropped into the middle of a foreign land. Walking in any direction would be just a guess: Am I getting closer to or farther away from where I need to be? \n \nI hadn't written down the address of the home I was staying at and thus had no way to ask directions, and cellphones and GPS navigation were yet to be invented. Fortunately, a woman who approached to greet Otis knew his owners and their house. She was kind enough to walk me back. We were only four blocks away. \n \nI was 13 when this happened, and although I knew from a much earlier age that I had more trouble than most finding my way, it was easy just to tag along and follow others. However, this experience made me realize there was something wrong with me. My life was forever changed. \n \nWhat if that woman hadn't happened by? Would I have had to knock on someone's door and ask to use their phone to call the police? What would I tell them? How could I expect them to return me to a place if I had no address or description to provide? \n \nI have developmental topographical disorientation, or DTD. This means I can't form a mental map or image of my surroundings. Unlike most people, I have no internal compass. At 61, I still get lost, and it's every bit as confounding and frightening as it was all those years ago. \n \n\"When you move around, you do so by monitoring a lot of information, you look at landmarks and you try not to bump into walls,\" says Giuseppe Iaria, an associate professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Calgary. \"There is all this processing of dynamic information. You use this to form and constantly update a cognitive map of where everything is around you.\" \n \nBrain lesions sometimes affect the orientation process, producing a condition called acquired topographical disorientation. Those of us with DTD, however, show no evidence of brain damage. \n \n\"In other words, there was no brain injury \u2014 no car accident, no brain tumor or stroke,\" says Iaria, who developed the DTD diagnosis and first wrote about it in 2009. \"They just didn't develop certain skills. We have found that these people who have this condition, in which basically they get lost every day in the most familiar surroundings, have been this way all their lives.\" \n \nThe brains of people with DTD function much differently from those of other people, Iaria says. Brain scans of resting DTD patients have shown decreased communication between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortices, both locations vital to spatial orientation. The two don't work in sync with one another, which impairs navigational abilities. Iaria says this condition may affect up to 2 percent of the population. \n \nDTD was brought to light by filmmaker Michelle Coomber in the 2010 documentary \"Lost Every Day,\" about Sharon Roseman of Denver, who was unable to find her way around her own apartment. \n \nRoseman had kept her condition a secret for years after receiving several wrong diagnoses, including multiple personality disorder. She eventually confided in her brother, who was instrumental in her contacting Iaria. She and hundreds of others have since participated in many studies, all of which concluded there had been no stroke or other kind of damage to their brains, memory or intelligence. \n \nI vividly remember having to adapt to my condition once I started driving. I would either follow a friend who was in a car ahead of me or I would ride as a passenger to parties and other functions. I was terrified if there was no one to accompany me when driving, even if only to the store a mile and a half away. Often, I wouldn't return for hours. \n \nI don't know whether I've spent more time hopelessly lost within miles of my home or trying to explain to people why I cannot follow a simple set of directions. They cannot understand how it's possible to be completely and utterly lost. \"How can you not know where you are? Don't you recognize landmarks? Don't you pay attention while you're driving? Can't you read a map?\" \n \nWhile everyone experiences being lost at times, that is significantly different from being completely disoriented in what should be very familiar surroundings. I have spent countless hours on backcountry roads not having any idea where I was; in one case, I didn't even know which state I was in. \n \nIn a hurry to contend with an emergency in Virginia, I left my home in Frederick, Maryland, at 10 p.m., heading for Alexandria, about 60 miles away. After seven long hours and with barely a drop of gas left, I began panicking, fearing I might find myself stranded on the side of the road at the mercy of whoever might stop. I found a gas station at dawn. I pulled in and had to ask what state I was in. I was in Elkins, West Virginia, nearly 200 miles west of my home and far from Alexandria. I nodded politely as I grasped the dirty receipt on which the attendant had scribbled directions to presumably get me back on track. They meant nothing. I can't follow a map or written directions. In the light of day, I managed to find my way back to the interstate, and my son met me at a rest stop near my destination to ensure I arrived safely. \n \nI factor in \"lost time\" when calculating the minutes or hours needed to reach my destination, and even now with GPS devices, I'm not secure that I'll find my way. I lose my satellite signal often and, with it, my feeling of security. Now, before I leave home, I always write down the address of my destination in case something happens to my phone and/or my GPS tool, and I always let someone know where I am going. \n \nFriends and acquaintances often laugh politely when I hesitate to meet somewhere because I may get lost. \"It's right down the road! You can't miss it: That big red house is right on the corner!\" Actually, with DTD, adding landmarks to an already confusing route makes matters only further confounding. \n \nI now offer an analogy when pressed to explain my problem: It's comparable to asking a blind person to see the color yellow. \"It's right in front of you, you can't miss it: It's bright golden yellow!\" Society readily accept blindness and understands its principles: A person cannot see no matter how bright the color. But because so little is known about DTD and because most of the population can easily navigate with their inner cognitive map, there's an \"idiot\" stigma attached to it. Those of us struggling with this disorder are often left with feelings of anxiety, depression, isolation and self-doubt, so we keep our condition to ourselves. \n \nMy children are grown young men now, and they're very patient and understanding. They fully comprehend the serious nature and complexities of my disorder and the dangers associated with it. They don't take it lightly, and they have me check in frequently when I am traveling. \n \nThere is no cure for DTD, but research is ongoing. I share my story in hopes of reaching others with DTD, especially those who have it but are unaware there's a diagnosis. I find comfort that there is a medical term and diagnosis for my condition and that it's the focus of much-needed research. With awareness, we can break free from feelings of isolation, anxiety, self-doubt and depression. \n \nFor now, I will continue to navigate the roads much the same way I navigate life: Keep it simple and straightforward, and always have a backup plan","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Mary McLaurine Speical to The Washington Post"},"topics":[],"title":"Rare neurological disorder prevents people from knowing where they are","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle","Health"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196478561","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Age should not be a criteria for deciding what the situation needs. There are people who are inactive even when young. Ultimate test is your intent.  The party demands only managers. They don't need time-tested leaders and workers like me.  I toured the state during the last elections and nobody thought I was old. Suddenly, they have discovered that I am old and need rest. I felt the Congress did not need me.  This is a time to do some introspection. I took this decision (resigning from the Congress) just a day before. I did not consult anyone but my wife.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"SM Krishna hits out at Congress, says party wants managers not mass leaders like him","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"India Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668153","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"249"},"name":"India Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indiatoday.intoday.in","publisher":"Living Media India Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196481025","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:33Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They\u2019re co-ordinating with private attorneys and firms that have volunteered to help. They\u2019re reviewing statutes, setting priorities and seeking donations. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all-out war,\u201d said Vermont Law School Professor Patrick Parenteau. \u201cIf you\u2019re an environmentalist or conservationist, this is indeed a scary time.\u201d \n \nTrump\u2019s first week in office only heightened their anxieties. He moved to resume construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines that the Obama administration had halted, while signalling intentions to abandon his predecessor\u2019s fight against global warming, vastly expand oil and gas drilling on public lands and slash the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s budget. \n \nGOP lawmakers, meanwhile, introduced measures to overturn a new Interior Department rule barring coal mining companies from damaging streams and to remove some wolves from the endangered species list. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019ve wasted no time in doing bad things,\u201d said Pat Gallagher, director of the Sierra Club\u2019s 50-member legal team, which he said is likely to grow as environmentalists increasingly regard the courts as their best option, even though success there is far from certain. \n \nThe Department of Justice, which represents the federal government in environmental lawsuits, declined to comment, while the White House did not respond to emails seeking comment. Doug Ericksen, communications director for Trump\u2019s transition team at EPA, said of the environmentalists that he\u2019s \u201cnot sure what they think they\u2019re preparing for\u201d but suspects they are stoking fear of Trump as a fundraising tool. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019re more concerned about raising money than protecting the environment,\u201d Ericksen said. \n \nJim Burling, litigation director for the Pacific Legal Foundation, a non-profit property rights group that sues regulators on behalf of businesses and landowners, also contended environmental groups were exaggerating the Trump administration\u2019s threat for political and financial gain. \n \nThe government bureaucracy is entrenched, Burling said, and, \u201cwho happens to occupy the White House hasn\u2019t made that much difference.\u201d \n \nEnvironmentalists say their fears are justified by the new administration\u2019s antagonism toward government\u2019s role in keeping air and water clean and the planet from overheating. \n \nDonations began increasing after Trump\u2019s election, \u201ceven before the fundraising letters were sent\u201d asking for support to fight the administration\u2019s actions, said David Goldston, government affairs director at the Natural Resources Defence Council. \n \nEarthjustice, which has represented the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in its fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline, has about 100 staff attorneys and plans to bring more aboard, said Tim Preso, who manages the group\u2019s Northern Rockies office. \n \nThe Chicago-based Environmental Law & Policy Center is adding four attorneys to its pre-election staff of 18 and is co-ordinating with more than a dozen outside attorneys who would file citizen suits against polluters for free if agencies fail to enforce existing rules, said Executive Director Howard Learner. \n \n\u201cWe cannot fully substitute and replace the EPA doing its job,\u201d Learner said. \u201cBut on the other hand, we\u2019re not going to default to zero if the EPA steps backward when it comes to clean air and clean water enforcement.\u201d \n \nOn inauguration eve, five law professors filed a brief in support of a 2015 regulation giving EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers discretion to regulate tributaries and wetlands far upstream from navigable lakes and rivers to protect water quality. \n \nDozens of states have sued to block the rule \u2014 including Oklahoma, led by state Attorney General Scott Pruitt, now Trump\u2019s choice for EPA administrator \u2014 saying it gives government too much power over private property. \n \nShortly after Trump took office, his White House webpage listed the rule among \u201charmful and unnecessary policies\u201d he would target. \n \n\u201cIf the Trump administration won\u2019t defend the rule, I want to stand alongside environmental groups and do what I can to defend (it),\u201d said David Uhlmann, a University of Michigan law professor and former Justice Department prosecutor, who helped file the brief. \n \nGoing to court is just one tactic environmental lawyers will use, said Erik Schlenker-Goodrich of the Oregon-based Western Environmental Law Center, which also plans new hires. They will monitor agencies for failure to enforce pollution law or cutting corners when writing permits for activities such as oil and gas drilling, he said. \n \nThe Sierra Club\u2019s Gallagher, who sued over oil drilling beneath national parks during the George W. Bush administration, said another tactic would be making liberal use of open-records laws to obtain scientific data and other materials that might otherwise be purged. The group already has requested records on climate change from the EPA. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised at what they\u2019re doing, but maybe a little surprised at how fast and furious it\u2019s all happening,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cBut we were bracing for it and we\u2019re ready.\u201d \n \n___ \n \nFlesher reported from Traverse City, Michigan. \n \n___ \n \nFollow Webber and Flesher on Twitter: https://twitter.com/twebber02, https://twitter.com/JohnFlesher","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Environment news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Environmentalists preparing to battle Trump, GOP in court","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"V5Z","state":"British Columbia","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Vancouver","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"News 1130","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657971","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"475"},"name":"News 1130","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Global","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news1130.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/twebber02","https://twitter.com/JohnFlesher"],"sequenceId":"695196482513","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

woman in the Hunter has global vision for region. \n\nTHE state government\u2019s fresh face in the Hunter has declared she wants to end Novocastrian \u201cnegativity\u201d, vowing to be the \u201cbest friend\u201d of anyone who wants to sell the region\u2019s story on the world stage.\n\nIn a running start to her new job, incoming Parliamentary Secretary for the Hunter Catherine Cusack also said outstanding council amalgamations were a \u201chandbrake\u201d on the region\u2019s growth; the Williamtown contamination crisis needed \u201curgent attention\u201d from the federal government; and Newcastle\u2019s \u201crebellious spirit\u201d demanded respect.\n\nMs Cusack will become NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s highest representative in the Hunter, replacing Scot MacDonald who shifts to Parliamentary Secretary for Planning and the Central Coast.\n\nIn a cabinet reshuffle announced on Sunday, several former Baird Government heavy-hitters were dumped, including Adrian Piccoli, who had education, and Duncan Gay, who had the roads portfolio.\n\nMr Piccoli was replaced in education by Pittwater MP Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by Lane Cove MP and former energy minister Anthony Roberts. \n\nAndrew Constance will continue to oversee the Newcastle light rail project as transport minister.\n\nMs Cusack said she was \u201cso excited\u201d for her new role, and indulged that she had already come to know the region through her mentor, firebrand former education minister, the late Virginia Chadwick, who was born in Newcastle.\n\n\u201cShe always felt that Newcastle had enormous potential that needed to be released,\u201d Ms Cusack said. \u201cIt\u2019s a world-class city that can stand on its own two feet.\u201d\n\nMr MacDonald, who used a crying emoji on Twitter after the announcement, said he was \u201csorry\u201d to lose responsibility for the Hunter.\n\n\u201cIt has been the most challenging and exciting role of my political career,\u201d he said.\n\nMs Cusack, who is based in Lennox Head, said she would promote the government\u2019s urban renewal projects in the Hunter to the world.\n\n\u201cThe question shouldn\u2019t be what do I see as the Hunter\u2019s role in the state \u2013 it should be what is the Hunter\u2019s role in the world?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be the best friend of anyone who promotes that positive message.\u201d\n\nDeclaring the region demanded respect from its politicians, she said pending Hunter council mergers needed to be decided. \n\n\u201cThe sooner that\u2019s resolved, the better,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Cusack said to have large swathes of the Hunter in \u201cuproar\u201d over the Williamtown contamination crisis was a disgrace. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m dying to get to the bottom of that issue,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Cusack, who planned to visit the region this week, would not elaborate on what federal government assistance was required until she met with residents.\n\nOpposition Leader Luke Foley criticised the pick and said the Hunter had again been \u201coverlooked\u201d for ministerial status. \n\n\u201c[Ms Berejiklian] saw fit to add in any number of spurious new ministries to ensure that every boy and girl in the Liberal Party room got a prize but clearly appointing a minister for the Hunter wasn't a priority,\u201d Mr Foley said. \n\nMeanwhile, Mr MacDonald talked up the Hunter\u2019s economic credentials.\n\n\u200b\u201cit\u2019s a huge region that comes with a lot of responsibilities,\u201d Mr MacDonald said. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that if the Hunter\u2019s performing well, the rest of the state is performing well.\u201d\n\nThe MP was in the role while the government made a number of contentious decisions, including the truncation of the heavy rail line and light rail down Hunter Street. \n\nMr MacDonald\u2019s advice for Ms Cusack was to press the flesh with as many people in the Hunter as possible. \n\nAnd in a parting jab at his political rivals, he challenged Hunter Labor MPs to stop being \u201cprotest representatives\u201d. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to oppose something without coming up with solutions of your own,\u201d he said. \n\nPort Stephens MP Kate Washington said she hoped Ms Cusack was \u201cbetter\u201d than Mr MacDonald.\n\n\u201dAs Shadow Minister for the Hunter and the Member for Port Stephens, I look forward to working with Catherine and trust that she will be willing to engage with the local Hunter MP's, unlike her predecessor,\u201d she said.\n\nThe new cabinet will be sworn in on Monday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Brodie Owen@Brodie_Owen"},"topics":[{"name":"Australia

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2300","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Newcastle","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Newcastle Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666508","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"107"},"name":"Newcastle Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theherald.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196485530","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

They're mentally tough as well. They always kept going. \n\n\"It's something that I learned from them a lot, is how to hopefully do the same, which hopefully I've been able to do.\" \n\nWilliams had been reluctant to talk about records in Melbourne to keep the pressure off, but she is now ready to acknowledge her standing as one of the greatest women players of all time, if not the greatest. \n\n\"I definitely think so. I mean, between Martina, myself, Steffi Graf, hands down we are leading that conversation,\" she said. \n\nHer achievement took 19 long years from her Grand Slam debut as a 17-year-old in Melbourne in 1998, and she is not ready to stop just yet. \n\nBut she insists there are no new goals, despite Court's 24 titles being within reach. \n\n\"I never had a number. That's the beauty of it,\" she said. \n\n\"When I started this journey, I just wanted to win a Grand Slam. Then I just wanted to win. Every time I step on the court, I want to win.\" \n\nAnd in an ominous sign that there is still more to come, she added: \"I don't want it to stop. I want to keep it going.\" \n\n- Enjoy the moment - \n\nBeing at the top for so long means Williams now carefully selects her tournaments, and she is set to take a break now until Indian Wells in early March. \n\nShe said she wanted to enjoy winning in Australia, and give it time to sink in. \n\n\"One thing I learned in the past is you have to enjoy it. That's the beauty of winning Australia, you have a few months to relax,\" she said. \n\n\"If you win the French, it's like back-to-back-to-back-to-back. Australia, you have time to enjoy the moment before the next Grand Slam.\" \n\nWilliams also has wedding plans to make after her recent engagement to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who was courtside for her historic victory. \n\nShe revealed that elder sister Venus would be a bridesmaid, but not when the marriage would take place nor where. \n\nBut she said it was special having Ohanian by her side in Melbourne. \n\n\"He's been so supportive in the stands. Although I never really heard him, even though I heard he was very boisterous,\" she said. \n\n\"I'm so focused, I don't hear a lot. I have really selective hearing. It's nice to have that support. It is a wonderful feeling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Fighting spirit propels Serena to tennis greatness (AFP)","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Yahoo!
