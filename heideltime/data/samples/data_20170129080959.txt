Devin Booker added 23. \n \nDenver won despite the absence of center Nikola Jokic, who left with a left hip flexor strain late in Thursday night\u2019s 127-120 victory. \n \nThe Nuggets were in the penalty situation with 8:19 still to play in the third quarter. \n \n\u201cWe went to the bonus really early,'\u201d Gallinari said, \u201cso we had to take advantage of that and give ourselves a chance to get to the free throw line.\u201d \n \nThey certainly did. \n \nBledsoe didn\u2019t have much to say about the Nuggets\u2019 foul-line parade. \n \n\u201cAsk the refs,\u201d he said. \n \nThe Suns, not surprisingly, were in foul trouble in the quarter. Starting forwards T.J. Warren and Marquese Chriss had five apiece and Booker four. Denver finished the game 37 of 42 at the line. \n \n\u201cThey do a great job just attacking the rim, attacking the paint, putting themselves in bonus situations,\u201d Suns coach Earl Watson said. \u201cSame thing happened in the second (quarter) in the game in Denver. The last few games versus them, they shot 70 free throws.\u201d \n \nPhoenix went to the line more than a few times, too. The Suns were 24 of 32, led by Bledsoe\u2019s 14 of 15. \n \nJameer Nelson added 17 points for the Nuggets and Gary Harris 15. \n \nDenver outscored the Suns 36-22 in the third quarter and was up 95-76 when Wilson Chandler scored inside with 1:02 to play. The Suns scored the final seven points of the period to cut Denver\u2019s lead to 95-83 entering the fourth. \n \nBut Phoenix never got closer than seven in the final 12 minutes. \n \n\u201cWe played defense,\u201d Faried said. \u201cWe got back into it, got to the free throw line, we got back in transition. They were getting a lot of open shots and we isolated them and tried to make them take tough shots.\u201d \n \nEarly, the Suns were off and running. \n \nThey used a 19-3 first-quarter run to go up 29-13 on Brandon Knight\u2019s 10-foot floater. The first quarter ended with Phoenix up 33-21 and the Nuggets shooting 33 percent (7 for 21). \n \nBut Denver got it going in the second, outscoring the Suns 15-5 to tie it at 44 when Gallinari converted a three-point play with five minutes left in the half. Denver never quite caught the Suns the rest of the half. Bledsoe\u2019s two free throws with 7.6 seconds to play put Phoenix up 61-59 lead at the break. \n NOT HIS KNIGHT  \nKnight struggled through a 1-for-8 shooting night and his team\u2019s point differential was a staggering minus-32 when he was on the floor. \n TIP-INS  \nBledsoe\u2019s previous career high was 40 set in Toronto on Jan. 22.. \u2026 Booker scored at least 20 for the 12th straight game, the first player to do so in his first or second season since Blake Griffin did it 14 in a row in 2010-11. \u2026 Phoenix was without rookie Dragan Bender for the third straight game with right ankle soreness. \n UP NEXT  \nPhoenix is home against Memphis on Monday night.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Phoenix Suns news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Denver Nuggets news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Bledsoe scores 41 but Nuggets beat Suns again","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bartholomew","zipCode":"47203","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Columbus","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"1010 WCSI","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"541446766","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"1010 WCSI","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://1010wcsi.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201578261","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Bjork would later add an assist on the second goal from Andrew Oglevie, who tallied his 13th and 14th goals of the season during the opening two periods Saturday against Boston College (17-9-2, 12-3-1 HEA). \n \nFelix Holmberg also cashed in his first career goal from Jake Evans and Jordan Gross at 6:35 of the second period to give the Irish a 3-2 lead. \n \nAfter falling behind 4-2 midway through the second period, Boston College would score the game's final four goals. Chris Calnan, who picked up the first Eagles goal in the opening period to tie the game at 1-1, would add the game-winner at 15:59 of the third stanza. \n \nHOW IT HAPPENED \n \nJust 1:04 into the first period, Anders Bjork staked the Irish to a 1-0 lead. Tory Dello took a pass at the point from Dennis Gilbert and fired the puck on goal. Joseph Woll kicked out the rebound to the slot, where Bjork chipped in his 16th of the season. \n \nJust under four minutes later, Boston College's Chris Calnan tied the game at 1-1. \n \nBut the Irish responded 1:12 later when Andrew Oglevie sent a spinning backhander low past Woll for his 13th of the season. Gilbert earned his second assist of the night on the play, while Jake Evans had the other assist. \n \nBC tied the game at 2-2 off the stick of Chris Brown at 4:48 of the second period. Felix Holmberg's first career goal would follow, as Holmberg knocked home an Evans shot on goal that Woll turned aside at 6:35. Oglevie would score his second of the night, shorthanded, from Bjork and Jordan Gross at 8:36 for the 4-2 Notre Dame advantage. \n \nColin White would answer for Boston College later in the second period, tallying his 12th of the season from Matthew Gaudreau and JD Dudek. White's goal trimmed the Notre Dame lead to 4-3 at 15:20. \n \nWith two minutes remaining in the second, Cal Petersen came up with a big stop, denying Calnan. Then just over a minute later the junior netminder stoned Ryan Fitzgerald's breakaway chance to keep the Irish in front heading to the third period. \n \nJust 1:59 into the third period, Julius Mattila tied the game, 4-4, with a quick snapshot from the low slot. \n \nThe teams continued to have chances at both ends, including back-to-back scoring opportunities by Dawson Cook and Jack Jenkins midway through the period that Woll turned aside. \n \nBoston College took its first lead of the game with just over four minutes remaining in the third period. Calnan notched his second of the night and fifth goal of the season to put the Eagles ahead 5-4 at 15:59. \n \nPetersen made another breakaway save to deny Fitzgerald shorthanded with 2:10 to play, and an elbowing call on White with a little over 90 seconds remaining gave the Irish a power play pushing for the tying goal. \n \nThe rally was not to be, as Fitzgerald buried an empty net goal to send Boston College to the 6-4 win. \n \nCOACH JACKSON'S THOUGHTS \n \nOn the game in general ... \n\"I thought we played a pretty good hockey game but we were our own worst enemy sometimes with some of the mistakes we made with the puck. That plays right into BC's hands, they're a good transition team.\" \n \nOn the pace of the game and breakaway chances throughout ... \n\"Our games with BC are always a little chaotic. They are usually a little bit more in control than that.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 41 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"40202","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Louisville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Louisville Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"540"},"name":"Louisville Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201586098","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Seven days later, norms and doctrine that have guided the United States for decades are being re-examined. \n\nTrump\u2019s down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address: a call to arms that tested old distinctions between left and right. \n\n\u201cToday, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cWe are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.\u201d \n\nThe establishment \u201celites\u201d in big cities, in politics and the media were no longer the technocrats in charge of the world\u2019s only superpower, they were the enemy. \n\nThe new president also put the rest of the world on notice. \n\nFor the last 75 years, America had been what Barack Obama described as the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d \u2014 the glue that bound the global order. \n\nThe era of Trump would be the era of \u201cAmerica first,\u201d he said, of naked self-interest and zero-sum diplomacy. Old alliances would be reassessed, new alliances would be explored. \n\nBefore his inauguration, many asked if the presidency would change Donald Trump, or whether Donald Trump would change the presidency. \n\nBarely 20 minutes into his four-year term, anyone who was listening had their answer. \n\n\u2013 Rolling thunder \u2013 \n\nBefore arriving at the Oval Office, Trump\u2019s strategists had decided to use the first few weeks to unleash a daily wave of executive orders. \n\nThe aim was to unbalance opponents, define Trump as a man of action and slake his supporters\u2019 thirst for change. \n\nFor much of middle America, globalization, automation and the Great Recession had been apocalyptic. \n\nPolitics had passed them over and worse, they felt steamrollered by \u201ccoastal elites\u201d in America\u2019s \u201cculture wars\u201d over abortion, gay rights, immigration, global warming and religion. \n\nTrump had won the election by promising to be their champion, and he was going to \u2014 as Ronald Reagan said \u2014 \u201cdance with the one that brung ya.\u201d \n\nFor the most part, the CEO-in-chief put forward actions that could have come from any Republican in the country: defunding abortion, preening the military and approving oil pipelines. \n\nBut it was coated with a thick veneer of nationalist and populist rhetoric, and accompanying policies championed by top aide Steve Bannon. \n\nTrump ripped up a trans-Pacific trade deal designed to counterbalance China\u2019s regional economic power, imposed a ban on refugees from Syria and migrants from seven other Muslim countries. \n\nHe ordered planning to begin to build a wall on Mexico\u2019s southern border and picked a very public fight with Mexico\u2019s president Enrique Pena Nieto, who cancelled a trip to Washington. \n\nThe United States, a nation founded by migrants, was now willing to shut its doors. \n\nNot since Obama\u2019s election or perhaps the Iraq War has America\u2019s image around the world changed so dramatically and so quickly. \n\nBut Trump supporters saw an outsider sticking up for them and sticking it to the elites. \n\n\u201cGet used to it,\u201d said Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, boasting that Trump had delivered a \u201cshock to the system.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s just getting started,\u201d she said. \n\n\u2013 Rocky start \u2013 \n\nBut it was not all positive for Trump. The White House is far from purring. Key positions have yet to be filled and the decision making process is haphazard. \n\nTrump aides were forced to publicly row back suggestions of a 20 percent border tax on Mexican goods and defend a chaotic rollout of the refugee and migrant ban. \n\nThroughout the week, Trump engaged in intemperate outbursts about the size of his inaugural crowd, alleged election fraud and perceived media persecution. \n\nPrivately, in call after call, he complained to top aides about press coverage. The impression was of a man focused on his image more than running the country. \n\nTrump also seemed like a a man for whom becoming US president was not adulation enough. \n\nSpokesman Sean Spicer \u2014 between tirades and missteps \u2014 offered a window onto the soul of the White House. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this constant theme to undercut the enormous support he has,\u201d Spicer said. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably frustrating when you\u2019re continually told it\u2019s not big enough; it\u2019s not good enough. You can\u2019t win.\u201d \n\nBut critics saw a more sinister motive for the outbursts, particularly Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that three million people voted illegally in the election. \n\nBrian Klaas, an expert on global democracy at the London School of Economics, sees Trump \u201ccasting aspersions (without evidence) on electoral integrity is a key way to restrict voting rights and erode confidence in elections.\u201d \n\n\u201cAttacking the media and blurring the lines of truth with state narratives not grounded in fact is important to sowing public doubt,\u201d he said. \n\nMindy Finn, who ran as a independent vice presidential candidate, summed up Trump\u2019s strategy as \u201csow chaos, deepen division and consolidate power.\u201d \n\nFor his harshest critics, the question is now whether Donald Trump breaks the presidency, or whether the presidency breaks Donald Trump. \n\n© 2017 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrew BEATTY"},"topics":[],"title":"In one week, Trump shakes up Washington and the world","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Ladysmith Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"533463025","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"547"},"name":"Ladysmith Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://ladysmithgazette.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201586457","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He was quite social on his table that he was sitting at apparently. I think he was just very glad of that and the other few occasions when we would invite him to family parties,\u201d Mr Dias said. \n\nMr Dias said they were neighbours from the 1980s until Mr Lytton moved to Pakistan in 2005, without warning. \n\nNeighbours say he was a tube driver, and at one stage perhaps worked as a taxi driver and even a casino croupier. \n\nMr Lytton was found on the morning of 12 December 2015, fully clothed and facing the summit of Indian\u2019s Head, a prominent feature above Dovestone Reservoir on Saddleworth Moor in the Peak District. \n\nPolice discovered he had travelled to the UK from Lahore, Pakistan, two days before his death. \n\nThree train tickets and £130 in cash were found on his body, but he had no wallet, ID or phone. \n\nOn the day before his body was found, he was seen on CCTV pacing outside London\u2019s Ealing Broadway station. He was later seen at London\u2019s Euston station. \n\nHe then travelled by train from London to Manchester, where he entered a pub in Greenfield and asked for directions to the 1,500ft summit. \n\nHe had been warned not to attempt the walk so late in the day but set off anyway. Witnesses saw him on the track at dusk that evening. \n\nFollowing his death, toxicology reports showed Mr Lytton had been killed by strychnine, which is found in rat poison. Police say he poisoned himself. \n\nNumerous theories about his identity were raised as the police investigation continued. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until a leg implant was traced back to Lahore where the surgery had been carried out and his identity was discovered. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found the whole thing very sad,\u201d Mr Dias said. \u201cI think he was a very lonely person with only a few regular visitors. When he left we have no recollection of him saying goodbye to us. I would go as far to use the word recluse.

Are they still planning to kill Dhlakama?\u201d asked the 64-year-old rebel, who often speaks about himself in the third person. \n\n\u201cAre they trying to find the river where Dhlakama is drinking from to poison it, or the roads we use to plant anti-personnel landmines?\u201d \n\nDhlakama, whose Renamo party is the main opposition in Mozambique, retreated in October 2012 to his hideout in Gorongosa with 800 former guerrillas demanding a greater share of power. \n\nIn 2013 tensions resurfaced with Renamo fighters again taking up arms against Frelimo, accusing the ruling party of enriching itself at the expense of the southern African country. \n\nOn the eve of the October 2014 general elections Renamo and the government signed a ceasefire. \n\nBut Renamo refused to accept the results of the 2014 elections when it was beaten once more at the polls by Frelimo, which has been in power since the former Portuguese colony\u2019s independence 40 years ago \n\n\u2013 \u2018Won\u2019t give up on truce\u2019 \u2013 \n\nDhlakama has accused the army of not only targeting Renamo members but civilians too. \n\n\u201cThe armed forces go to the villages, open fire to disperse the population, and then ransack the houses making off with chickens and goats, which is typical of Frelimo,\u201d he claimed, adding that women had been beaten and houses torched. \n\n\u201cEither Frelimo does not know how to control its troops or there is a clear lack of will,\u201d he said. \n\nAbuses have also been reported to international organisations by Mozambicans who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries. \n\nAuthorities in December said more than 3,000 people fleeing the conflict now live in government camps, while the UN refugee agency says another 8,600 have been forced to cross the border to Malawi and Zimbabwe. \n\nIn spite of the allegations, Dhlakama has no intention of calling off the ceasefire, which he admits he unilaterally proclaimed in a bid to reopen peace negotiations. \n\nThe peace talks with international mediators resumed in May last year but failed to prevent the escalation of tensions and by mid-December the mediators quit the country. \n\n\u201cI must speak to President Nyusi in the coming days because we are still waiting for him to give the signal for the return of mediators,\u201d said Dhlakama. \n\nThe rebel leader said he will leave his mountain base only to sign a peace agreement. \n\n\u201cWe are not going to give up on the truce. But every day someone calls me up to ask me to extend it beyond March 4.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 43 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lancaster","zipCode":"17603","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169674001","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"WGAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201606821","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(Photo by AFP) \n \nFloods in Peru have killed 11 people and displaced more than 11,000 families in recent weeks. \n \nOn Friday, the Peruvian government declared a state of emergency in four regions, where torrential rains, landslides, and floods have led to road blockages, the destruction of crops as well as buildings and bridges. \n \n\u201cThe cabinet is on permanent alert for climate issues,\u201d said Peruvian Prime Minister Fernando Zavala. \u201cIt is important to note that local emergency centers and regional and local governments are already deploying and working, independent of cabinet ministers.\u201d \n \nAuthorities have appealed for calm and urged people to have confidence in the government. \n \nAccording to the National Civil Defense Institute, three people drowned as their car was caught in floodwaters in Arequipa region, south of Peru. Eight others have been killed by the waters in other regions. \n \nIntense rainfall in recent days has caused the Ica River to overflow, affecting residents in the districts of Tinguina and Parcona. Water covered several blocks in the city, reaching 70 centimeters in height. Streets were completely flooded while residents rushed to salvage their belongings. Others abandoned their homes and moved to safer areas.

Great success. Great idea.\u201d \n \nMexico\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \u201cprofound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister\u2019s message on Twitter\u201d to Israel\u2019s ambassador. \u201cMexico is Israel\u2019s friend and should be treated as such.\u201d \n \n12:20 a.m. \n \nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \u201cis not a Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it\u2019s \u201cworking out very nicely.\u201d \n \nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n \nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n \n12:10 a.m. \n \nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration order. \n \nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n \nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn\u2019t proceed on flights to the U.S. \n \nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn\u2019t complete their trips. \n \nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n \n11:50 p.m. \n \nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country\u2019s decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n \nZarif says on Twitter: \u201cUnlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\u201d \n \nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n \n11:20 p.m. \n \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n \nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \u201cTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\u201d \n \nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto\u2019s airport. \n \nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n \nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n \nMore than 75 percent of Canada\u2019s exports are to the U.S. \n \n10:20 p.m. \n \nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \u201cthe land of freedom\u201d after being released from custody. \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n \nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n \nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n \nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\u201d \n \n9:50 p.m. \n \nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States\u2019 new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n \n\u201cI am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\u201d said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n \nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n \n\u201cHis intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\u201d said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \u201cBut you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\u201d \n \n8:30 p.m. \n \nIran\u2019s foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n \nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \u201ccounteraction\u201d to Trump\u2019s executive order. \n \nThe statement says: \u201cIran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\u201d \n \nThe statement adds: \u201cIt will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\u201d \n \nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n \n8 p.m. \n \nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n \nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq\u2019s Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n \nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n \nThe officials said Saturday\u2019s action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n \nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n \n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n \n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n \n7:05 p.m. \n \nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n \nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM\u2019s press office, said: \u201cWe would love to bring them there. That\u2019s not the problem. It\u2019s just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\u201d \n \nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nTrump signed the order Friday. \n \n6:40 p.m. \n \nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n \nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n \nThe official says there\u2019s an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it\u2019s unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n \nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n \nThe official wasn\u2019t authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump\u2019s order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n \nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n \n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n \n6:35 p.m. \n \nIsrael\u2019s leader has endorsed President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel\u2019s wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n \n\u201cPresident Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel\u2019s southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\u201d he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n \nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n \nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n \n5:45 p.m. \n \nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls\u2019 education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n \nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria\u2019s civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n \nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \u201cnot to turn his back on the world\u2019s most defenseless children and families.\u201d \n \nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \u201chelped build your country.\u201d \n \nTrump\u2019s mother was born in Scotland. \n \n5:15 p.m. \n \nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n \nA statement on the company\u2019s website says: \u201cNationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\u201d \n \nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n \nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n \n3 p.m. \n \nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy Airport. \n \nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n \nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n \n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n \n2:45 p.m. \n \nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n \nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump\u2019s decision \u201cwill not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\u201d \n \nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won\u2019t harm national security. \n \nEgeland says the decision dealt a \u201cmortal blow\u201d to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution.

Hashmi said authorities have told him it was too early to speculate. \n \n\u201cNone whatsoever right now,\u201d the center director said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any lead or information as to what started the fire and what happened. So I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be a few days, they told us, before they can come up with any answers for us.\u201d \n \nThe congregation\u2019s pastor, known as an imam, was awake in the early morning hours and checked online surveillance of the mosque and found no alarm active and the doors unlocked, Hashmi said. On Jan. 21, someone broke in and stole some electronics, including laptops. \n \n\u201cHe was worried about it and drove over there,\u201d Hashmi said. \u201cBy that time, fire engines were already there pouring water on the fire.\u201d \n \nThe structure was built in 2000. \n \nNo injuries were reported. It took about four hours to extinguish the blaze. \n \nHashmi, who\u2019s lived in Victoria 32 years, said the congregation of about 140 has had few other problems and has enjoyed support from the city of about 115 miles southwest of Houston. He already has received offers of temporary quarters for the congregation to worship. \n \n\u201cWhen 9/11 happened, Muslims and non-Muslims, we all got together,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, we will rebuild.\u201d \n \nThe Victoria Advocate on Saturday reported that in July 2013, a man admitted to painting \u201cH8,\u201d a computer shorthand for \u201chate,\u201d on the outside of the building. \n \nOn Jan. 7, a mosque under construction near Lake Travis in Austin was burned to the ground. \n \nThe Texas office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said like that blaze, it would monitor the investigation of the Victoria fire. \n \n\u201cBecause of growing anti-Muslim bigotry in our nation, and because of the recent spike in hate incidents targeting Islamic institutions and individuals, we urge investigators to keep the possibility of a bias motive for this fire in mind,\u201d CAIR-Houston Executive Director Mustafaa Carroll said. \n \nThere\u2019s been no determination yet for the Austin blaze, Diane Kanawati, with CAIR-Austin, said Saturday. \n \nIn December, a man was sentenced to four years in prison for setting fire to a Houston mosque where he worshipped. Gary Nathaniel Moore pleaded guilty to arson and using a fire as a deadly weapon in a Dec. 25, 2015, blaze that caused significant damage at the Islamic Society of Greater Houston mosque.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Austin news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"US: Texas mosque goes up in flames hours after Trumpâs Muslim ban","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Deccan Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673440","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"137"},"name":"Deccan Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201613923","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In reality, you have to rely on your own ability, knowing what to consider and how to balance the variables. \n\nEvery critical poker decision begins by taking into consideration past patterns, present conditions and the likelihood of future behaviors both in the current hand and over the course of play. A player has to weigh the strength of these variables, with \"feel\" and analysis working together. \n\nWith practice, this gets easier. \n\nI've been working closely with one of my favorite students, Donald, who came to me a far greater fan of consistency than creativity. Mastering what and how to think would require each of these attributes, and after a few hundred hands, he may have gotten a taste. \n\nDonald was sitting with $1,200 at a $2-$5 no-limit cash game at Bellagio. He woke up with red kings in middle position and raised to $20. Action folded to the small blind, who thought for a long time before calling, which suggested that he was considering a raise. That's excellent information to have moving forward in a hand. \n\nThe flop came Ac 9h 6d. The small blind checked. Old Donald would have applied a broad-stroke play and made a continuation bet. Alex-coached New Donald thought it through: If he was ahead, he'd earn no money by betting because of the ace. If he was behind, he'd be throwing money away by betting. \n\nIf he checked and was behind, he'd save his money and still have a chance for a miracle. If he was ahead, how much did he risk by checking? There were likely two outs for his opponent at best. Checking would also make Donald look weak, providing an opportunity for a bluff. \n\nDonald checked. \n\nThe turn came 4h, and Donald's opponent bet $30. Donald considered the intention: \"Why would an ace bet so much if I look weak?\" Donald committed to the likelihood that his check trapped his opponent into bluffing. He called, because raising would likely prompt a fold. \n\nThe river was the 10c. The opponent checked. There was no reason for Donald to assume a trap, as Donald hadn't been aggressive post-flop. Value time. Donald wanted his opponent to call light, which meant Donald had to appear weak. Betting too small on the river would give the appearance of strength, so Donald bet $60 into a $105 pot. \n\nThe opponent called and turned up Js Jc. Donald won, extracting maximum value. \n\nDonald considered his past pattern of always continuation-betting the flop. He adjusted. He accounted for the likelihood of what his opponent might do based on whether Donald checked or bet. When the opponent revealed more and more information about his hand range, Donald adjusted each time, accounting for the past, present and future with his decisions. \n\nWhen your process truly accounts for past, present and future considerations, and you manage them effectively, you can create exploitable scenarios.

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

The note read \u201cYou will get this if you continue to attack the German Nazi Party.\u201d  (Al Amy/New York Daily News)  \nLaGuardia, mayor from 1934 to 1945, is remembered for many things, from steering New York out of the Depression to his comic readings of the Sunday funny pages during a newspaper strike. \n \nBut he played another role whose gravity has been largely forgotten: With Congress and President Franklin Roosevelt gagged by their own look-away policies, LaGuardia was the rare American politician willing to call Adolf Hitler the fascist that he was. \n \nAnd it drove the uber-Nazi nuts. \n \nLaGuardia\u2019s mother, Irene Coen, was born into a prestigious Jewish family in Croatia near Trieste, Italy. The mayor became Germany\u2019s proxy punching bag for American Jews. And LaGuardia counterpunched the Fuhrer with the sting of Joe Louis. \n \nWhen Germany demanded more protection at its New York Consulate, for example, LaGuardia assigned an all-Jewish special police detail, led by Capt. Max Finkelstein, president of the Shomrin Society, the NYPD society of Jewish cops. \n Employees gather in front of Orchard St. store, one of many in district which were closed till noon on Nov. 20 in the 1930s as Jewish people protest against Nazi terror.

India alone reported 1,27,326 new cases, accounting for 60% of new cases globally. \n \nIndia is among the 22 countries considered as having a \u201chigh burden for leprosy\u201d along with high transmission by WHO. \u201cDespite being eliminated globally as a public health problem in 2000, leprosy continues to mar the lives of individuals, and impacts families and communities. \n \nThough present numbers are a fraction of what was reported a decade ago, they are unacceptable, as an effective treatment for leprosy \u2014 multidrug therapy, or MDT \u2014 has been available since the 1980s and can fully cure leprosy, comments an expert. \n \nThe number of new cases indicates the degree of continued transmission of infection.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Zee Media Bureau"},"topics":[],"title":"World Leprosy Day 2017: Why we need to step up the fight against this health issue?","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"ZeeNews.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657937","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3967"},"name":"ZeeNews.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.zeenews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://zeenews.india.com/health/worlds-first-made-in-india-leprosy-vaccine-out-on-pilot-basis-1925325","http://zeenews.india.com/tags/world-health-organisation.html"],"sequenceId":"695201638125","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:06:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Step back!\" the agents shouted at them.\n\nA few minutes later, Heidi Nassauer, chief of passenger operations for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the airport, was called over.\n\nRepresentatives Jerrold Nadler and Nydia Velazquez, both Democrats from New York, wanted clarification on whether an immigration ban issued on Friday by President Donald Trump prevented the Iraqis from consulting with attorneys.\n\nNassauer had no clear answer.\n\n\"We are as much in the dark as everybody else,\" said the border protection official at one of the largest US airports.\n\nThe tense exchange, witnessed by Reuters, was representative of the confusion at airports across the United States and others overseas after Trump abruptly halted immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries and temporarily put a stop to the entry of refugees.\n\nThroughout much of Saturday, government officials and security workers were left to guess who from those countries could enter the United States legally and who could not.\n\nThe day ended with a federal judge issuing an emergency stay that temporarily allowed stranded travelers with valid visas to remain in the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the stay, said it would help 100 to 200 people with visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at US airports.\n\nReckless\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the Trump administration said it would have been \"reckless\" to brief government agencies and airports more broadly in advance of launching the security measures, which it says are aimed at preventing attacks from foreign groups.\n\nBut career officials in the Homeland Security and State departments told Reuters the administration failed to appreciate the complexity of enforcing the order consistently or the need to prepare agencies and airlines.\n\nAffected travellers had varying experiences at different airports, according to nearly 200 accounts gathered by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA).\n\nMany holding visas told the association they were allowed into the country without a problem despite Trump's executive order banning them.\n\nBut some lawful permanent residents \u2013 those with so-called green cards \u2013 were turned away despite guidance to airlines from the CBP that they should be allowed to travel.\n\nAt about 10 pm on Friday in Seattle, some eight hours after Trump signed the executive order, an Iranian with dual Canadian citizenship from Vancouver was sent back to Canada, the traveller reported to AILA. A half hour later in New York City, an Iranian arrived at JFK and entered the United States on a valid visa without any problems, according to AILA.\n\nA senior administration official said Trump's order - aimed at citizens of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - needed to be implemented urgently to protect Americans.\n\n\"There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official told reporters in a briefing. \"It would be reckless and irresponsible to ... broadcast to the entire world the exact security measures you're going to take.\"\n\nKey figures at the Department of Homeland Security were informed, the official said, declining to elaborate.\n\n\"I\u2019m not at liberty to reveal exactly who was briefed and who wasn\u2019t briefed, but everyone that needed to be briefed was briefed,\" the official said.\n\nOut of the loop\n\nAt the State Department, one of the main agencies dealing with visas and immigration, most officials first heard of the executive order on immigration through the media, according to two department officials.\n\nWhile some offices were aware an executive order was coming, there was no official communication or consultation from the White House, they said.\n\n\"Was there any inter-agency coordination or consultation? No,\u201d said one senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nImmigration enforcement is among the federal government\u2019s most complex endeavours, involving seven agencies from the US Coast Guard and CBP to the State and Justice Departments.\n\nTwo senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security said on Saturday that they had not heard of any officials in the relevant agencies - or the congressional committees and subcommittees that oversee them - who had been consulted by anyone who helped draft the president's order.\n\n\"If the result is confusion and inconsistency, the responsibility all lies at one address,\" said one of the officials, referring to the White House.\n\nThe official, like others, requested anonymity to discuss Trump's order.\n\nAnother Homeland Security official told Reuters that the White House worked on the executive orders with \u201climited department participation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been a challenge but folks are working through it,\" the official said.\n\nChaos at airports\n\nOne of the Iraqis detained at JFK was Hameed Khalid Darweesh, a 53-year-old Kurd who had worked as a US Army translator in Iraq and had been threatened there for helping the Americans.\n\nVisas for him and his family were finally issued on Jan 20, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of Darweesh and another Iraqi, who had also worked with US military. But as soon as he landed at JFK, he was detained by CBP officers and barred from contacting his attorneys.\n\nWhen his attorneys, from the International Refugee Assistance Project, asked the CBP officers whom they could contact, the agents responded, \u201cMr. President. Call Mr. Trump,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nEventually, Darweesh was allowed to leave and met the lawmakers and his lawyers, clutching his passport and weeping with joy. The other Iraqi who was detained, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was also allowed to enter the country.\n\nBut dozens of others were less fortunate.\n\nConflicting media and government reports caused confusion for airlines struggling to deal with the order.\n\nCBP informed air carriers about the executive order in a conference call late on Friday, said a person familiar with the agency's communications. CBP then sent written guidance before noon on Saturday saying that green card holders were \"not included\" in the ban and could continue to travel to the United States.

There he announced his intention launch what he called a \"great rebuilding\" of the US Armed Forces. \n\"I'm signing an executive action to begin a great rebuilding of the armed services of the United States,\" the president said in a brief ceremony that included the swearing in of the new defense secretary, James Mattis. \n \n\"We're developing a plan for new planes, new ships, new resources, and new tools for our men and women in uniform,\" Trump added, though he did not provide additional details. \n \nThe US leader said the order was signed \u201cto ensure the sacrifices of our military are supported by the actions of our government.\u201d \n \nThe document also orders new Defense Secretary James Mattis to conduct a 30-day review of the readiness of the armed forces to assess their ability to conduct the fight against the Islamic State (ISIS, Daesh) and other forms of radical Islamic terrorism along with training, equipment maintenance, munitions, modernization and infrastructure. \n \nThis 30-day review is aimed at allowing the defense secretary and the president to establish the facts and determine the necessary priorities for the rebuilding of the military. \nAccording to The Washington Post, which says it has obtained a draft of the order on Thursday, it also says it would examine how to carry out operations against unnamed \u201cnear-peer competitors,\u201d a term that US officials \":typically use to mean China and Russia, but that language is not in the final version.\" \nWithin 60 days, Mattis also must submit to Trump a plan to improve overall readiness in the military by fiscal 2019. It will focus on everything from maintenance backlogs to the availability of training ranges and manpower shortages, and the time needed to coordinate and carry out military training. \n \nThe order also calls for a review to \u201creduce commitments not directly related to the highest priority operations to make resources available for training and maintenance.\u201d \n \nTrump also called for reviews of the US military\u2019s nuclear arsenal and of ballistic missile defense, two critical defense areas which have both suffered considerably under the Obama administration. \n \nCommenting on the signed document, Russian military expert and First Vice President of the Academy of Geopolitical Studies Konstantin Sivkov told Sputnik that it underscores \"distrust in NATO,\" and the alliance's capability of ensuring the security of America. \n \n\"The measures for the build-up of power of the US armed forces have the only explanation: Trump does not trust NATO and considers it an obsolete organization. And if so, he should solve the US national security issues only at the expense of the US by building-up of strength and size of his own army, and that is what he is doing,\" the expert told Sputnik. \n \nKonstantin Sivkov also noted that this order is addressed, first and foremost, to the US establishment, which still regards Trump as \"a dark horse\" president, whose aims and ambitions still remain unclear. \n\"By addressing the Pentagon, he has made these aims clear,\" he said. \nHowever he further noted that Moscow should also make certain conclusions from the above statements of the US, leader, who, unlike his predecessor Obama, seems to pursue more decisive style of foreign policy. \n \n\"In the first days of his presidency, Trump has done more that Obama in the whole year, thus we should expect fast and very unexpected decisions from him,\" the expert said. \n \n\"Thus we should make certain conclusions and build-up our defensive potential. As, regardless of whatever is said about Trump, due to its geographic position, mentality and a number of other factors, the US remains an antagonist of Russia,\" Sivkov said. \n \nHowever at the same time he suggested that the announced rebuilding of the US Armed Forces does not mean the refusal of a compromise between Washington and Moscow, including the joint cooperation in the fight against international terrorism. \n \n\"There certainly will be a compromise between the two countries, because for Trump, it is not Moscow but international terrorism which currently remains the main enemy. And I think that the US president will master support of President Putin in the fight against it,\" the expert finally stated. \nIn a separate comment on the same issue, Russian apolitical and military analyst Alexander Perendzhiev, an associate professor in the Faculty of Political Sciences and Sociology at the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, suggested that Donald Trump has ordered to review the US military\u2019s nuclear arsenal and of ballistic missile defense to be able to further strengthen the US strategic and conventional armed forces. \nThus, he said, the US president is delivering on his electoral promises to inspect the efficiency of financing of the US Armed Forces and re-equip it with new equipment. \n \n\"Trump is laying emphasis on the strategic forces. He is going to strengthen them. And his decisions apparently should prompt Russia's military-political leadership towards preventive strengthening of Russia's potential,\" he told Sputnik. \n \nThe expert further specified what he meant: in case the US modernizes it national anti-missile defense, Russia, in turn, should modernize its strategic missiles to be able to overpower the prospective US' anti-missile defense. \n \nNever miss a story again \u2014 sign up to our Telegram channel and we'll keep you up to speed!","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Global news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Military news","group":"Society"},{"name":"International relations news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"}],"title":"'Great Rebuilding' of US Armed Forces Reflects 'Distrust in NATO'","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"RU","country":"Russia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Sputnik","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665169","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Sputnik","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://sputniknews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://telegram.me/sputniknewsint"],"sequenceId":"695201661727","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:04:22Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn3.img.sputniknews.com/images/105012/02/1050120239.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Pete Ricketts and Ken Stinson. Her donor list also includes several Omaha construction and development-related companies. \n   \nStothert said her $1.5 million fundraising total since the 2013 election exceeds her campaign\u2019s budget for the entire election. But she said she\u2019s not going to stop fundraising. \n   \n\u201cI think it shows a lot of support, and I\u2019m very grateful for the people that donated to my campaign,\u201d she said. \n   \nMello said he expects to spend about $1 million overall. \n   \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go still in this campaign, and we\u2019re working hard every single day to expand our support,\u201d he said. \n   \nOf the money he\u2019s raised, almost $190,000 was carried over from his legislative campaign committee. \n   \nMello said his support from the business community is an endorsement of his leadership style, saying donors are drawn to his consensus-building. \n   \nBut Stothert said Mello\u2019s donors are simply an indication that she\u2019s had to say no to people \u2014 even potential donors \u2014 during her four years in office. \n   \nAdkins, the political science professor, noted that there are still several months to go before the May 9 election. \n   \nMello\u2019s business support \u201cdemonstrates that there is some interest in the business community in seeing a change in the mayor,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cHow much of an interest there is, we\u2019re still going to have to see. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at the point yet where we really know that.\u201d \n   \nAdkins said donors don\u2019t like to give money to those who don\u2019t have a chance to win, so Mello\u2019s fundraising shows that donors believe he\u2019s a quality challenger. \n   \nThe fundraising totals are good for Stothert too, Adkins said. He said it\u2019s a good sign for her that she\u2019s amassed a war chest of more than $890,000. \n   \n\u201cIf an incumbent can raise a lot of money and they don\u2019t have to spend it, that\u2019s a pretty good sign,\u201d he said. \n   \nThe campaigns\u2019 2016 year-end reports are due to be made public Tuesday, but the campaigns provided their figures to The World-Herald last week. Stothert filed her report Saturday. \n   \nStothert\u2019s report includes all of her donations for the past year. \n   \nDuring 2016, Mello ended his legislative campaign committee and formed a new committee for mayoral election fundraising. \n   \nMany of Mello\u2019s top donors last year were Republican business leaders who have had high-profile clashes with Stothert. \n   \nHe received $25,000 each from Omaha Performing Arts Chairman John Gottschalk and local businessman Dana Bradford. \n   \nThere are no limits on the amount of campaign contributions in Nebraska state and local political races. \n   \nBradford, executive chairman of Waitt Brands, declined to say why he donated to Mello. \n   \nGottschalk, a former publisher of The World-Herald, said it\u2019s a contested election and he thinks Mello deserves support. \n   \n\u201cAll the money is essentially to put him in a position where he\u2019d be competitive,\u201d Gottschalk said. \n   \nHe declined to elaborate or say why he preferred Mello over Stothert. \n   \nOther big-name businessman donors to Mello include Mike Yanney, who gave $16,000 and is the co-finance chair of the campaign, and Mike Cassling, who gave $5,000. \n   \nA handful of donors gave to both, including Walter Scott, chairman emeritus of Peter Kiewit Sons\u2019 Inc., and Rod Yates and Frank Krejci, who are behind the potential redevelopment of Crossroads Mall. \n   \nIn a statement, Yanney said he decided to support Mello to bring a new leadership style to City Hall. \n   \nHe said Mello is \u201ca proven leader who has built consensus to pass balanced budgets and landmark legislation around economic development initiatives and public-private partnerships in the Nebraska Legislature.\u201d \n   \nYanney, founder and chairman emeritus of the Burlington Capital Group, had previously donated to Mello\u2019s legislative campaigns. He did not return a phone message last week. \n   \nMello said he attributes the support to \u201cour record of tackling big issues in the Legislature and helping make significant progress on economic development and public-private partnerships. That\u2019s given my candidacy much more broad appeal than people realize.\u201d \n   \nStothert, though, attributed that support to the fact that she had denied requests from many of those business leaders. \n   \nIn particular, regarding Gottschalk, Bradford, Cassling and Yanney, Stothert said she\u2019s had to make \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d and tell them no. \n   \n\u201cWhen I made those decisions it was always in the best interest of the Omaha taxpayers,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the price of leadership.\u201d \n   \nParticular disputes include: \n   \n» Gottschalk was the chairman of OPA last year when the performing arts group asked the city to acquire three buildings near the Holland Performing Arts Center. That land would go to the arts group for future expansion, and the group would turn over a nearby parking lot to HDR Inc. for the company to build a new downtown headquarters. \n   \nStothert agreed to direct the city to buy the buildings. But she declined to tear down the century-old buildings in order to make room for the expansion, which would have been unpopular with preservation groups and others. \n   \nThe arts group backed out of its request for the buildings, and the deal to bring HDR downtown eventually fell apart. The company\u2019s headquarters will be in Aksarben Village instead. \n   \n» Bradford served as the chairman of the Metropolitan Entertainment and Convention Authority, a nonprofit that oversees the city-owned CenturyLink Center and TD Ameritrade Park. Stothert was highly critical of MECA under Bradford\u2019s tenure, saying the group needed to release more information to the city about the facilities\u2019 operations. (Bradford gave Stothert\u2019s campaign $5,000 in 2013 after she took office.) \n   \n» Cassling is a former top donor to Stothert, giving her $33,000 between 2012 and 2014. He heads an initiative to bring a multisport complex to the Omaha area. The facility was initially planned to be located in Tranquility Park. That deal fell apart, at least partly, Stothert said, because the group asked for $20 million in city money. The group pulled out of Omaha and later decided to build in La Vista. Cassling, who also serves on the OPA board, did not return a phone message last week. \n   \n» Yanney\u2019s daughter, Lisa Roskens, is involved in the multisport project. Yanney and his wife, Gail, also led a campaign to raise money for what is now the Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center. As a council member, Stothert voted against a 3 percent tax on tobacco sales across the city to help fund the center, but the City Council ultimately approved the tax. \n   \nStothert said she\u2019s received donations from well-known Democrats, including developer Jay Noddle and restaurateur Willy Theisen, both MECA board members, as well as John Kotouc, executive chairman of American National Bank. \n   \nNoddle gave $10,000, according to her report, Kotouc gave $5,000, and Theisen gave $2,500. \n   \nShe also received a $2,500 contribution from David Slosburg, another board member of OPA. \n   \nMello said Kotouc gave his campaign $1,000 this month, which is after the deadline for this campaign finance report. \n   \nAbout Mello\u2019s Republican donors, Stothert said: \u201cSome people aren\u2019t used to being told no. It\u2019s much easier to say yes. I still think the right answer was no in these cases. If they\u2019re angry about it, so be it.\u201d \n   \nSaid Mello: \u201cI\u2019m the leading challenger who has a vision for the city, running against a mayor with no vision.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Local government news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Omaha's Stothert-Mello mayoral race looks to be competitive, costly","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Madison","zipCode":"68701","state":"Nebraska","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Norfolk","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Norfolk Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"532180200","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"443"},"name":"Norfolk Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://norfolkdailynews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201665269","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/norfolkdailynews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/3f/b3f148e0-91a0-59b5-b687-765ed2f75772/588d9690e86e0.image.jpg?resize=300%2C452"}],"video":[]}}

Without this definition, what is the objective? The answer is there isn\u2019t one. This leaves one subject to a recommended lifetime of medication and therapy. Burris Institute has defined normal by defining behavioral epidemiology (behavior cause and control). This definition is used to establish baseline measurements for the client. \n\nStep 2: Measure Outcomes \n\nAt Burris Institute, measurable outcomes at every session are used as a foundational tool to define normal and calibrate progress regarding the primary emotional drivers of depression, PTSD, (anxiety) anorexia/addiction and co-occurring disorders. Without measurable outcomes, how do you know where you have started, where you are going or where you have ended up? \n\nHow Thought Emotion and Behavior Work \n\nEmotion and the resulting behavior could not happen without the process of thought. Therefore, after establishing an emotional baseline you will learn how thought, emotion and behavior work. When this foundation is established one can interrupt, restructure and reprogram any thought, emotion and behavior which does not work. \n\nAccountability \n\nFixing the mental health system requires accountability and this is done by first defining normal and then measuring outcomes based on this definition at every session. Burris Institute has faced fierce resistance to this over the past 27 years of measuring outcomes and defining progress of a client. \n\nStep 3: Eliminate Labels \n\nLabeling a long list of emotional issues as a disease enables pharmaceutical companies to sell you drugs for life based on the fact there is no cure for the disease they just invented. When normal is defined, a clear objective can be established and outcomes can be measured, tracked and improved over time. If it is indeed an emotional issue you are addressing and not a physiological issue, then labels are not only unnecessary they will cause stigma and ultimately impede your progress. \n\nThe Naming Convention of Mental Health and Mental Illness \n\nThe use of the term mental health and mental illness to describe aberrant emotion is at best deceptive and does not clearly represent the issue of the client. Emotional Wellness is a straight forward term that clearly and accurately describes what needs to initially be addressed and without the stigma or lack the of clarity of mental health or mental illness. By definition a thought process cannot be an illness or disease and emotion requires thought. \n\nStep 4: No Personal History \n\nIf the objective is to feel better and get control of one\u2019s emotional state digging into personal history while one is emotionally distressed can and will exacerbate emotional stress. If the emotional distress is specific to a thought process, which most if not all aberrant emotion is, then personal history or psychoanalysis is NOT useful. If a physiological issue is confirmed, a medical history is most certainly appropriate. \n\nStep 5: Measurement of Gut Health \n\nWith over half a billion neurons (brain cells) lining the gut and bidirectional communication with the main brain via the vagus nerve, measurement of gut health is not just a critical factor in Emotional Wellness (mental health) but overall physiological health. The Gut Health Checklist may reveal an issue that could prevent an Emotional Wellness Checklist from improving.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Depression Anxiety and the Brain in Your Gut: How Thought, Emotion and Behavior Work and How to Get Back to Normal","source":{"category":"Corporate","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Scribd","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"243896142","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"390"},"name":"Scribd","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Organisations","CompanySite"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.scribd.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201666487","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:44Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But instead of paintings or sculptures, they were examining scientific charts about climate change at a state environmental agency. \n\nAt a time when President Trump\u2019s new administration is ordering federal government scientists to stop communicating with the public, the array of data depicting carbon sequestration, ocean acidification and water temperatures at a conference on climate change was for some a political act of defiance. \n\n\u201cWe just have to push even harder than before,\u201d said Patricia Hidalgo-Gonzalez, a UC Berkeley student who brought her research on the electricity grid. \u201cRegardless of what happens in the rest of the country, California is going to stick with clean energy. We can be our own little island.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a stance that will be tested as California doubles down on its climate policies even as Trump steps back from the battle against global warming. And despite the bravado displayed last week at a conference on climate change hosted by state government officials, there was pervasive anxiety about the future as well. \n\n\"I'm worried,\" said a federal scientist at the exhibit who asked to withhold his name because he feared retaliation. Fearful that the Trump administration would strip climate information from government websites, he said he asked his team to start downloading information so they could continue their work. \n\nCalifornia has always charted its own course on cleaning up the air, clamping down on tailpipe emissions decades ago to fight smog in Los Angeles before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was even created in 1970. But the gap between Sacramento and Washington was growing into a chasm only a week after Trump took the oath of office. \n\nThe president is greenlighting oil pipelines that were rejected by President Obama. He told car manufacturers that regulations are \u201cout of control,\u201d and Oklahoma Atty. Gen. Scott Pruitt, his nominee to lead the EPA, expressed doubts about the severity of climate change during his confirmation hearing.\n\nMeanwhile, California is moving to dramatically slash its greenhouse gas emissions, and Senate leader Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) recently floated the possibility of generating all of the state\u2019s electricity from renewable sources such as solar and wind. Major utilities have proposed a $1-billion investment in electrifying the transportation network, including more charging stations for cars.\n\nIt\u2019s created a sense of dissonance for Californians, who are hunkering down even as they keep a wary eye on what\u2019s happening on the opposite side of the country.\n\n\u201cYou turn on the TV at night, and you hear these terrible things that are happening,\u201d said Kip Lipper, who works on environmental legislation for the state Senate. \u201cI tell my daughter, it\u2019s good to be cognizant of that, but this is the best place to be, in California.\u201d\n\nCalifornia emits only 1% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases, but the state has tried to transform itself into an international model for fighting global warming. While Trump talks about withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, officials here continue seeking new partners for the state\u2019s own, more ambitious international agreement.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown, in his State of the State speech Tuesday, said California wouldn\u2019t step back from its agenda no matter what happens in Washington, a message repeatedly emphasized by top state leaders at the climate conference.\n\n\u201cThis is when you do your best work,\u201d said John Laird, secretary of the Natural Resources Agency. \u201cWe can\u2019t worry about pulling back just to sink with everyone else who isn\u2019t moving at all.\u201d\n\nThe conference was planned before Trump won the presidency, but the results of the election created a charged atmosphere among the hundreds of scientists, government officials and advocates who showed up. Attendees talked about being \u201cresolute in our values,\u201d or how there\u2019s a \u201cmajor threat before us,\u201d or how strong policies are needed \u201cnow more than ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a greater seriousness in the room,\u201d said Jonathan Parfrey, executive director of Climate Resolve, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit that helped organize the two-day event.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s climate agenda remains controversial, and some business interests believe the state is putting itself at a competitive disadvantage by ramping up regulations. The state\u2019s premiere initiative \u2014 the cap-and-trade program, which requires companies to purchase permits to release greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere \u2014 is the target of an ongoing legal challenge.\n\nIn the two decades since Ben Santer helped write a landmark international report linking global warming and human activity, he\u2019s been criticized by politicians, accused of falsifying his data and rewarded with a dead rat on his doorstep. \n\nHe describes it as \u201cbackground noise,\u201d and he tries to tune...\n\nIn the two decades since Ben Santer helped write a landmark international report linking global warming and human activity, he\u2019s been criticized by politicians, accused of falsifying his data and rewarded with a dead rat on his doorstep. \n\nHe describes it as \u201cbackground noise,\u201d and he tries to tune...\n\nBut the week\u2019s events were also a reminder of how much further the state has moved past the national conversation about climate change. Debates revolve around how global warming should be addressed, not whether it should be, or whether it\u2019s even real at all. \n\nThree consecutive state administrations have pushed the state\u2019s policies forward. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, approved the country\u2019s first rules for regulating greenhouse gases from vehicle tailpipes. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed legislation setting an overall goal for reducing emissions in the state. Last year Brown enacted another law setting a new, stiffer target.\n\nA broad network of organizations \u2014 environmentalists, energy entrepreneurs and developers of carbon offset projects \u2014 has sprouted and expanded around these policies.\n\nAs further evidence, the conference hosted by state officials wasn\u2019t even the only event in Sacramento last week dedicated to California\u2019s climate agenda. Another gathering across town drew visitors from as far away as Australia to discuss the future of the cap-and-trade program. \n\nNo one there expected the state to change course. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole ecosystem built to reduce emissions,\u201d said Jon Costantino, an environmental policy advisor who previously worked at the California Air Resources Board. \u201cThere\u2019s investors, there\u2019s businesses, there\u2019s consultants.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cTo pull the rug out from under that would have a dramatic impact.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Chris Megerian"},"topics":[],"title":"As the White House changes course on climate change, California stubbornly presses forward","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Los Angeles Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587902","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"22602"},"name":"Los Angeles Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Health","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.latimes.com","publisher":"Tribune Company"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/ChrisMegerian"],"sequenceId":"695201675183","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d361f/turbine/la-pol-ca-california-climate-resolve-20170129/600"}],"video":[]}}

This dilemma faces a starving young woman in Victorian England, and when she is making her way home one evening a stranger tries to grab her purse, which holds a few meager coins. A man comes to her aid and although she cannot see his face, she thinks he is her guardian angel. He insists on looking after her and she reluctantly agrees, but she hears whispers from people as they pass in the night, and thinks they are about her. What develops is a mutual love; until one day in the park, the kind stranger vanishes. \n\nLonely Crippled Thomas & His Surprise Mail Order Bride - Thomas lives virtually alone in his house in Pennsylvania with only his cousin to look after him.

One day, Thomas\u2019 cousin puts an ad in for a mail order bride and to Thomas\u2019 utter surprise, one shows up from California a few weeks later. He is stunned, as is she, when they both learn about the deception. Thomas thinks the woman will despise him because of his crippled legs, while she, on the other hand, believes the same thing about her own physical disability.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"A Remarkable Life","source":{"category":"Corporate","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Scribd","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"243896142","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"390"},"name":"Scribd","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Organisations","CompanySite"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.scribd.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201676786","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:45Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We can be our own little island.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s a stance that will be tested as California doubles down on its climate policies even as Trump steps back from the battle against global warming. And despite the bravado displayed last week at a conference on climate change hosted by state government officials, there was pervasive anxiety about the future as well.  \n \n\"I'm worried,\" said a federal scientist at the exhibit who asked to withhold his name  because he feared retaliation. Fearful that the Trump administration would strip climate information from government websites, he said he asked his team to start downloading information so they could continue their work.    \n\nCalifornia has always charted its own course on cleaning up the air, clamping down on tailpipe emissions decades ago to fight smog in Los Angeles before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was even created in 1970. But the gap between Sacramento and Washington was growing into a chasm only a week after Trump took the oath of office.  \n \nThe president is greenlighting oil pipelines that were rejected by President Obama. He told car manufacturers that regulations are \u201cout of control,\u201d and Oklahoma Atty. Gen. Scott Pruitt, his nominee to lead the EPA, expressed doubts about the severity of climate change during his confirmation hearing. \n\nMeanwhile, California is moving to dramatically slash its greenhouse gas emissions, and Senate leader Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) recently floated the possibility of generating all of the state\u2019s electricity from renewable sources such as solar and wind. Major utilities have proposed a $1-billion investment  in electrifying the transportation network, including more charging stations for cars. \n\nIt\u2019s created a sense of dissonance for Californians, who are hunkering down even as they keep a wary eye on what\u2019s happening on the opposite side of the country. \n\n\u201cYou turn on the TV at night, and you hear these terrible things that are happening,\u201d said Kip Lipper, who works on environmental legislation for the state Senate. \u201cI tell my daughter, it\u2019s good to be cognizant of that, but this is the best place to be, in California.\u201d \n \nCalifornia emits only 1% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases, but the state has tried to transform itself into an international model for fighting global warming. While Trump talks about withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, officials here continue seeking new partners for the state\u2019s own, more ambitious international agreement . \n\nGov. Jerry Brown , in his State of the State speech Tuesday, said California wouldn\u2019t step back from its agenda no matter what happens in Washington, a message repeatedly emphasized by top state leaders at the climate conference. \n\n\u201cThis is when you do your best work,\u201d said John Laird, secretary of the Natural Resources Agency. \u201cWe can\u2019t worry about pulling back just to sink with everyone else who isn\u2019t moving at all.\u201d \n\nThe conference was planned before Trump won the presidency, but the results of the election created a charged atmosphere among the hundreds of scientists, government officials and advocates who showed up. Attendees talked about being  \u201cresolute in our values,\u201d or how there\u2019s a \u201cmajor threat before us,\u201d or how strong policies are needed \u201cnow more than ever.\u201d \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a greater seriousness in the room,\u201d said Jonathan Parfrey, executive director of Climate Resolve, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit that helped organize the two-day event. \n\nCalifornia\u2019s climate agenda remains controversial, and some business interests believe the state is putting itself at a competitive disadvantage by ramping up regulations. The state\u2019s premiere initiative \u2014 the cap-and-trade program, which requires companies to purchase permits to release greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere \u2014 is the target of an ongoing legal challenge . \n\nBut the week\u2019s events were also a reminder of how much further the state has moved past the national conversation about climate change. Debates revolve around how global warming should be addressed, not whether it should be, or whether it\u2019s even real at all.  \n \nThree consecutive state administrations have pushed the state\u2019s policies forward. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, approved the country\u2019s first rules for regulating greenhouse gases from vehicle tailpipes. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed legislation setting an overall goal  for reducing emissions in the state. Last year Brown enacted another law setting a new, stiffer target. \n\nA broad network of organizations \u2014 environmentalists, energy entrepreneurs and developers of carbon offset projects \u2014 has sprouted and expanded around these policies. \n \nAs further evidence, the conference hosted by state officials wasn\u2019t even the only event in Sacramento last week dedicated to California\u2019s climate agenda. Another gathering across town drew visitors from as far away as Australia to discuss the future of the cap-and-trade program.  \n\nNo one there expected the state to change course.  \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole ecosystem built to reduce emissions,\u201d said Jon Costantino, an environmental policy advisor who previously worked at the California Air Resources Board. \u201cThere\u2019s investors, there\u2019s businesses, there\u2019s consultants.\u201d \n\nHe added, \u201cTo pull the rug out from under that would have a dramatic impact.\u201d \n   \nchris.megerian@latimes.com \n\nTwitter: @chrismegerian \n\nALSO \n\nFearing climate change databases may be threatened in Trump era, UCLA scientists work to protect them \n\nEarth sets heat record in 2016 \u2014 for the third year in a row \n\nUpdates on California politics","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Chris Megerian"},"topics":[{"name":"Los Angeles news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Environment news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Climate change news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"As the White House changes course on climate change, California stubbornly presses forward","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Orange","zipCode":"92626","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Costa Mesa","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Pilot","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169702712","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Daily Pilot","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailypilot.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-trailguide-updates-trump-administration-orders-media-1485281190-htmlstory.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-pipelines-20170124-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-epa-pick-scott-pruitt-renews-climate-1484758778-htmlstory.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-1484938433-htmlstory.html#nt=outfit","http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-california-renewable-1484864454-htmlstory.html","http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-electric-vehicles-20170124-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-climate-20161127-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-me-pol-sac-climate-brown-agreement-20151206-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/jerry-brown-PEPLT007547-topic.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-jerry-brown-state-of-the-state-20170124-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-climate-court-hearing-20170124-story.html","http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/23/local/me-global23","http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-updates-arnold-schwarzenegger-jerry-brown-1475704818-htmlstory.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-jerry-brown-signs-climate-laws-20160908-snap-story.html","https://twitter.com/ChrisMegerian","http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-climate-change-data-20170121-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-hottest-year-2016-20170118-story.html","http://latimes.com/essentialpolitics"],"sequenceId":"695201683728","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d361f/turbine/la-pol-ca-california-climate-resolve-20170129/600"}],"video":[]}}

It follows \"Kissed by The Snow\" and \"The Oath.\u201d Most of the characters created in the book are action personalities with a big liking for law enforcement and weapons. \n   \nAlong these lines, if you like suspenseful, fast-moving detective stories, this would be an entertaining choice. \n   \nStarting with international intrigue, the book quickly moves to the connection with Lt. Col. George Custer through a modern-day ill-fated meeting between the main character, Tom McGuire, and an close friend at the Little Bighorn Battlefield Monument near Hardin, Mont. With the death of McGuire\u2019s friend Matt Conroy, the stage is set for the remainder of the book and amounts to a whodunit. \n   \nWith an almost cavalier style, the author blends mystery, murder, guns and beautiful women that would heavily appeal to the military/law enforcement background reader. Together with the continual almost prayerful stories about outlandish sniper shooting plus an almost godlike praise for those capable of 1,000-plus-yard headshots, the book also appeals to the military sniper-worshiping crowd. \n   \nThe main character comes across as a undiscovered super-asset who moves seamlessly from San Francisco detective through FBI and CIA contacts and crisscrosses the country on his journey to solve the mysterious killing of an old friend, and the motive of the international arms cartel behind that cowardly act. \n   \nWhile the book is a fun ride, there is one irritating factor in the organizational details: The book's 340 pages are split into 89 chapters, some just two or three pages long. What nonsense. \n   \nAlso, without revealing the details of the plot, there are many who will be insulted by the disparaging reference and fictional treatment of Custer in this book. The author takes great liberty in plucking an American hero from history and assigning him a less-than-honorable characterization. \n   \nAs the book moves quickly to what seems a foregone conclusion, it is nevertheless quite entertaining and very easy reading. Notwithstanding the strange chapter divisions, I would recommend this intriguing tale. Good reading.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Richard Tentis Citizen Reviewer"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Modern-day thriller has links to Custer","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Stark","zipCode":"58601","state":"North Dakota","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dickinson","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bismarck Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663469","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2812"},"name":"Bismarck Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bismarcktribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201694624","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Doug Burgum released his budget proposals that called for less spending than was in former Gov. Jack Dalrymple\u2019s budget. Burgum cited the continued drop in revenues for proposing about $160 million less in spending than recommended by Dalrymple. \n   \nLegislators generally seemed pleased with Burgum\u2019s plan. They weren\u2019t, however, ready to concede that they couldn\u2019t find more ways to cut spending. \"I call it a good start,\" said House Majority Leader Al Carlson, R-Fargo. \n   \nBurgum\u2019s budget proposal contains $13.3 billion, of which $4.62 billion is ongoing general fund spending. This is down from around the $13.475 billion proposed by Dalrymple, of which $4.78 billion was in general fund dollars. \n   \nIf legislators follow Burgum\u2019s budget, state employees will notice the cuts. Burgum wants about $100 million more in cuts in state agencies than proposed by Dalrymple. Burgum seeks to eliminate 633 full-time state jobs compared to the 583 proposed by Dalrymple. While state officials don\u2019t have an exact number, it appears more than half of the 633 cuts can be accomplished by not filling dark positions and retirements. \n   \nBurgum also wants to drop a proposed 1 percent state employee pay raise in the second year of the 2017-19 biennium. There\u2019s also a proposal to skip a 1 percent increase for K-12 education funding in the biennium's second year. Inflationary increases for Medicaid providers would be dropped that year as well. \n   \nState employees could be facing changing job assignments and less pay than anticipated. That shouldn\u2019t be unexpected during leaner times. On the campaign trail and after his election, Burgum has been calling on everyone to help him reinvent government. He envisons a more efficient government \u2014 one that does more with less money and fewer employees. That\u2019s the goal of all good businesses. \n   \nHow legislators wrap Burgum\u2019s proposals into a final budget will be interesting to watch. They have ideas of their own on how to make government more efficient. Legislators have begun debating a resolution that asks the public to vote on abolishing the state treasurer\u2019s office. Supporters argue eliminating the office will result in savings. State Treasurer Kelly Schmidt counters that her small staff has done a good job of managing the state\u2019s money and investments. \n   \nIt\u2019s a good debate to conduct. Legislators may decide they don\u2019t want to put the issue on the ballot because the treasurer\u2019s office is the best way to do business. If that\u2019s the case it will be a decision based on a good discussion. Everything should be under review for savings, but not everything needs to be changed. \n   \nBurgum and the Legislature are going in the right direction. The big budget decisions usually aren\u2019t made until the end of the session. If the new governor and the Legislature develop a good working relationship the final budget could launch North Dakota on the path to reinventing government.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Budget work to  test Burgum,  Legislature","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Stark","zipCode":"58601","state":"North Dakota","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dickinson","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bismarck Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663469","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2812"},"name":"Bismarck Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bismarcktribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201695139","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/bismarcktribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/a4/7a4ac127-3ee0-5c4f-8279-0e4901fcd691/586c61759ccf3.image.jpg?resize=300%2C212"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 42 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sacramento","zipCode":"95814","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Sacramento","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KCRA.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662541","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"522"},"name":"KCRA.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kcra.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201700198","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Van Hook University Center, speakers gave lectures ranging from creating the sound for theme parks to running security systems at JPL. \n \nFor Disney, Thompson is in charge of designing the way sound will play throughout Disney\u2019s alternate realities such as the upcoming Star Wars Land and \u201cAvatar\u201d based Pandora scheduled for construction in Disneyland and Disneyworld. \n \nBut aside from the career stats Thompson has to boast, he explained the importance of realizing the amount of work it takes to put together Disney\u2019s theme parks\u2019 enduring reality. \n \n\u201cIf you\u2019re a kid and you can walk through a park like Disneyland, and you\u2019re actually curious and looking around, that\u2019s good and actually shows you have a detailed mind,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cSomeone (made it that way) on purpose.\u201d \n \nThompson\u2019s small part in the technological and science fair highlighted the growing connection between STEM and the arts. \n \n\u201cA lot of the kids just don\u2019t realize that all of the different areas they\u2019re working at are inter-connected,\u201d said Johnson, \u201cand if you\u2019re working at one, you\u2019re probably going to need a foundation in the others, too.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Mauricio La Plante"},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Jack And Jill Hosts STEAM Expo At COC","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"91351","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Canyon Country","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KHTS AM-1220","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681671","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"20"},"name":"KHTS AM-1220","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Education","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hometownstation.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201700670","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:50:07Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Hornfischer \n   \nTitle: \"The Fleet at Flood Tide\" \n   \nPublisher: Bantam Books, 2016, hardcover. 503 pp. of text including charts and maps, 48 pp. BW photos \n   \nNaval historian James D. Hornfischer\u2019s subjects are the battles of the U.S. Navy on and around the Japanese-held islands in the Pacific in 1944 and 1945, and the enormous buildup of ships, planes and amphibious craft right up to the end of the war on Sept. 2, 1945. The subtitle of \"The Fleet at Flood Tide\" is \"America at Total War in the Pacific, 1944-1945.\" \n   \nA \u201cflood tide\u201d it was, with the construction through the end of 1944 of 24 aircraft carriers, eight battleships, 34 cruisers, 100 escort carriers, 1,117 auxiliaries, 293 destroyers, 503 destroyer escorts, 167 submarines, 2,489 patrol and mine craft, and 68,737 landing craft, plus the planes, ammunition and supplies and all the sailors, Marines and Coast Guard men to man and fight them. \u201cTotal war\u201d indeed. \n   \nWhile the Army under Gen. Douglas MacArthur supported by the Seventh Fleet took the war to the Japanese through the Philippines, Hornfischer\u2019s main emphasis is the Central Islands campaigns of the Third Fleet commanded by Admiral William F. Halsey and the Fifth Fleet commanded by Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. I read a lot of military history, but it took me a long time to figure out that these were not separate fleets, but one fleet with alternating commanders. \n   \n\u201cIn early May (Admiral) King and (Admiral) Nimitz met in San Francisco and devised a scheme of command whereby Spruance and Halsey would alternate as task force commanders, with (Rear Admiral) Mitscher and Rear Admiral John McCain as their respective underlings in command of the fast carrier task force. The rotation of Halsey and Spruance would ensure an ongoing study in contrasts along the doctrinal divide. When Spruance and Mitscher had command, their forces would be known as the Fifth Fleet and Task Force 58. When Halsey and McCain took over \u2026 the names would change to Third Fleet and Task Force 38.\u201d \n   \nThe \u201cdoctrinal divide\u201d was that Spruance used the carriers to protect the landing forces, while Halsey used them to pursue Japanese carriers. Spruance\u2019s use of the carriers protected the landing in the Marianas chain of the islands of Guam, Saipan and Tinian. Halsey sent the carriers after Japanese carriers leaving the landing at Leyte in the Philippines unprotected allowing destroyer escorts and escort carriers to be destroyed when Japanese battleships came through a passage between islands left unprotected by Halsey\u2019s Third Fleet. Heroically the sacrifices of four destroyer escorts and two escort carriers caused the Japanese to turn back before they got in among the landing forces. \n   \nHornfischer does not disguise his admiration for Spruance, who was not given a fifth star as a fleet admiral while Halsey received one. Hornfischer extensively covers Spruance and only has brief passages concerning Halsey and his battles.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 43 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Milwaukee","zipCode":"53201","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Milwaukee","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WISN Milwaukee","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169659888","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"504"},"name":"WISN Milwaukee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wisn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201704627","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

even if they held valid visas or other immigration permits. \n \nThe ruling, from US District Judge Ann Donnelly, prevented the removal from the US of people with approved refugee applications, valid visas, and \"other individuals... legally authorised to enter the United States\". \n \nThe emergency ruling also said there was a risk of \"substantial and irreparable injury\" to those affected. \n  \nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) tweeted the outcome of the ruling \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy legal director of the Immigrants Rights Project, argued the case in court and was greeted by a cheering crowd outside. \n \nHe said that some people had been threatened with being \"put back on a plane\" later on Saturday. \n \n\"The judge, in a nutshell, saw through what the government was doing and gave us what we wanted, which was to block the Trump order and not allow the government to remove anybody who has come and is caught up in the order, nationwide,\" he told the crowd. \n \nWhat does the ruling mean? By Nick Bryant, BBC New York correspondent \n \nWhile Judge Ann Donnelly ordered that the refugees and others trapped at airports could not be sent back to their home countries, the ruling stopped short of allowing them into America. \n \nNor did she address the constitutionality of the highly controversial executive order. Those held at airports might now be kept in detention while the case is resolved. A hearing is scheduled for the end of next month. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union said the ruling proved that the courts were the bulwark of US democracy and that when Donald Trump enacted laws or executive orders that were unconstitutional or illegal, the courts would protect people's rights. After just one week, it said, Donald Trump had suffered his first loss in court. \n \nMr Gelernt also said the judge had ordered the government to provide a list of names of those detained under the order. \n \n\"We are going to see each of the people, provide counsel, try and get them out of detention right now - but at minimum, they will not be returned back to danger,\" Mr Gelernt said. \n \nThe court has set a date to hear the case for the end of February. \n \nSpeaking earlier on Saturday, Mr Trump defended his executive order, saying it was \"not a Muslim ban\". \n \n\"It's working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\" Mr Trump told reporters at the Oval Office. \n \n\"This is a remarkable day,\" said the ACLU's executive director, Anthony Romero. \n \n\"What we've shown today is that the courts can work ... they're a bulwark in our democracy, and when President Trump enacts laws or executive orders that are unconstitutional and illegal, the courts are there to protect everyone's rights.\" \n \nMr Romero said the executive order was \"un-American\" and that \"flew in the face of established statutes that we have long regarded in this country.\" \n \nIn addition to those detained on arrival in the US, some air passengers were prevented from boarding US-bound flights after the order was signed. \n \nOn Saturday five Iraqi passengers and a Yemeni national were prevented from boarding a flight at Cairo airport bound for New York. \n \nDutch airline KLM said it had turned away seven people who were booked on to its flights into the US because they would no longer have been accepted \n \nThe restriction applies to dual nationals - so, for example, a British citizen who is also a citizen of Iran would not be able to enter the US. \n \nPublished: 29-01-2017 13:17 \n The Kathmandu Post  \u203a World  \u203a Bbc","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Global news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Trump executive order: US judge temporarily halts deportations","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"NP","country":"Nepal"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Kathmandu Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660511","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"14"},"name":"Kathmandu Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ekantipur.com","publisher":"eKantipur"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201705714","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Tima Kurdi, the aunt of the boy who became a symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis, called the U.S. ban on Syrian refugees inhumane and said she was proud of Canada. \n \nMr. Trudeau\u2019s tweet quickly received more than 150,000 likes. \u201cWelcome to Canada\u201d trended on social media in the country.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Canada news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Global news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"4hrs PM Trudeau says Canada welcomes refugees","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"The Hindu","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169592117","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"917"},"name":"The Hindu","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hindu.com","publisher":"The Hindu Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201710251","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

to cope with the fallout from President Trump's executive order barring citizens from seven countries entering the US as Australian business leaders called on the Turnbull government to help clarify its impact. \n\nCompanies are scrambling to cope with the fallout from US President Donald Trump's executive order barring citizens from seven countries entering the US as Australian business leaders call on the Turnbull government to help clarify its impact.\n\nMr Trump's executive order suspending all immigration from countries with terrorism concerns for 90 days has led to chaotic scenes at US airports as airlines move to enforce the ban on travellers.\n\nMr Trump's order bars citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the US even if they hold valid visas or permanent residence permits, a move that has caught many companies off-guard.\n\nThe US technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, has hit back at the order on immigration and some leaders have called it immoral and unAmerican.\n\nGoogle urgently called back employees from overseas and other companies rushed to provide legal advice and assistance.\n\nTravellers received a brief reprieve after two US judges temporarily blocked the administration from enforcing the order that would have required the removal from US airports of refugees, visa holders and legal US residents.\n\nPeter Strong, chief executive of the Council of Small Business Australia, has called on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Human Rights Commission to help clarify the ban on Muslim travellers to the US.\n\n\"At first glance, this will put employers and employees stuck between a rock and a hard place,\" Mr Strong said.\n\n\"Employers are not allowed to ask where their employees are from but, if they are going to the US for business or a conference, they now have to ask, in case that staff member will be banned.\n\n\"At least having the 90 days gives some time reference, but the Australian government and even the American Embassy need to keep the public informed.\"\n\nJames Pearson, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the order and its rapid implementation would cause uncertainty for Australian businesses, particularly those whose staff had dual nationalities and needed to visit the US.\n\n\"These businesses will be working overtime to see how they will be affected by the changes,\" Mr Pearson said.\n\nIn the US, Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings called it \"a sad week\" and added: \"It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.\"\n\nApple chief executive Tim Cook sent a letter to employees saying Mr Trump's order was \"not a policy we support\" and promised to help affected employees.\n\n\"We have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our co-workers and our company,\" Mr Cook added.\n\nElon Musk, the South African-born founder of Tesla and SpaceX who met recently with Mr Trump, said on Twitter: \"The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country's challenges.\"\n\nTelevision magnate and Seven West Media chairman Kerry Stokes, visiting the US, said Australia shouldn't worry too much about Mr Trump because it was on the right side of its trade balance sheet and was too strong to be led into acting against its own interest.\n\n\"I really don't care,\" the West Australian Rich Lister told Fairfax Media in Los Angeles on Saturday before Mr Trump's executive order was announced. \"The more things change they more they stay the same.\"\n\nIn Mr Trump's first week as president he suggested a 20 per cent tariff on all Mexican goods, as well as on goods from some other countries, and threatened to rewrite trade deals.\n\nMr Trump's administration this week also suggested intervening to stop China taking over territory in the South China Sea.\n\n\"I think we've got about a $60 billion credit with America against imports ... so Mr Trump should fall over us to keep us,\" Mr Stokes said.\n\n\"We're pretty strong, we've got a good government and I don't see us getting pulled into anything we don't want to be involved in.\"\n\nMr Stokes was visiting Los Angeles at the start of the annual G'Day USA week, which promoted Australian business, tourism and culture, and was attending the opening of Qantas' $40 million hangar at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\n\"It's great to see Qantas setting the standard because, at the end of the day, our entire future ... is about the importation of capital, goods and tourism,\" Mr Stokes said.\n\nQantas chief executive Alan Joyce echoed Mr Stokes' ease about the Trump administration, saying he doubted the protectionist president would affect the airline's business.\n\n\"We have a long tradition here, we're very comfortable at doing business here, this is a big market for us: none of that's going to change,\" Mr Joyce said.\n\n\"I don't think that's going to change with this administration or any administration.\"\n\nWith Agencies.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Patrick Hatch, Carolyn Cummins, Simon Johanson"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia

Proving you don't always get what you wish for. \n \nRETRO DREAMING \n \nTwo finals between the most compelling thirty somethings 'rivals' in the game, unseen for ten years in grand slam finals. Even if nothing else happened, Roger and Rafa in the final was enough but on top of that: Serena and Venus played a final; thirties were the new twenties with all finalists and most of the quarter-finalists aged thirty something; the world number one got beaten by a serve volleyer; oh and Ash Barty was playing WBBL cricket this time last year. \n \nTHE RETURN OF THE SERVE VOLLEY \n \nThe Zverev brothers made the biggest statement of this Open. Sascha because at 19 he has a game, as he showed in losing to Rafa, that will take him to tennis' peak. And Mischa because he played a game against Andy Murray that made many wonder if serve volley was back. \n \nIn Melbourne the courts and balls were faster. So Ivo Karlovic set a new Australian Open record for most aces in a match (75 against Horacio Zabellas). Games were taking less time than Rafa takes picking at his undies. \n \nTHE EFFIN' COMEBACK \n \nEff me if she didn't f'n make the f'n semis. FFS. Lucic-Baroni delivered the most candid on court post-match interview making her first quarter final in twenty years. \n \nAsked how she persisted for so long against so many obstacles she replied: \"Eff everything and everybody whoever tells you you can't do it. Just show up and win in your heart.\" \n \nShe then won her next match and this time tearfully hinted more at the back story for why the woman dubbed the next Steffi Graf had not realised that potential for 20 years. \n \nTWEET TWEET \n \nRoger does everything the best, even tweets. Federer tweeted a video of his new boy band \u2013 him, Gregor Dimitrov and Tommy Haas - singing \"How to say I'm Sorry\". \n \nALL ADVICE WELCOME, NOT HEEDED \n \nIf losing after imploding on the court wasn't enough Mark Philippoussis giving career advice on how to right his career has to be Nick Kyrgios' penny drop moment. \n \nHis meltdown loss to Andreas Seppi came after being up two sets to one and a break. Afterwards he admitted, finally, that hey being the only player in the top 100 without a coach might not be the smartest move. \n \nWHO ARE YOU WEARING? \n \nEven Daria 'Dasha' Gavrilova did a double take when she appeared on court against Timea Bacsinszky wearing identical outfits. \n \n\"It's a bit weird, but what can we do?,\" she said. \n \nIt sent social media buzzing in the way only the truly irrelevant can and was only outdone by Mirka Federer's jumper choice - a pink and green Gucci number with the words L'aveugle par amour, (\"blind love\", or \"blinded by love\") written on it. Big in central europe but not so pleasing to tennis fans it seems. \n \nTHE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE OF \"WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN AT?\" \n \nThings got testy on court between bustling Jo Wilfried Tsonga and Stan Wawrinka who is ordinarily as deadpan as a fondue bowl. \n \nTsonga muttered about Wawrinka giving him greasy looks. \n \n\"I looked at you when? Did I look at you at all? It's a tennis match. You've got to calm down, relax a bit.\" Wawrinka protested quite reasonably. \n \n\"There's no worries,\" Tsonga said. But plainly there is. \n \nThe pair both live in Switzerland and had been close but things went awry a few years ago after Stan's first slam when Tsonga was quoted in L'Equipe saying \"If Stan can win a slam, then I deserve one too\". \n \nADIEU \n \nAnd with that we bid adieu to Australian Open 2017. Welcome back next year when Pat Rafter and Pete Sampras are favourites to play in the final on a green court.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Michael Gleeson"},"topics":[{"name":"Top Australia stories","group":"Top stories"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Australian Open 2017: The hits and misses of the tournament","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4000","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Brisbane Adelaide Street","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Brisbane Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658354","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"191"},"name":"Brisbane Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201725492","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:10Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The \u201csanitised\u201d report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). \n \nThe report, whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986. \n \nThe very first sentence of the report\u2019s available (undeleted) page reads: \u201cPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\u201d It, however, later clearly said that \u201cassassination is the major near-term threat\u201d to him. \n \nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991. \n \nThe first section titled \u201cKey Judgments\u201d analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India\u2019s relations with the US, the then USSR and the region. \n \nThreats \n \nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi\u2019s life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder. \n \n\u201cIf Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures \u2014 including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India \u2014 were taken by the Indian President ...... (deleted),\u201d it said. \n \nInterestingly, it also names P.V. Narasimha Rao and V.P. Singh, who could be the \u201cinterim successor\u201d and \u201clikely candidates\u201d in case of sudden exit by Rajiv. Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991. \n \nIn a section, titled \u2018The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy\u2019, the report says \u201cIn our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\u201d besides \u201ca fanatical Hindu\u201d. \n \nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis. However, another section deals in-depth with Rajiv\u2019s mediation efforts to resolve \u201cthe conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo...\u201d \n \nGandhi's departure \n \nBesides Gandhi\u2019s possible assassination, the report also analysed various scenarios of his \u201cabrupt departure\u201d from the political scene before 1989. \n \n\u201cAlthough we believe assassination is the major near-term threat to Rajiv\u2019s tenure, any of several other events could cause his abrupt departure from the political scene before 1989,\u201d it said while listing out several other possibilities including \u201chis death from natural causes or by accident\u201c. \n \nIt ruled out the possibility of a decision by him \u201cto resign out of frustration\u201d, saying \u201cwe see no signs of this and believe it would be out of character\u201c. \n \nThe CIA report also noted: \u201cWe suspect, however, that Rajiv would calculate \u2014 as we do \u2014 that he and his kin would be targets for extremist violence even if he left public office.\u201d \n \nIn a section called \u201cImplications for the United States\u201d, the report says \u201cWe believe (Rajiv) Gandhi\u2019s death would represent a significant blow to US interests, regardless of the circumstances of the succession.\u201d \n \n\u201d...We believe Indo-US relations could also suffer as a result of domestic political changes following Rajiv\u2019s assassination.\u201d \n \nThe report assessed Rajiv\u2019s policies ranging from dealing with extremists, foreign relations (including Sri Lankan Tamil issue) to promoting acquisition of selected foreign technology\u201d among others, and their outcome. \n \n\u201cAlthough some of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s policies will continue to encounter serious resistance over the next several years, we believe his dominance of the Indian political scene is secure until at least the end of his present term of office in December 1989, barring his incapacitation or death,\u201d it said. \n \nThe report also dealt with the possibility of a \u201cnational government\u201d taking over in case of a sudden exit by Rajiv, while discounting the possibility of a military coup in such a scenario. \n \nSeveral portions of the 23-page report were deleted before the CIA decided to release it under the Freedom of Information Act.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sri Lanka news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"}],"title":"19mins \u2018CIA assessed Rajiv assassination 5 years before he was killed\u2019","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"The Hindu","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169592117","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"917"},"name":"The Hindu","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hindu.com","publisher":"The Hindu Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201725984","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It's always a great feeling to come back.\"\n\nBoston won its third straight after squandering a 16-point second half lead and a 42-point first quarter, its best of the season.\n\n\"I thought we played pretty darn well, to be honest, and then defensively and in the overtime I thought we were excellent,\" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo led Milwaukee with 21 points, and Greg Monroe had 14 points and 13 rebounds. The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine.\n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3s to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane.\n\n\"We're taking a step forward toward the right direction,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"We got back into the game, but we weren't mature enough to close it out.\"\n\nRALLY FALLS SHORT\n\nThe Bucks trailed 69-53 early in the third quarter, taking the lead briefly with just under 5 minutes to play on a three-point play by Monroe, who scored 10 of his 14 in the final quarter.\n\n\"I was just trying to be aggressive,\" Monroe said. \"Just trying to make the right play.\"\n\nThomas hit a 3 and the Bucks couldn't tie it again until Monroe hit the first of two free throws with 37 seconds to play that tied it at 102.\n\nTIED UP THOMAS\n\nThomas' 3 with 4:33 left was his final points of the night. The Bucks switched up defenses on him, doubling him off screens and forcing him to give up the ball.\n\n\"They were face guarding, denying, double-teaming - they were doing it all,\" Thomas said.\n\nWhen he tried to make plays, he pressed, including missing an off-balance 3-pointer that would've won the game in the closing seconds of regulation.\n\nCrowder said it was an important lesson for the Celtics for the future.\n\n\"The playoffs, it's not going to be easy, we can't depend on him to do everything in the playoffs on the offensive end,\" Crowder said. \"That's what good teams find a way to do, they find a way to score and a way to get a win without their offensive threat.\" First-round draft pick Thon Maker received his second career start in place of center Miles Plumlee. He provided a jolt during Milwaukee's rally in the third quarter, scoring four points and blocking a shot by Thomas that energized the crowd.\n\n\"I thought he changed the game in the second half,\" Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. \"His effort was great, and we'll see how it goes when we get to Utah.\" Celtics: Thomas has scored 20 or more in 31 straight games and 30 or more 16 times this season. ...

After trailing by as many as 12 points in the half, and 15 points within the first minute of the second half, the Bonnies reeled off 11 straight points down the stretch to make it a one-possession game at 55-52 with four minutes to go.\n\n\"We played on our heels, we missed four front ends of one-and-ones, layups they got into us,\" said Schmidt, whose Bonnies had a three-game win streak snapped. \"We showed some character there coming back. We were down by 18 to St. Joseph's and came back and won it.\n\n\"The Atlantic 10, you have to play well at home or away. You have to play every possession - the level of competition is too high for you just to show up.\"\n\nIt seems like yesterday, rather than the quarter-century that Schmidt was suited up in the green and gold of Bishop Feehan High (class of 1981) where he finished his career as the Shamrocks' No. 2 all-time leading scorer with 1.450 points.\n\nEarlier this season, Schmidt moved into the No. 2 spot as the all-time winningest coach at St. Bonaventure, surpassing Jimmy Satalin, and second only to Larry Weise (202 wins). Schmidt is currently at 159-139.\n\nThe Atlantic 10 Conference's Coach of the Year last season, Schmidt led the Bonnies to a share of the regular season title with their best-ever league record (14-4) along with a regular-season record 22 wins, marking the first 20-win season for St. Bonaventure since 1976-77.\n\nAnd yet, despite being deemed a shoo-in as an at-large team for the NCAA, the Bonnies were snubbed and had to settle for their 16th NIT appearance.\n\nSchmidt's current roster has three seniors and four juniors, including players from six states, as well as from Montreal, Toronto and Nigeria - including five transfer student-athletes.\n\nThe Bonnies' backcourt of Jaylen Adams and Matt Mobley is the fourth-highest scoring set of guards in the country, averaging 41.2 points per game. Adams is No. 2 in the A-10 in scoring and No. 16 nationally (21.6), while also leading the league in assists (112). Mobley ranks No. 4 in the A-10 in scoring (19.6) and is second in 3-pointers (57 made, 41 percent shooting) with the duo fueling the A-10's most prolific offense that averages 80.8 points per game.\n\nAgainst URI, Adams scored 25 points, but Mobley was reduced to nine points (on 1-for-10 shooting). Not just that, but the Bonnies shot just 30 percent overall for the game (6-for-19 on 3-pointers); committed 15 turnovers; had 15 shots blocked; and surrendered 38 points in the paint to the Rams (13-7).\n\nURI had four players in double-scoring figures with senior forward Hassan Martin (20 points, eight rebounds, four blocked shots), Kuran Iverson (12 points, nine rebounds, six blocked shots), E.C. Matthews (13 points, four rebounds, three assists) and Jared Terrell (12) leading the way. Notably, URI had 18 assists on its 25 field goals.\n\nThe Bonnies (13-7, 5-3) had won four of their last five outings, including three straight - averaging 80.8 points per game on 46 percent shooting from the floor. However, the Bonnies are only No. 96 on the RPI Index.\n\n\"You have to find a way to win when you're not playing your best,\" said Schmidt. \"Those are the days and the games that you need to pull out if you want to have a decent year.\n\n\"We were too passive in the first half,\" he added. \"In this league, if you don't play with passion, with a sense of urgency, you're not going to win. You just can't show up. We have guys who don't quit.\"\n\nSchmidt's Bonnies have had six seasons with .500 records or better. Over the past four seasons, St. Bonaventure has been a flagship for the A-10.\n\nNot surprisingly, Schmidt's name has surfaced for other coaching jobs on the East Coast, notably at his alma mater, Boston College, when Steve Donahue was not re-hired, and at Rutgers, after Mike Rice departed.\n\n\"If you don't show up in this league, you're going to get beat,\" added Schmidt, the Bonnies having to play with chips on their shoulders. \"That's how we do it, we don't have top-100 players, we have guys that are under the radar, kids that love to play, have a passion for it and work hard.\n\n\"That's how we've done it, our goal is to stay in the top six (in the A-10). Even after last year, you have to play with confidence, that you can play at this level - we can't take a back seat to anybody.\" The Bonnies are tied for third place in the A-10 while URI team improved to 9-1 at home. ... St. Bonaventure's defense has improved in A-10 play, primarily over the past three games as the Bonnies allowed an average of only 56 points per game to Fordham, Saint Louis and Saint Joseph's - in each, limiting those teams to 21 points or less in a half. In their seven A-10 games, the Bonnies have allowed an average of 69 points per game compared to 77 points per game over 12 non-conference games. ... On the glass, the Bonnies rank second in the A-10 in offensive rebounds at 12.5 per game and No. 3 in overall rebounding margin, having won the battle of the boards in 12 of 19 games. ... URI has a 36-29 lead in the series, although St. Bonaventure won five of the last seven games.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Ex-Shamrock Schmidt not letting Bonnies rest on their laurels","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Norfolk","zipCode":"02035","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Foxboro","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sun Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169794068","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"961"},"name":"Sun Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thesunchronicle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201739224","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:50:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thesunchronicle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/2f/02fb6b24-52b4-54d7-bad6-398e6ed7198f/588d816b2b4c7.image.jpg?resize=300%2C427"},{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thesunchronicle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/2f/02fb6b24-52b4-54d7-bad6-398e6ed7198f/588d816b2b4c7.image.jpg?resize=443%2C630"}],"video":[]}}

It's every coach's dream, and at least through Saturday's game, Traversi was living it.\n\n\"We have all the keys to be successful - our support staff, our athletes, our academic advising, we have every piece of the puzzle to be successful,\" the former Bishop Feehan High School standout said Saturday. \"In that respect I'm not surprised because of everything around me, but how well the girls have taken to my coaching and their collective buy-in has been a pleasant surprise.\"\n\nThere are always pitfalls along the way, and Traversi's team hit one of them Saturday at Assumption College in Worcester, losing a 63-58 decision in overtime. Heading in, the Panthers had won 14 straight games, were 18-2 overall and had a five-game lead atop the Northeast-10 Conference's Southwest Division.\n\nIndeed, in just her first year of coaching at the NCAA Division II level, the Attleboro native had her team ranked 14th nationally before hitting the speed bump put down by the 14-5 Greyhounds at the Laska Gymnasium.\n\n\"Today, unfortunately, we took a step back,\" Traversi said, \"but I think we can learn a lot from this game. And moving forward, I expect big things from this team.\"\n\nNow 34, Traversi is long removed from her playing days at Feehan, as well as at the University of Maine and in the Swedish professional league. Her coaching has also matured along the path she took from the high school ranks at Brookline, Dover-Sherborn and Attleboro and then Wheelock College.\n\nThe first thing noticed as Saturday's game begun was that Traversi is much more vocal and more animated on the sidelines than she was as the coach at Attleboro High. Not that she was a Shrinking Violet when she was coaching the Bombardiers, but coaching in the college allows a coach to be more demonstrative in barking instructions to her players, and to deliver them in a tone for the moment that's unmistakable in its intent.\n\nOr maybe it's just because there are bigger crowds at the college level.\n\n\"It's so loud out there, I have to be louder,\" she said.\n\nThe game did not start well for the Panthers. The guard play was sloppy, outside shots weren't falling, and Assumption's taller and more physical frontcourt was dominating the offensive rebounding. There were too many one-shot possessions to suit Traversi, who slammed her foot into the hardcourt in exasperation several times over what she perceived to be a lack of execution.\n\nIn the second quarter, things didn't get much better - and when Assumption senior guard Morgan O'Brien hit two quick 3-pointers to create a 16-point lead late in the quarter, one got the sense that Adelphi's 14-game winning streak was definitely in jeopardy.\n\nBut the Panthers managed to drop in a couple of baskets in the waning minutes of the first half to trail 32-21 at the break. That was a good sign, and they carried the momentum into the third quarter with a 7-2 run over the first six minutes.\n\nThat expanded to 14-2, resulting in a brief 35-34 lead, as the Panthers' defense and rebounding responded to Traversi's expectations and created a host of transition scoring opportunities. But a technical foul against senior forward Calli Balfour broke the momentum, and Assumption closed the quarter with a 6-0 run to lead 40-35 at the last stop.\n\nThe deficit was 48-43 with seven minutes left when Adelphi started playing its best basketball of the day. Defense and rebounding created offensive opportunities, and the Panthers started attacking the basket instead of passively setting up in the halfcourt.\n\nThree straight drive-penetration jumpers by sophomore guard Niajah Morgan (game-high 16 points) put Adelphi up 49-48 with 3:10 left, and the run reached 9-0 (for a 52-48 lead) on a baseline drive by senior Sierra Clark with 1:42 to go.\n\nBut Assumption came back to tie the game twice - first on a cross-lane drive by Shayla Hubbard with 33.4 seconds left, then following Morgan's drive for a 54-52 Adelphi lead with 9.3 seconds left, on a jumper by Kelly Carey with 7.2 ticks left to force the extra session.\n\nAdelphi led once in overtime, on a foul-line jumper by Morgan with 4:40 left. But Assumption's Hubbard answered in the paint with 3:17 to go, and a 3-pointer by Carey with 1:47 left put the home team in front to stay.\n\nThe loss notwithstanding, Traversi's players respond to her as if they've played for her for years - impressive, in that only one, former Bishop Feehan standout and starting forward Sierra Schrader of Hopedale, is on the roster and knew who she was.\n\n\"We have a pretty fantastic chemistry going on right now,\" Traversi said. \"We understand that anything that comes out of my mouth is for the betterment of the team. We're all trying to do the same thing, which is to win.\n\n\"And today, we did our very, very best,\" she added. \"Assumption, they came out and they responded. We had our moments, and they had theirs, and that's what's great about this game.\"\n\nTraversi hasn't entirely lost touch with her roots as she builds a successful program on Long Island; next year, local hoop stars Julia Strachan of Attleboro and Emily Miccile of Bishop Feehan will be joining the Panthers' ranks.\n\nBut that's long way away. For any college basketball coach, the here and now is the most important thing.\n\n\"Since we started the season, it's been very much about a climb, and being on that mountain together, taking it one possession at a time and one game at a time,\" Traversi said. \"And that hasn't changed. Right now it's about Pace (University, Wednesday at Adelphi), and after Pace, it's going to be about the next opponent. We just need to continue to get better and learn from games like this.\"\n\nMARK FARINELLA may be reached at 508-236-0315 or via email at mfarinel@thesunchronicle.com.

Martellus Bennett can entertain the media on a regular, non-descript weekday, let alone on the biggest stage that the NFL has to offer.\n\n\"Any chance I get to do the things I love, which is to play football and to be pretty good at it, then I'm always happy,\" the Patriots' tight end said Friday. \"I try to do the things I love more each day. So whether it's drawing or writing or watching movies with my family I make sure I make time to do the things I love and not spend the time doing things I don't love. So I only do the things I love to do.\"\n\nOne of those is apparently talking, and Bennett is as good at that as he is at playing his position.\n\nThat should come in handy during the myriad of media opportunities Bennett will have to entertain the assembled Fourth Estate in his hometown of Houston beginning Monday.\n\nBorn in San Diego, but raised in Houston, Bennett attended Texas A&M and played briefly for the Dallas Cowboys. But now, he will have the chance to display his talents at a Super Bowl competed on his own home turf - which, oddly enough, he claims he didn't envision as he was growing up in this east Texas metropolis.\n\n\"I don't think I was thinking of that as a young kid, with my imagination,\" Bennett said. \"It was more about dragons and wizards. I just felt that football was what we did. It was what we did.\n\n\"In Texas, if you don't play football, you're a weirdo,\" he added. \"I always laugh because I tell people in Texas it's oil, football and God. So growing up there and just playing football there, it was always something. We didn't have to imagine it, it's just what we did.\"\n\nBut he admitted he may have one of those \"welcome to the NFL\" moments a week from now even though he's been in the league since 2008. It is likely to happen in the moments before the Patriots take on the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI, and it will help if the retractable roof at NRG Stadium is open at the time.\n\n\"I have that moment before every game,\" he said. \"Just being in the moment and being present, one of my favorite parts of the game is when the planes fly over the stadium. It just reminds me of everything I went through to get to where I am. Building trust with my teammates and the guys on the other team's sideline, everyone put in so much work to get to where we are. So it seems like that moment before every game, and I'm pretty sure this one won't be any different.\"\n\nWhile the Super Bowl will be a new experience for him, the Bennett family has already been represented at two of them. Older brother Michael went to back-to-back Super Bowls with the Seattle Seahawks, including their loss to the Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX in Phoenix two years ago.\n\n\"I really love my brother,\" he said. \"I'm very proud of him and he's very proud of me. He's been a guy that I've worked with my entire life because we're only 16 months apart. So every day that I've been on this earth, he's been by my side and had my back.\n\n\"When he went to the Super Bowl, I was talking about all the hard work we put in together and all we've done for one another, and I think it was pretty much the same reflection for him when I made it as well,\" Bennett continued. \"So I'm very proud of him. He's in the Pro Bowl and, hopefully, he'll get another Pro Bowl MVP and I'm in my first Super Bowl. We just kind of keep building off each other and picking each other up. We've never been competitive with one another, we've always been supportive.\"\n\nBennett said he expects that being on the playing-team side of the Super Bowl will be a hoot.\n\n\"I don't know, I've never really experienced it,\" he said. \"I usually do the tour thing when I'm there. So I don't know what this is going to be like, but the good news is it'll be a new experience for me and I'll be the same person I always am and hopefully it's fun.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Patriots' headliner Bennett ready for Houston spotlight","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Norfolk","zipCode":"02035","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Foxboro","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sun Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169794068","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"961"},"name":"Sun Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thesunchronicle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201740631","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:40:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thesunchronicle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/8f/a8fd2990-feba-5dcd-a066-9a1d5f413bf4/588d783539c41.image.jpg?resize=527%2C630"},{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thesunchronicle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/8f/a8fd2990-feba-5dcd-a066-9a1d5f413bf4/588d783539c41.image.jpg?resize=300%2C359"}],"video":[]}}

He was unopposed in November. \n \nSome of the challenges he will face as sheriff \u2014 such as budget limitations, serious crime and the growing opioid epidemic \u2014 should be nothing new to this longtime leader in the law enforcement field. Now, however, he also will deal with new issues like managing an often-overcrowded county jail and overseeing an operation that is more than three times the size of his previous department. \n \nTo further complicate budget matters, the outgoing sheriff had submitted a budget request calling for a $1.4 million increase based on negotiations and anticipated raises among the sheriff\u2019s office unions. Monroe said he knows he must perfect a balancing act between managing the needs of his employees along with the expectations of the taxpayers. \n \nThese issues would be challenging for any new department head to face, but couple that with the politics of holding an elected position for the first time in your life, and the goal of making a seamless transition and managing a large, critically important department suddenly becomes even more complicated. \n \nUnfortunately, we often see elected officials become swept up more in politics than in the service they were elected to provide. \n \nWe have no reason to believe that might be the case here. We realize Monroe has experience in Howland with making and implementing often unpopular decisions. \n \nWe know he already has met three times with Trumbull County Auditor Adrian Biviano and two commissioners as they worked to assemble the 2017 general fund spending plan that involved allocations for his new office. It\u2019s that type of advanced planning and tenacity that give us high hopes about the future of the sheriff\u2019s department. \n \nWe also know Monroe ran a strong campaign that included much time knocking on doors, particularly in the rural parts of Trumbull County served by the sheriff\u2019s office. He made himself known to the constituents who may not have been very familiar with his service in Howland, and listened to their concerns. \n \nWe urge Monroe to keep his focus on fighting crime, providing service and running a tight ship. We remind him not to forget the issues and concerns shared by residents of Trumbull County, and expect that he will keep his focus more on those needs than on the politics that often begin to consume elected office holders. \n \nIf he serves well \u2014 and we suspect he will \u2014 any future political aspirations will follow naturally. \n \neditorial@tribtoday.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Keep focus on service, not politics","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Trumbull","zipCode":"44483","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Warren","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tribune Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169710805","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"299"},"name":"Tribune Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tribune-chronicle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201747203","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I'm not going to stir the hornet's nest, but a number of other teams have had the opportunity to control where they've played this year.\"\n\nAnother sticking point is training.\n\nUnited can train throughout the week at McKellar for minimal cost, but would get limited access to Canberra Stadium.\n\nLast time the Mariners were in town, Canberra played its season opener against Melbourne City as part of a Canberra Stadium double-header, losing that game 2-1.\n\nThey were unable to train on the ground in the lead-up to that match.\n\nUnited co-captain Ellie Brush reiterated Dower's preference, but added they'd be ready regardless of where the game was.\n\n\"This is our favoured home, but ... we don't really mind where we suit up, we know the crowd will get out and support us. Just two more [wins] to go,\" she said.\n\nDower said Brush's fellow co-captain Michelle Heyman was unlikely to be ready for the semi, although she had returned to training with the main group as she continued her comeback from toe and ankle injuries.\n\nThe Matildas striker has been out since she rolled her ankle against the Melbourne Victory at the end of December.\n\n\"She was back training [Friday], which was a great sight to see her out here at McKellar juggling, jogging laps, kicking the ball around,\" Dower said.\n\n\"It was really great.

Gen. Xavier Becerra in his new job, it was an unheralded duty that Republican legislators wanted to pin him down on during recent confirmation hearings in Sacramento: the vetting of ballot initiatives. \n\nThe attorney general is tasked under California law to write a brief title and summary of each measure that will end up on the state ballot. \n \n\u201cWhat will you do to ensure that you\u2019re being descriptive and objective, and following the election code, when you write those ballot titles and summaries?\u201d asked Assemblyman Jordan Cunningham (R-Templeton). \n \nTo understand the question requires knowing a bit of California political history. Attorneys general have long had the duty to collect and then prepare proposed initiatives before the measure\u2019s backers can begin collecting voter signatures. \n \nBut in the era of big money initiative campaigns \u2014 generally viewed as the years following the landmark 1978 property tax rollback, Proposition 13 \u2014 critics have occasionally complained of partisan scheming, alleging that the title and summary of an initiative are sometimes crafted in a way that pleases the attorney general\u2019s political allies. \n\nPolitical Road Map: Californians have a love-hate relationship with initiatives » \n\nOpponents of Proposition 13 complained that former Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger, a Republican, wrote a summary that didn\u2019t reveal the law made it harder to pass tax increases in the Legislature. Gov. Jerry Brown, in his time as attorney general, took fire over the ballot summary for the 2008 ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8 , and its emphasis on how the (now defunct) law would \u201celiminate\u201d the right of same-sex couples to marry . \n\nAdvocates of overhauling California\u2019s public employee pension system have balked more than once over initiative titles and summaries written by Democrats serving as attorney general. In 2005, a proposed reform was summarized as removing death and disability benefits. The most recent attorney general, now Sen. Kamala Harris, also came under fire for her summaries of efforts to change pension benefits for government workers . \n\nThe evidence is largely circumstantial. And judges have generally given pretty wide latitude to the attorney general, who\u2019s simply instructed in state election law to summarize \u201cthe chief purpose and points\u201d of an initiative. \n\nBut it\u2019s also a potential game changer. Strategists and pollsters often believe an initiative\u2019s title and summary is a prescient predictor of the campaign ahead. And some California voters make snap decisions on ballot measures based on those easily accessible nuggets of information. \n\nGiven that Democrats have held the office of attorney general for 18 years, it\u2019s hardly surprising that the loudest calls for change come from Republicans. But those efforts have been routinely rebuffed. \n\nIn 2015, legislation to impose new rules on the attorney general was quietly killed in the Assembly\u2019s appropriations committee. Earlier this month, newly elected Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (R-El Dorado Hills) decided to go one step further. His proposal would change the state\u2019s constitution and transfer the responsibility for initiative titles and summaries to the independent Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office, which currently writes a fiscal analysis of each measure. \n\nAs for Becerra, the Los Angeles Democrat told lawmakers in confirmation hearings this month that he believes in fairness when it comes to summarizing initiatives. \n\n\u201cI know many of you will be reading over my shoulders,\u201d he told assemblymembers on Jan. 10. \u201cAnd I understand the importance of a word.\u201d \n   \njohn.myers@latimes.com \n\nFollow  @johnmyers  on Twitter, sign up for our daily  Essential Politics newsletter  and listen to the weekly  California Politics Podcast \n\nALSO: \n\nCalifornia initiative campaigns rake in a record $473 million in 2016 \n\nPolitical Road Map: How unlimited cash gets funneled into legislative campaigns \n\nUpdates on California politics","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"John Myers"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Political Road Map: Some believe there's bias baked into the official descriptions of California initiatives","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"91203","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Glendale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Burbank Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169746369","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Burbank Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.burbankleader.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-xavier-becerra-california-attorney-general-snap-20170124-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-road-map-propositions-20161113-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/topic/social-issues/family/same-sex-marriage/proposition-8-%28california-2010%29-EVHST0000250-topic.html","http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/29/local/me-gaymarriage29","http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/07/news/la-ol-fighting-words-public-employee-pension-reform-20140107","http://www.twitter.com/johnmyers","http://www.latimes.com/newsletters/la-newsletter-essential-politics-signup-page-htmlstory.html","https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/california-politics-podcast/id1067429614?mt=2","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-november-proposition-money-20161107-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-roadmap-unlimited-money-legislature-elections-20161023-snap-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/essentialpolitics"],"sequenceId":"695201750219","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d2768/turbine/la-pol-ca-road-map-initiatives-title-summary-power-20170129/600"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 44 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Milwaukee","zipCode":"53201","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Milwaukee","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WISN Milwaukee","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169659888","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"504"},"name":"WISN Milwaukee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wisn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201751799","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We can be our own little island.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s a stance that will be tested as California doubles down on its climate policies even as Trump steps back from the battle against global warming. And despite the bravado displayed last week at a conference on climate change hosted by state government officials, there was pervasive anxiety about the future as well.  \n \n\"I'm worried,\" said a federal scientist at the exhibit who asked to withhold his name  because he feared retaliation. Fearful that the Trump administration would strip climate information from government websites, he said he asked his team to start downloading information so they could continue their work.    \n\nCalifornia has always charted its own course on cleaning up the air, clamping down on tailpipe emissions decades ago to fight smog in Los Angeles before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was even created in 1970. But the gap between Sacramento and Washington was growing into a chasm only a week after Trump took the oath of office.  \n \nThe president is greenlighting oil pipelines that were rejected by President Obama. He told car manufacturers that regulations are \u201cout of control,\u201d and Oklahoma Atty. Gen. Scott Pruitt, his nominee to lead the EPA, expressed doubts about the severity of climate change during his confirmation hearing. \n\nMeanwhile, California is moving to dramatically slash its greenhouse gas emissions, and Senate leader Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) recently floated the possibility of generating all of the state\u2019s electricity from renewable sources such as solar and wind. Major utilities have proposed a $1-billion investment  in electrifying the transportation network, including more charging stations for cars. \n\nIt\u2019s created a sense of dissonance for Californians, who are hunkering down even as they keep a wary eye on what\u2019s happening on the opposite side of the country. \n\n\u201cYou turn on the TV at night, and you hear these terrible things that are happening,\u201d said Kip Lipper, who works on environmental legislation for the state Senate. \u201cI tell my daughter, it\u2019s good to be cognizant of that, but this is the best place to be, in California.\u201d \n \nCalifornia emits only 1% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases, but the state has tried to transform itself into an international model for fighting global warming. While Trump talks about withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, officials here continue seeking new partners for the state\u2019s own, more ambitious international agreement . \n\nGov. Jerry Brown , in his State of the State speech Tuesday, said California wouldn\u2019t step back from its agenda no matter what happens in Washington, a message repeatedly emphasized by top state leaders at the climate conference. \n\n\u201cThis is when you do your best work,\u201d said John Laird, secretary of the Natural Resources Agency. \u201cWe can\u2019t worry about pulling back just to sink with everyone else who isn\u2019t moving at all.\u201d \n\nThe conference was planned before Trump won the presidency, but the results of the election created a charged atmosphere among the hundreds of scientists, government officials and advocates who showed up. Attendees talked about being  \u201cresolute in our values,\u201d or how there\u2019s a \u201cmajor threat before us,\u201d or how strong policies are needed \u201cnow more than ever.\u201d \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a greater seriousness in the room,\u201d said Jonathan Parfrey, executive director of Climate Resolve, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit that helped organize the two-day event. \n\nCalifornia\u2019s climate agenda remains controversial, and some business interests believe the state is putting itself at a competitive disadvantage by ramping up regulations. The state\u2019s premiere initiative \u2014 the cap-and-trade program, which requires companies to purchase permits to release greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere \u2014 is the target of an ongoing legal challenge . \n\nBut the week\u2019s events were also a reminder of how much further the state has moved past the national conversation about climate change. Debates revolve around how global warming should be addressed, not whether it should be, or whether it\u2019s even real at all.  \n \nThree consecutive state administrations have pushed the state\u2019s policies forward. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, approved the country\u2019s first rules for regulating greenhouse gases from vehicle tailpipes. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed legislation setting an overall goal  for reducing emissions in the state. Last year Brown enacted another law setting a new, stiffer target. \n\nA broad network of organizations \u2014 environmentalists, energy entrepreneurs and developers of carbon offset projects \u2014 has sprouted and expanded around these policies. \n \nAs further evidence, the conference hosted by state officials wasn\u2019t even the only event in Sacramento last week dedicated to California\u2019s climate agenda. Another gathering across town drew visitors from as far away as Australia to discuss the future of the cap-and-trade program.  \n\nNo one there expected the state to change course.  \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole ecosystem built to reduce emissions,\u201d said Jon Costantino, an environmental policy advisor who previously worked at the California Air Resources Board. \u201cThere\u2019s investors, there\u2019s businesses, there\u2019s consultants.\u201d \n\nHe added, \u201cTo pull the rug out from under that would have a dramatic impact.\u201d \n   \nchris.megerian@latimes.com \n\nTwitter: @chrismegerian \n\nALSO \n\nFearing climate change databases may be threatened in Trump era, UCLA scientists work to protect them \n\nEarth sets heat record in 2016 \u2014 for the third year in a row \n\nUpdates on California politics","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Chris Megerian"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"As the White House changes course on climate change, California stubbornly presses forward","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"91203","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Glendale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Burbank Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169746369","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Burbank Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.burbankleader.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-trailguide-updates-trump-administration-orders-media-1485281190-htmlstory.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-pipelines-20170124-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-epa-pick-scott-pruitt-renews-climate-1484758778-htmlstory.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-1484938433-htmlstory.html#nt=outfit","http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-california-renewable-1484864454-htmlstory.html","http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-electric-vehicles-20170124-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-climate-20161127-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-me-pol-sac-climate-brown-agreement-20151206-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/jerry-brown-PEPLT007547-topic.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-jerry-brown-state-of-the-state-20170124-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-climate-court-hearing-20170124-story.html","http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/23/local/me-global23","http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-updates-arnold-schwarzenegger-jerry-brown-1475704818-htmlstory.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-jerry-brown-signs-climate-laws-20160908-snap-story.html","https://twitter.com/ChrisMegerian","http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-climate-change-data-20170121-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-hottest-year-2016-20170118-story.html","http://latimes.com/essentialpolitics"],"sequenceId":"695201754195","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d361f/turbine/la-pol-ca-california-climate-resolve-20170129/600"}],"video":[]}}

It\u2019s the third straight season that the Broncos have won at least four road games in Mountain West play. The Broncos will remain on the road for a Tuesday game at Colorado State, which won at San Diego State on Saturday. The Rams have won three in a row and nearly beat Boise State in Boise last month before a buzzer-beating 3-pointer from Chandler Hutchison won it for the Broncos.\n\nBoise State and Colorado State are tied for second place in Mountain West at 6-3, one game behind 7-2 Nevada.\n\nTip off on Tuesday night is scheduled for 7 p.m. and the game will be streamed on ESPN3.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"B.J.

But they're better right now. Until we improve, they're going to keep beating us.\" \n\nRivers mostly sat and witnessed his team go down in the third quarter under an avalanche of Stephen Curry three-point slings and Warriors points that sent the Clippers to their eighth consecutive defeat to Golden State. \n\n\"If I won eight games in a row, I would have a mental edge,\" Rivers said. \n\nCurry, supposedly playing with a sore left quadriceps, detonated for 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter. He was five for eight from three-point range in the period, during which he seemed to be playing alone. \n\nFor the game he was 15 for 23 from the field, nine for 15 from three-point range. \n\nOf all the 72 points the Clippers surrendered in the first half, the most painful had to be when Curry eased up the court and casually and knowingly hoisted a three-pointer from half court that splashed through the net as the halftime buzzer sounded. \n\nThe fans went crazy. The Warriors celebrated, none more so than Draymond Green, who chest-bumped Curry so hard he fell on the court. Curry stayed on his belly for a few seconds, his arms extended. \n\nThe Clippers could only solemnly trudge to their locker room. \n\n\"We can talk about, like, being who we are. But who are we?\" Clippers guard J.J. Redick said. \"To me, we're the most inconsistent team, maybe in the league. Like, we're inconsistent. That's who we are. So, like, if we're going to be inconsistent, we can't expect to come in here and play these guys and be inconsistent and play well. It's not realistic.\" \n\nThe Clippers have lost four of five games since point guard Chris Paul had surgery for a torn thumb ligament that is expected to sideline him six to eight weeks. \n\nBut they will see the Warriors again Thursday night at Staples Center knowing it's going to take a better effort than this one. \n\nBlake Griffin, in his second game back after missing 18 games following right knee surgery, had 20 points for a Clippers team that was never in this game. \n\nThe total destruction by the Warriors notwithstanding, Rivers has been unsure what has put him in a weakened state. \n\n\"It has been three weeks now, so it's not been a fun stretch,\" he said. \"I'll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BRODERICK TURNERLos Angeles Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Curry, Warriors clobber Clippers, 144-98","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Benton","zipCode":"99336","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kennewick","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tri-City Herald Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688591","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2795"},"name":"Tri-City Herald Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tri-cityherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201782434","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The entire movie was profound, but one powerful scene has stuck with me ever since, when he hopped up on desk while teaching and said, \"I stand upon my desk to remind myself that we must constantly look at things in a different way.\" \nTo be able to look at things from many perspectives is an important life skill.Consider the words of author F. Scott Fitzgerald: \"The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise.\"Today's reviewed books offer different perspectives on three distinct ideas, and that is worth reading about.

Read yourself: age 9 - 10 and older.Sometime things come together in strange ways with no apparent connection. But, like pieces in a puzzle, one begins to see how they fit. So it is for 10-year-old Winnie Foster, the Tuck family and the strange man in the yellow suit.Winnie Foster is an only child and doted upon by her mother and grandmother. What Winnie really wants is to be by herself for a change, do something interesting. Fed up with being overprotected, Winnie decides to run away, just for a little while, into the woods. It was there that she meets Jesse Tuck.The Tuck family had stumbled upon eternal life after they drank from a magic spring 87 years ago. From that time on they never aged and couldn't die. They are stuck, exactly the age they were when they drank that water.When Winnie discovers the Tucks' secret, Jesse and his family are frantic. No one must find out about the magic spring, and the Tucks must make Winnie understand why - that living forever is not the blessing one might think. But a strange man in a yellow suit follows Winnie and Jesse and, having a different opinion of eternal life, tries to cash in on the Tucks' long-kept secret. It's up to Winnie to save the Tucks and ultimately do what she's longed for, to make a difference in the world.Magnificently written, it is little wonder that this classic story continues to be enthusiastically embraced since it was first published over four decades ago.

Read aloud: age 4 - 7. Read yourself: age 7.If someone asked for a description of what a cowboy is like, most of us would probably come up with the stereotype we've been exposed to: rough, rowdy, hardened men (or something like that).This beautiful book portrays what real cowboys are like. Real cowboys are gentle, patient, peaceful and sensitive. Real cowboys can be homesick, are \"as many different colors as the Earth,\" and girls, too.A warm tribute by Hoefler presenting readers with what a real cowboy is (and subsequently teaching kids to be like a real cowboy with the life lessons she imparts), this lovely book is perfectly complemented by the evocative illustrations of Bean.\" Are Pirates Polite ?\" by Corinne Demas and Artemis Roehrig , illustrated by David Catrow, Orchard Books/Scholastic, 2016, 36 pages, $16.99 hardcover. Read aloud: age 3 - 6. Read yourself: age 6 - 7.Through funny, rhyming text, kids learn that pirates actually have good manners. They say please and thanks, and although they can be rowdy up on the deck of their ship, they use their inside voices when down below. Pirates share their treasure equally, they don't interrupt one another, and they respect one another's privacy and don't go barging in through closed door; they always knock first.Through these and other things pirates do to be polite, kids will laugh along with this zany bunch of pirates that hilariously emphasize that good manners are important.

The two leaders made the agreement during their 42-minute long telephone conversation starting from 11:05 p.m. (1405 GMT) on Saturday, the first such talks since Trump sworn in as 45th U.S. president last week.\n\nBoth sides affirmed the importance of Japan-U.S. alliance and exchanged views in economic and security fields, Abe told reporters here after the call.\n\nAs for the two leaders' summit talks next month, Abe said he hoped to meaningfully and frankly exchange views with Trump in the fields including bilateral economic and security ties.\n\nThe Japanese Prime Minister also said he hope Japan will play its due role as U.S. alliance.\n\nJapan's Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hagiuda Koichi said after the call that Abe, in Saturday's telephone talk, also explained contribution of Japan's automobile industry to the United States.\n\nThe leaders think that the Japan-U.S. economic relationship is important, said Koichi.\n\nHowever, the two leaders didn't get into any detailed conversations on issues such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Free Trade Agreement (FTA), said the deputy chief cabinet secretary.\n\nDuring the telephone talk, Trump stressed that Japan-U.S. alliance is important and Japan is important partner for the United States, said Koichi.\n\nJapan has been eager to repair relations with Trump, as the nation has largely bet its support on Hillary Clinton in the U.S. Presidential election and Trump's win has caught it off guard.\n\nSoon after Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election, Abe held unofficial talks with the U.S. president-elect in New York in November last year.\n\nTrump on Monday signed an executive order to officially withdraw U.S. from the TPP trade deal as part of his efforts to protect American jobs.\n\nThe TPP, which Abe has backed enthusiastically, is a free trade pact between 12 Asia-Pacific countries and was formally signed by ministers from these 12 countries in last February after more than five years' negotiation.

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. \n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. \n\nThe Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up. Crowder scored eight of the Celtics' first 11 points to help Boston get out to a nine-point lead in the first 21/2 minutes. \n\nThat was just the beginning of what ended up as a 42-point first quarter for the Celtics. With Crowder leading the way with 11 points and Thomas chipping in 10, the Celtics picked apart the Bucks' defense on the way to 63.2 percent shooting from the field in the period in addition to 11-of-11 shooting from the free-throw line. Gerald Green put the exclamation point on the quarter by making a 25-footer before the buzzer that gave the Celtics a 42-27 lead after 12 minutes. \n\nIn that opening stanza, the Bucks got nothing from Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker. Milwaukee's leading scorers combined to go 0-of-8 from the field as Michael Beasley shouldered the scoring load off the bench with 11 points. \n\nAntetokounmpo made his first three shots of the second quarter, including a pair of dunks, to highlight an 8-0 run that brought the Bucks within eight, but that was as close as they would get. That's because Thomas subbed back in and went on a tear. He got fouled shooting a 3-pointer and made all three free throws, made a 26-footer and a 30-footer and hooked a left-handed layup over Snell on the way to scoring 13 points in the final six minutes of the second quarter, putting him at 23 at the half.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MATT VELAZQUEZMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Milwaukee Bucks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Boston Celtics news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Thomas shines again as Celtics hold off Bucks for 112-108 OT win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Benton","zipCode":"99336","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kennewick","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tri-City Herald Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688591","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2795"},"name":"Tri-City Herald Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tri-cityherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201787013","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He hit 12 of 18 field-goal attempts and 8 of 16 free-throw attempts and added six rebounds and three assists. \n\nBronson Koenig added 10, four on free throws in the overtime, but made just 2 of 10 3-pointers and 2 of 13 shots overall. \n\nUW made 3 of 25 3-point attempts (12.5 percent) and 20 of 60 shots overall (33.3 percent). \n\nNigel Hayes added seven points, a game-high 11 rebounds and four assists. He had five points in the overtime, as well as an assist on a basket by Happ. \n\nThe Badgers (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) continued their run through the league with their fifth consecutive victory since suffering an 11-point loss Jan. 8 at Purdue. \n\nUW won for the 14th time in the last 15 games overall and improved to 6-3 away from the Kohl Center this season (3-1 neutral site, 3-2 road). \n\nGuards Corey Sanders and Nigel Johnson scored 15 and 13 points, respectively, for Rutgers. \n\nRutgers, which suffered a 20-point loss to UW in Madison, saw its record fall to 1-8 in the league and 12-10 overall. \n\nThe Scarlet Knights entered the day as the Big Ten's worst shooting team in league play but the Badgers appeared determined to steal that title. \n\nThe Badgers, shooting 40.2 percent from 3-point range and 46.4 percent overall in Big Ten play, looked as if they hadn't practiced shooting for weeks. \n\nThey made 1 of 13 3-pointers (8.3 percent), 5 of 25 shots overall (20 percent) and went the last 10:36 of the half without a field goal. \n\nKoenig was 0 of 5 from 3-point range and 0 of 6 overall.

Hayes was 0 of 2, leaving the trio a combined 0 of 10 for the half. \n\nIf not for the early burst of Happ, who scored 10 of his 11 points in the first 4:15, UW's deficit would have been greater than five points. \n\nUW missed its last 12 field goal attempts of the half and lost the battle for points in the paint, 14-8 to Rutgers. \n\nThe Badgers missed their first six shots of the second half before Happ scored inside, with 16:44 left. \n\nThat ended UW's run of misses at 18 in a row and a span of 13:52. \n\nOuch.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JEFF POTRYKUSMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Happ helps Wisconsin escape Rutgers in OT, 61-54","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Benton","zipCode":"99336","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kennewick","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tri-City Herald Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688591","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2795"},"name":"Tri-City Herald Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tri-cityherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201787192","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

However, his latest six-week ban while playing for Northampton Saints after performing a stiff arm-tackle on Leinster's Sean O'Brien had raised questions on his discipline.\n\nDespite, heading into the tournament without proper match exposure, with the backing of head coach Eddie Jones, Hartley is set to lead England team in their title defence for the upcoming Six Nations and Gatland believes despite the setback, success for the Northampton hooker in the tournament will make him an automatic choice for Lions captaincy.\n\n\"If Dylan Hartley leads England to another Grand Slam that could sway it,\" Lions head coach Gatland told the Daily Telegraph.\n\n\"Dylan has done a great job with his leadership with England. The sending-off looked like frustration to me. But Dylan has to contend with pressure, too, that of Jamie George pushing for his place (in the England team).\"\n\nThis was not the first time a red card offence had affected Hartley's chances with the Lions as in the 2013 tour Australia, Rory Best replaced him after he was sent-off for abusing an official during the Aviva Premiership final.\n\nAdmitting England had a fantastic year under Jones, Gatland believes them maintaining the form will only benefit the Lions when they taken on back-to-back World Champions.\n\n\"The best thing is to have a strong England for the simple reason that all the other countries will be gunning for them, looking to knock them over, and so England will have to cope with that as well deal with the pressure of expectation that is on them as Grand Slam champions and on this long run of successive wins.\n\n\"A Lions tour is about pressure, of all sorts, and particular in the Test series, finding a way to come out on top.\n\n\"The players from the other countries will be absolutely up for it, busting a gut to put one over on England because the rewards for doing so are going to be massive, in the tournament itself and potentially for the Lions selection.\n\n\"I want to see how they go at England and how England respond. I want pressure to bring the out of them all. I want those players to front up. I want the English players to front up.

Or does it mean anything? \n \nMr Trump has pledged to boost infrastructural spending, slash tax on company profits and boost purchases of US products over foreign competitors. \n \nThat may result in an increase in profits of American companies. That is driving the market higher. \n \nThe measures may also help economic growth. \n \nHowever, his policies also include loosening regulation, speeding up environmental reviews for infrastructure projects and introducing more protectionist policies. \n \nThere are wider consequences from these policies that extend beyond the narrow prism of companies\u2019 profits. \n \n\"We think we can cut regulations by 75%. Maybe more,\" Mr Trump has told business leaders. \n \nAs Irish people are well aware, loosening any regulation can result in negative consequences in the absence of full analysis of effects. \n \nDonald Trump\u2019s policy on the environment is also disquieting.   \n \nThis week the Trump team instructed the US Environmental Protection Agency to remove its Climate Change section from its website, according to Reuters. \n \nBut that is the thin edge of the wedge. \n \nThe new president says he is committed to \u201celiminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan\u201d. \n \nHowever, the website Mr Trump is planning to obliterate is abundantly clear about the damage climate change is already doing to US agriculture, fisheries, livestock, health and transportation. \n \n\n \nIt says in blunt terms \u201cThe Earth is warming... The evidence is clear.\u201d \n \nOverlooking the effects of climate change and taking actions to add to emissions will have negative economic consequences. \n \nThe new administration\u2019s policies to boost infrastructural spending by one trillion dollars are also attracting attention.   \n \nMr Trump is vague about out how it would be financed. Republicans have warned against anything that would add to the US deficit. \n \nIn 2009 the Dow Jones dipped to 6,600 points, it is now above 20,000 (see graph). \n \nIn fact much of that gain can be attributed to policies of the Obama administration, which stabilised the financial system in the aftermath of the crisis. \n \nFor investors to automatically assume Trump\u2019s elevation is going to benefit the broader economy may be misguided. \n \nIf companies make more money it is worth questioning why that is happening and if wider society will benefit?   \n \nComment via twitter: @davidmurphyRTE","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"Regulatory news","group":"Business"}],"title":"David Murphy: Market loves Trump.

The debt limit, or debt ceiling, is currently set by law at $20.1 trillion. Nearly every time it has been necessary to raise the limit to stay ahead of federal government spending, the issue has set off turmoil in Congress and between the executive branch and Congress.\n\nThe matter could be made worse or handled more smoothly this time, due to the fact that the Republicans control both branches. The most adamant of the anti-national-debt-rising members of Congress are the Republicans in the Freedom Caucus. However, some members evidently are willing to \u201cballoon\u201d the national debt in the short term as the price to dismantle Obamacare. \n\nThe administration of President Donald J. Trump will \u2014 quite normally for a new administration \u2014 want to spend money to put its program into action. Besides dismantling Obamacare, Mr. Trump has pledged to increase military spending (let\u2019s hope not to invade Mexico), launch an infrastructure building-and-repair job-creating program, and cut corporate and personal taxes. It is by no means clear how he plans to do that without increasing the budget deficit, in the process running the national debt up further.\n\nAmericans, including Mr. Trump, looking at his business history, are somewhat accustomed to debt. Car loans across the country stand at $1.1 trillion, student debt at $1.3 trillion and mortgages at $8.4. trillion. No one seems to be panicked. But the national debt, $20 trillion now for a population of 320 million people, seems to remain something of a political third rail. By mid-March, the debt issue could offer new insight into Republican rule.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Raising the roof?

Progress has been slow but sure. A public-private partnership converted a 117-acre site into the LindenPointe business park that now includes health care services, a Butler County Community College branch, a workforce training center and a business incubator, known as the eCenter@LindenPointe, whose tenants read like a list of Carnegie Mellon University spinoffs. \n\nState grants helped establish the business park and provided the $25,000 for one of the contests intended to lure entrepreneurs from outside the area. But perhaps the most exciting part of the partnership\u2019s work is its up-by-the-bootstraps mentality, combined with a steadfast faith in homegrown ingenuity.

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same.\n\nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released.\n\n\"Mr. President, look at us,\" said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \"This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American.\"\n\nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \"We are all immigrants!\" and \"No ban! No wall!\"\n\nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n\nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters.\n\n\"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said.\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \"What's happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\"\n\nAirport arrests \n\nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n\nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \"President Trump's new Muslim ban.\"\n\nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US.\n\nThat move limited part of President Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night.\n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington.\n\n\"This executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\" he said in a statement.\n\nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \"Portland coffee comes from Yemen,\" one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list.\n\nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \"hashtag activist\" but felt compelled to protest at the airport.\n\n\"This was the last straw,\" she said of Trump's policies. \"We're all immigrants.\"\n\nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago.\n\nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey.\n\nTM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

His move has caused protests at US airports, with thousands showing support for the refugees and visitors banned from the seven countries. \n MORE THAN A MILLION IN THE UAE  \nAnd while even though the UAE isn\u2019t on the list, many of the people living in the UAE will be affected. \n \nIt\u2019s unclear exactly how many people from these seven countries are living in the UAE because not many official statistics that list the population by nationality are released in the UAE, but it\u2019s likely that there are around 1.1 million people from these countries living here.  \n \nIt\u2019s estimated that there are around  240,000 Syrians living in the UAE ,  around 150,000 Iraqis ,  500,000 Iranians ,  90,000 Yemenis ,  80,000 Sudanese ,  50,000 Somalis  and a few thousand Libyans.  \n \nALSO READ \n*Amazing pictures of a busy church mass in Dubai* \n*This Indian billionaire just bailed 132 debt-ridden expats out of jail* \n \nWhat we do know for sure is that there are currently more than five million Arabic speakers living in the UAE \u2013 and only around one million of those are Emirati. So it\u2019s safe to say that the United Arab Emirates\u2019 resident population is a diverse picture of the Arabic-speaking world.  \n \nWhen Trump announced the ruling it was effective immediately, meaning those en route to the States with valid visas were detained on arrival or stopped at international airports.  However, US Judge Ann Donnelly, made an emergency ruling preventing the removal of people already in the US at the time as she deemed there was a risk of \u201csubstantial and irreparable injury\u201d to them. Her ruling will only affect those who landed at US airports Friday evening and Saturday, after Trump signed the order, and have valid visas. \n WHAT ABOUT THOSE ON GCC PASSPORTS?  \nWell, while no GCC countries are on the \u2018banned\u2019 list \u2013 Donald Trump did say vetting will be \u201cextreme\u201d in all cases. \n \nIn an interview with  ABC News  on Wednesday, Trump was asked, \u201cLet me ask you about some of the countries that won\u2019t be on the list, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia. Why are we going to allow people to come into this country.\u201d \n \nTo this, Trump replied, \u201cYou\u2019re going to see \u2013 you\u2019re going to see. We\u2019re going to have extreme vetting in all cases. And I mean extreme. And we\u2019re not letting people in if we think there\u2019s even a little chance of some problem.\u201d \n \nPLUS \n*British celebrity receives hate over picture taken in Dubai mosque* \n*The UAE\u2019s world-first tolerance charter* \n \n\u201cFor other countries we\u2019re gonna have extreme vetting. It\u2019s going to be very hard to come in. Right now it\u2019s very easy to come in. It\u2019s gonna be very, very hard. I don\u2019t want terror in this country.

A natural courtship commences and each decision they make as a couple is explored and examined in a very unusual and unorthodox presentation. The story is told in fragments with each fragment being an alternate reality unto itself. Stay with me kids; this story deals with some heavy themes. \n \nMarianne is a scientist at Cambridge University who happens to deal with quantum mechanics. While that may sound  a bit too Star Trek for some of you, this is a topic to which I have personally have given much thought. In theory, every decision you make creates an alternate reality. Think of how many decisions (large and small ) you make every day. Compound that by every year of your life and it is mind-boggling how many infinite  possibilities your life could have taken over time. (Trust me people: I am insanely jealous of the Jim who is living in the reality where a certain pant-suited leader got elected.) \n \nPlaywright Nick Payne does an amazing job tackling this heady concept by showing the audience all the various paths a relationship can possibly take over time. There is the birth (and death) of their budding relationship, a myriad of emotional struggles, and then there is a life-threatening illness that culminates in gut-wrenching climax. To say I was not expecting the last aspect of the story is an understatement. But when it came, it knocked the wind out of my chest. I feel that I have already given too much of the story away, but I wanted to make sure you know to emotionally prepare for this production.  Maybe I am personally too close to the subject, but I felt every ounce of Marianne\u2019s pain the last half of the story. Any story that can make my dead black heart actually  feel  something is quite remarkable. \n \nMy hat is tipped to director Steven Woolf. Each aspect of this production was visually arresting and extremely well thought-out. From the dozens of blocking cues to giving the subject of the story the needed emotional weight, to creating a moment using sign language, every facet of this production is exquisite. \n \nBoth Adair and Gilde worked extremely well together in creating some tangible emotional moments onstage. Their passion as they embraced was palpable which makes sense seeing how the two thespians are married in real life. That fact aside, these two talented actors should be commended for tackling such a complex and schizophrenic story while making it look like they have been doing it for years. Their ability to turn on (and off) their emotions at a moment\u2019s notice is extraordinary. This play is a real testament to their ability to be emotionally naked on a bare stage. Both actors should be commended for turning in emotionally real and convincing performances. \n \nSo now you have a chance to make your own reality. Will you stay home to Netflix and chill, or will you expand your cultural horizons and get your butt to The Repertory Theatre of St. Louis and witness some remarkable theatre? The correct choice is obvious: Visit www.respstl.org and grab your tickets to this unique and wonderful production before other people buy them all up and make your choice for you.

The backing of both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 including Sen. Keith Perry, R-Gainesville \u2014 is a welcome development that hopefully leads to lawmakers continuing to work across the aisle on what should really be a nonpartisan issue.\n\nPerry previously served in the Florida House and was elected to the Senate after a campaign that featured fracking as a central issue. He received criticism in the campaign for voting for a bill last year that would have put just a temporary moratorium on fracking, so he gets credit for listening to concerns and now supporting an outright ban.\n\nLast year\u2019s legislation would have allowed fracking following a study by the state Department of Environmental Protection. Given the DEP\u2019s failure to protect water quality under Gov. Rick Scott, environmental advocates were rightly worried it would have provided a welcome mat for fracking and also kept secret the chemicals used in the process.\n\nThe newly introduced measure, SB 442, which would put an outright ban on fracking and other \u201cadvancement well stimulation\u201d methods. Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves forcing a mixture of water, chemicals and sand into the ground at high pressure to extract oil or gas. The chemicals used in the process have been linked to cancer and other serious health problems.\n\nFlorida\u2019s karst geology makes it particularly prone to the dangers of fracking. There is no reason to risk poisoning the aquifer that supplies our drinking water and feeds our region's natural springs.\n\nWhile fracking presents a potential threat to these resources, they are already being polluted by current practices. Last year\u2019s toxic algae blooms on the Indian River Lagoon received headlines but pollution can also be seen on an ongoing basis in waterways across Florida and in springs and off beaches that attract tourists to the state.\n\nState lawmakers had a chance to do something about the problem with a massive water bill passed last year. Instead, they allowed agricultural polluters to continue to follow voluntary best management practices that have been unsuccessful in reversing the damage done to springs and other water resources.\n\nCertainly other pollution sources such as septic tanks and fertilized lawns share blame for water pollution. State lawmakers need to do more to address these threats as well as excessive groundwater pumping, instead of allowing an even bigger crisis to happen.\n\nAmendment 1, the conservation initiative overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2014, should be funding the land acquisition need to protect environmentally sensitive areas. Lawmakers must ensure the money is dedicated to that purpose this session and not paying for salaries and other ordinary agency expenses, as has been done in the past.\n\nThe state DEP\u2019s recent track record includes new standards that allow more cancer-causing chemicals in waterways and initially not notifying the public about a massive sinkhole contaminating groundwater in Polk County. With the recent resignation of the DEP director, lawmakers need to demand the new leadership takes a different course.\n\nA fracking ban is a step in the right direction, stopping the practice before it really gets started in our state. Lawmakers should pass to ban while also working to address the threats to our groundwater that aren\u2019t so theoretical.\n\n\u2014 This editorial was written by Gainesville Sun opinion editor Nathan Crabbe and represents the opinion of The Sun's editorial board.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Editorial: Fracking ban is a good start","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Alachua","zipCode":"32614","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Gainesville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Gainesville Sun","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169667333","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"25"},"name":"Gainesville Sun","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gainesville.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201804576","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.gainesville.com/storyimage/LK/20170129/OPINION/170128299/AR/0/AR-170128299.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Dan\u2019s granddaughter, Kathy Rooney, had a map that we had used for a walking tour that was as quick as it was cold, and now we were settling in and passing old photos around our pints.\n\nThere was one with Dan in front of his bar circa 1916, the only hatless man among a half-dozen gents who were posing so casually they seemed to be trying to out-jaunty each other. The front of the Rooney bar was festooned with flags, though nobody can be sure now what they were celebrating, and Dan has his hands on the shoulders of his fifth son, Vince, then a grade schooler.\n\nPittsburghers might know Vince -- whom everyone called \u201cDuke\u2019\u2019 -- better as Art Rooney\u2019s younger brother. It was out of their father\u2019s bar that the eldest of six boisterous brothers and two sisters ventured out to play baseball, box, shoot craps and eventually start a sandlot football team that would evolve into the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nMy table mates knew the Steelers founder as Uncle Art. They knew Vince as \u201cDaddy.\u2019\u2019 Vince and his wife, Anne, would have seven children. Kathy is the youngest, and two of her older brothers, Jamie and Tom, were with us along with Tom\u2019s son, Josh.\n\nOur walking tour had included a majestic view of the parking lot across Martindale Street from the D.L. Clark Building, because now we were looking at a 1915 photo of a firehouse that once stood there.\n\nThat Hope Fire Station at the foot of Monument Hill doubled as the locker room for the Hope Harvey football team, the team Art Rooney ran, and also ran for, while he was still in high school. A hundred years ago, the Hope Harvey boys played in Exposition Park, the stadium the Pirates had abandoned for Forbes Field in 1909.\n\nExpo Park, where the first World Series was played in 1903, stood just west of where PNC Park is now. In fact, the office building where I\u2019m typing this would have been in Expo Park\u2019s right field.\n\nSo why am I telling you all this? Because, as a fellow once said, history doesn\u2019t repeat itself -- it stutters.\n\nThe neighborhood those Rooneys knew when they lived above the family bar is long gone. Known only as \u201cThe Ward\u2019\u2019 to generations of North Siders who lived there, the entire neighborhood was leveled in the 1960s to make way for the opening of Three Rivers Stadium and the obligatory sea of parking surrounding it.\n\nThat stadium was blown up 16 years ago. PNC Park and Heinz Field rose on either side, and some of the old street grid was brought back, too, with Stage AE, office buildings, hotels, restaurants and bars filling in along the new and old streets.\n\nMillions now venture each year to what has been relabeled \u201cThe North Shore\u2019\u2019 -- some of those millions being the same person a dozen times or more -- but it\u2019s not a real neighborhood. The area is exponentially livelier than it was in the Three Rivers era, but working there can make you feel like you\u2019re just \u201cthe backdrop for other people\u2019s good times,\u2019\u2019 as my colleague Chris Potter put it.\n\nApartments are supposed to go up between the stadiums in 2018, but one high rise won\u2019t make a neighborhood. Still it\u2019s a sign of progress to see people flocking to the North Side when there is no game. Southern Tier Brewing, with roots in western New York, began drawing crowds last week with the promise of no more than beer and fellowship, just as Dan Rooney\u2019s Cafe & Bar had.\n\nWhen I asked our waitress what was the closest thing the place had to a Guinness, she suggested the 2XStout. It was very good but, after reading the description, I asked Jamie Rooney what his grandfather might have said to a customer who asked for something \u201crich, caramel and roasty, with high residual sweetness\u201d?\n\n\u201cWhy, you lob,\u201d Mr. Rooney said, channeling his grandfather\u2019s voice.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what that means, but I\u2019m sure you could hear it only in a real neighborhood bar. So I had another and then walked up the hill home, passing the ghosts of a fire house and an ancient bar along the way.\n\nBrian O\u2019Neill: boneill@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1947 or on Twitter @brotheroneill","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Brian O'Neill / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - Pittsburgh Steelers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Brian O'Neill: The ghosts of a trendy neighborhood","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Allegheny","zipCode":"15222","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Pittsburgh","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169658449","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3543"},"name":"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.post-gazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201804779","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.post-gazette.com/image/2017/01/29/720x_q90_cMC_z_ca0,77,720,614/20170127brianoneillcolumn.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

This call, published in the Israeli media last week, carries a fascinating discovery; a triangle-shaped pendant belonging to a Jewish girl was found at the site of Sobibor death camp, in the then-Nazi occupied Poland. \n \nFor the last decade, Israeli, Polish and Dutch archeologists have been carrying an archeological dig at Sobibor, discovering the location of what used to be the gas chambers, with innumerous personal items including wedding rings and medallions carved with their owners\u2019 names. These items are the sole remains and the \u201ctomb stone\u201d of those victims burnt into ashes. \n \nThe pendant is similar to that of Holocaust diarist Anna Frank, with exactly the same carving of the word Frankfurt and the inscription MAZAL \u2013 TOV in Hebrew, with the date July 3, 1929, the Hebrew letter HE \u201cה\u201d representing God\u2019s name, surrounded by three stars of David. \n \nAccording to Holocaust victims\u2019 data base, the pendant might have belonged to Karoline Cohn who was born July 3, 1929 in Frankfurt and deported to the Minsk Ghetto in 1941. Cohn\u2019s fate afterwards is unknown. \n \nThe dig was carried out where the victims were ordered to get undressed and had their heads shaved before being forced to walk along the \u201cRoad to Heaven\u201d, the terrible name Nazis gave to the gas chambers path. \n \nProf. Yisrael Gutman, a leading Holocaust researcher, once said: \u201cThe Shoah (Holocaust) refuses to become History\u201d. Seventy years later, anti-Semitism still exists. Israel is concerned with anti-Semitic incidents in Europe, including attacks on synagogues, physical attacks on Jews and the rise of far right parties and racist anti-Semitic rhetoric. \n \nIn November 2005, 60 years after the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps, the UN Assembly adopted the historic resolution 60/7, designating January 27 as the annual International Day of Commemoration in Memory of the Holocaust Victims. Authored by Israel and the countries that liberated the camps, co-sponsored by many countries, including Cyprus, and approved unanimously, it reaffirms that the Holocaust, which resulted in the murder of 6 million Jews and members of other minorities, will forever be a warning to all people of the danger of hatred, bigotry and racism. \n \nPeople may ask why the international community should regard the Holocaust of the Jewish people as an unprecedented episode in history, since atrocities and genocide took place before and, unfortunately, still happen today around the world. It is the evil, systematic, \u201cscientific\u201d mass murder of any person with Jewish roots aiming to extinguish a whole nation, which makes it a universal trauma. \n \nThe UN resolution urges member states to develop educational programmes, to help prevent future acts of Genocide, to reject denial of the Holocaust, and to condemn all manifestations of religious intolerance, harassment or violence against persons or communities, based on ethnic origin or religious belief. The Israeli Embassy in Cyprus collaborates with the Ministry of Education to bequeath the lesson of the Holocaust to the young generation. Obviously, moral education rests also on political, economic and social leaders who share a common responsibility for shaping moral norms and ethical standards, and we welcome both statements and actions taken to assure that the lesson is learned. \n \nAuschwitz survivor, author Primo Levi warned: It happened. Therefore, it can happen again. All of us today should commit to: \u2018Never Again\u2019. \n \n*Ambassador of Israel to Cyprus","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Cyprus news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Who knows Karoline Cohn?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"CY","country":"Cyprus"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Cyprus Weekly","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"245348327","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"The Cyprus Weekly","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.incyprus.com.cy"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201805057","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:58Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Here are five excellent camping options that are driving distance from Dubai\u2026  White Sands Beach  \nPerfect for: Beach-loving campers \n \nPhoto: Pete Maloney \n  \nThe lowdown: White Sands Beach isn\u2019t an official area, but rather a nickname given to a stretch of coastline in Oman located between Fins and Wadi Shab. We won\u2019t lie \u2013 it\u2019s a long drive, but well worth it to pitch your tent on a cliff above an empty sandy beach and fall asleep to the sound of the waves. Plus, the remote nature of the area means you hopefully won\u2019t have to share your spot with many other campers. \n \nThings to do in the area: For water babies, it\u2019s the perfect camping spot. Bring your snorkels and paddleboards for exploring the coastline (keep an eye out for sea urchins near the beach though). Be sure to visit Wadi Shab just a short drive away, where you can hike through the dramatic wadis and cool off by diving into the deep, emerald green pools. \n \nDifficulty rating: 3/5.  Medium. It\u2019s not a complicated route, but the long drive is not one you\u2019d want to take alone. \n \n4×4 needed? Not essential, but recommended. \n \nTime: Seven hours \n \nDirections from Dubai: Drive towards Muscat but just before you get to the city, get on the new Muscat Expressway. Head in the direction of Sur and follow the coastline until you find a good spot. \n \n*ALSO READ: Want a thrilling weekend or a chill one? 22 things to do, whatever your mood* \n Liwa  \nPerfect for: Desert adventurers and Star Wars fans \n \nPhoto: Pete Maloney \n  \nThe lowdown:  It\u2019s been nearly a year since Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens hit our screens, and we\u2019re still excited at the prospect of visiting one of the filming locations. Liwa is located in the Empty Quarter, or Rub Al Khali, the largest sand desert in the world. We can\u2019t guarantee that you\u2019ll find an abandoned Millennium Falcon, but you will experience incredible (and massive) sand dunes, miles of wilderness and some of the brightest starry nights you\u2019ll ever see in the UAE. \n \nThings to do in the area:  We recommend renting a couple of fat bikes beforehand (you can pick one up from Adventure HQ for Dhs150 per day): there\u2019s nothing better than zipping across the dunes on their puffy tyres, especially as the sun is setting. Experienced off-roaders will have a blast doing a bit of dune bashing, but keep in mind that this is not an easy area to get out of if you get into trouble: carry plenty of food and water, and don\u2019t travel in convoys of less than three 4x4s, just in case someone needs towing. \n \nDifficulty rating:   4/5.  Medium to hard. It\u2019s relatively simple to find, but you\u2019ll need some off-roading skills if you want to head off the beaten path and into the dunes. It\u2019s not one for beginners \u2013 we recommend travelling with an experienced group. \n \n4×4 needed?  Essential  \n \nTime:  Four hours \n \nDirections from Dubai:  Drive from Dubai to Abu Dhabi, take the E11, turn on to E65 to Emirates National Auto Museum. Keep following the E65 until you see the sign to Qasr Al Sarab. Ignore it \u2013 follow the road right instead. \n Al Qudra Lakes  \nPerfect for: Beginners \n \n\n \nThe lowdown:  Al Qudra Lakes is the ideal location if you\u2019re new to camping in the UAE, or just looking for a low-key break from the city that won\u2019t require a huge amount of effort. You won\u2019t need a 4×4 to reach these picturesque lakes, and the area is within half an hour\u2019s drive of the city. Keep in mind that because it\u2019s so easily accessible, it\u2019s popular with   weekend warriors. \n \nThings to do in the area:  Al Qudra Lakes might be manmade but it\u2019s still a picturesque slice of greenery, with plenty of trees and wildlife, especially birds, to be spotted in and around the water. If you\u2019re feeling sporty you could also go for a bike around the nearby Al Qudra Cycle Track, where you might also spot wild oryx and gazelle (rent a bike from the Trek store). If the great outdoors get too much for you, there\u2019s always Bab Al Shams Resort And Spa nearby for a little R&R. It\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll need it though, as there are plenty of amenities in the area. \n \nDifficulty rating: 1/5.  An easy to reach spot with minimal off-roading. \n \n4×4 needed?  No \n \nTime: Half an hour \n \nDirections from Dubai: Take Hessa Street to the start of Al Qudra Cycle Track, turn left, turn right and take the off-road track. Follow it until you find a good spot. \n Fossil Rock, Sharjah  \nPerfect for:  Day trippers and desert newbies \n \n\n \nThe lowdown:  Fossil Rock is one of the most popular hangout spots for Dubai\u2019s weekend warriors, from dune bashers and dune buggy riders to trail runners. The surrounding dunes are the perfect location to set up camp, especially for large groups who don\u2019t mind a bit of noise and excitement. It\u2019s also close enough to civilisation that newbies can feel comfortable knowing their home comforts are not too far away. \n \nThings to see and do: This is one of the best places in the UAE for a spot of dune bashing, but we recommend it for experienced off-roaders only. The Camel Rock nearby is also worth a visit, as is Big Red, a huge red dune that\u2019s popular with dune buggying daredevils. \n \nDifficulty rating: 2/5.  E asy to medium \u2013 it\u2019s simple to get to, but requires some off-roading skills. \n \n4×4 needed?  Essential for navigating the sand dunes. \n \nTime:  One hour \n \nDirections from Dubai:  Take the 611 towards Sharjah. Turn right onto the Sharjah-Kalba Road, then turn right again at the big junction surrounded by pylons. \n Jebel Shams, Oman  \nPerfect for: Outdoor explorers \n \nPhoto: Pete Maloney \n  \nThe lowdown:  If you\u2019ve never been to Oman before you need to add Jebel Shams to your bucket list. Also known as the \u2018Grand Canyon Of Oman\u2019, the scenery here is breathtaking \u2013 rugged mountains, towering cliffs and the canyon itself. There\u2019s an official campsite near the start of the hike, but bear in mind that temperatures are likely to be lower than you\u2019re used to in Dubai. \n \nThings to do: The main attraction of Jebel Shams is the balcony walk inside the canyon itself. Despite the awe-inspiring scenery, the single-track hike itself is actually very easy and relatively flat. Out and back takes about an hour \u2013 there\u2019s an old, historic mud village at the end of the track where you can take a break to have a bite. We also recommend a drive to nearby Misfat Al Abriyeen, an old traditional village that\u2019s home to stunning architecture and a lush date plantation. \n \nDifficulty ratin g:  3/5.   Medium. It\u2019s a popular tourist site, but the drive is long. \n \n4×4 needed?  Not essential, but highly recommended to navigate some of the hills. \n \nTime:  Five hours \n \nDirections from Dubai:  Drive to Al Ain and through the border. Don\u2019t forget your passport. Head south towards Nizwa and drive through Ibri and Bala. \n \n\u2013 For more about Dubai straight to your newsfeed, follow us on Facebook. \n  \n YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE  \n     Active   \nAll along this striking coastline, rugged rock faces drop directly into the sea, earning the moniker the Fjords of Musandam. \n      Active   \nThe Danat Jebel Dhanna Resort, near Sir Bani Yas Island, is one of several hotels in the area that organises expeditions. \n      Active   \nWhat\u2019s On tells you the best places to run in Dubai, featuring running tracks in Dubai at Al Barsha Park, Bay Avenue Park, JBR The Beach and Jumeirah Corniche. \n      Active   \nNext to the Al Qudra cycling track, a cluster of manmade lakes \u2013 home to hundreds of exotic birds \u2013 is waiting to be explored.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Stacey Siebritz"},"topics":[{"name":"United Arab Emirates news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Dubai news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Oman news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Five amazing places to camp in the UAE and beyond","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"What's On Dubai","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"456250718","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"What's On Dubai","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://whatson.ae"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.facebook.com/WhatsOnDubai"],"sequenceId":"695201814676","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 44 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lancaster","zipCode":"17603","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169674001","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"WGAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201815593","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They started out playing together in Compton, hardly a hotbed for tennis, with their father Richard and mother Oracene as coach and mentor. And they still practice and travel together around the world. \n \nThey met for the first time at a major at Melbourne Park in 1998 \u2014 Venus won that one. In 2003, when the younger of the Williams siblings completed her \u201cSerena Slam\u201d of four consecutive titles, Venus was on the other side of the net. She didn\u2019t reach another Australian final for 14 years. \n \nWhen Serena sat on the court, holding both arms up to celebrate on Saturday, Venus walked over to her sister\u2019s side of the net for a hug. \n \n\u201cThis was a tough one,\u201d Serena said. \u201cI really would like to take this moment to congratulate Venus, she\u2019s an amazing person \u2014 she\u2019s my inspiration. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I would be at 23 without her \u2014 there\u2019s no way I would be at one without her. Thank you Venus for inspiring me to be the best player I can be and inspiring me to work hard.\u201d \n \nAsked if it felt awkward to be on the receiving end of so many losses to her sister, the 36-year-old Venus didn\u2019t flinch. \n \n\u201cNo, because I guess I\u2019ve been here before,\u201d she said. \u201cI really enjoy seeing the name Williams on the trophy. This is a beautiful thing.\u201d \n \nVenus won the last of her seven majors in 2008 at Wimbledon. She didn\u2019t make the second week of a major for a few years as she came to terms with an energy-sapping illness after being diagnosed with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome in 2011. And she only made it back to the semifinals last year at Wimbledon. \n \nAnother shot at a first Australian Open title was a sign of progress, she said. \n \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly where I want to be standing during these Grand Slams, is on finals day, having an opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the highlight of all this, is to be in that moment.\u201d \n \nSerena Williams, meanwhile, enjoyed the fact she made history in Melbourne. Only Margaret Court, with 24, is in front of her in terms of overall Grand Slam singles titles, although the Australian great won 13 of her Grand Slams before the Open era began in 1968. \n \n\u201cMy first Grand Slam started here, and getting to 23 here, but playing Venus, it\u2019s stuff that legends are made of,\u201d Serena said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have written a better story.\u201d \n \nThe match didn\u2019t live up to its classic billing, with nerves and tension causing uncharacteristic mistakes and unforced errors, with four consecutive service breaks before Venus finally held for a 3-2 lead in the first set. That included a game when Serena had game point but served back-to-back double-faults and three in all to give up the break. \n \nThere were six service breaks in total. Both players were relatively subdued, except when Serena smashed her racket in the third game. \n \nAfter the fourth game, however, Serena Williams didn\u2019t face another break point in the 1-hour, 22-minute match. \n \n\u201cSerena Williams, that\u2019s my little sister,\u201d Venus said. \u201cI have been right there with you. Some of them I have lost right there against you. It\u2019s been an awesome thing, your win has always been my win.\u201d \n \nIn terms of total years, it was the oldest Grand Slam women\u2019s final in the Open era \u2014 the Williams sisters combining for 71 years, 11 months. \n \nRoger Federer will be aiming to increase his all-time men\u2019s record to 18 when he takes on 14-time major winner Rafael Nadal on Sunday, completing the singles finals lineup of all 30-somethings. \n \nBob and Mike Bryan missed out on a doubles record, losing the final 7-5, 7-5 to Henri Kontinen of Finland and John Peers of Australia. \n \nThe third-seeded twins were trying to win their 17th Grand Slam title, which would have tied them with John Newcombe. \n \nSpeaking of records, Serena got a little bit superstitious Down Under, and hadn\u2019t wanted to talk about the No. 23 until she got it. \n \nNow there\u2019s a limited-edition racket \u2014 23 of them to be released \u2014 and some custom-made shoes sent by former NBA great Jordan. It had Jordan\u2019s usual jersey number No. 23 stamped on the heel, helping to provide some synchronicity for the numbers involved.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"John Pye The"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena Williams sets major record with win over Venus","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Monterey","zipCode":"93940","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Monterey","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Monterey Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169656828","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"171"},"name":"Monterey Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.montereyherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201815770","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.montereyherald.com/storyimage/NF/20170128/SPORTS/170129725/AR/0/AR-170129725.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

On his first full day in office, Attorney General Josh Shapiro signed a new code of ethics and invited his 800-some employees, covering all job classifications, to do the same. By Wednesday, a week later, all had done so.\n\nSigning was voluntary, according to Mr. Shapiro\u2019s office. But was the 100 percent participation rate a surprise? No. Did the employees believe they had a choice? Probably not. \n\nMr. Shapiro has pledged his integrity to the people of Pennsylvania and expects those working for him \u2014 for the citizens, really \u2014 to do the same. The pact signaled a fresh start for an office that lurched from one controversy to the next under former AG Kathleen Kane, whose term was truncated by her conviction on perjury and other charges related to the leak of grand jury information about a political enemy.\n\nJust paragraphs long, Mr. Shapiro\u2019s ethics code pointedly requires the \u201csafeguarding of all confidential information.\u201d It also commits the signers to putting the commonwealth\u2019s interest above their own, avoiding discrimination of all kinds and \u201cserving as a public employee with integrity, trustworthiness and professionalism.\u201d On the office\u2019s website is a short video of Mr. Shapiro signing the code and saying he never again wants people to have to doubt the office\u2019s professionalism.\n\nThe ethics code was partly symbolic; employees already could be fired for certain kinds of unethical behavior. Yet it was a thoughtful way for Mr. Shapiro to begin his tenure and to help the office to break with the past. He also brought in a new top aide \u2014 Eric Fillman, the office\u2019s first chief integrity officer \u2014 to enforce the cultural reset.\n\nMr. Fillman\u2019s work will include holding ethics training sessions, advising employees and officials on potential conflicts, and making sure employees maintain the required professional certifications and comply with continuing education requirements.

In this installment, we\u2019re going a bit further back to look at one of the more famous political debacles involving former taoiseach Bertie Ahern. \n \nHere\u2019s how plans for a west Dublin sports centre, popularly referred to by its nickname the \u2019Bertie Bowl\u2019, turned into a farce that would ultimately cost taxpayers tens of millions by the time it was officially scrapped. \n \nWhat is it? \n \nAhern\u2019s Fianna Fáil government pushed ahead with many big-ticket projects around the time of the Celtic Tiger, but few were as close to the then-taoiseach\u2019s heart as the Bertie Bowl. \n \nOfficially titled Stadium Ireland, the idea was to build a huge sports campus in Abbottstown in west Dublin on a 500-acre plot of land. \n \nA range of sports facilities were to be included, from a 15,000-seat indoor arena, several sports halls and tennis courts, to a sports science and medical centre. \n \nAn aquatic centre with a 50m pool was later added to this already ambitious list, as well as a golf academy, velodrome and offices for sports organisations. \n \nBut the flagship feature of the Bertie Bowl was to be a 65,000 all-seat stadium to replace Lansdowne Road. At the time, the old Lansdowne Road ground, which hosted both international soccer and rugby matches, was in a dilapidated state. \n \nThere had been plans to replace it with a 45,000 all-seat stadium in Saggart, south Dublin, named after the then-sponsors of the Irish football team, Eircom. However, the government abandoned this idea in favour of Stadium Ireland. \n \nAhern and former sports minister Jim McDaid (centre)  Source: Joey Cleary/RollingNews.ie \n \nMany of Ahern\u2019s opponents dismissed the stadium as a vanity project for the sports-mad, Dublin-born taoiseach. Former Labour minister Pat Rabitte was credited by the Guardian as coining the term \u2018Bertie Bowl\u2019, a label which stuck for the controversial project. \n \nWhen was it first suggested? \n \nOne of the first serious feasibility studies for the project was carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 1999. \n \nWhat happened? \n \nThe government committed to backing the Bertie Bowl in 1999, but a host of problems meant that it never saw the light of day. The major one was that cost estimates were all over the place. \n \nIt was first thought that the scheme would cost about IR£280 million. Paddy Teahon, the former top civil servant who was heading up the project, claimed that it would cost IR£350 million (\u20ac444 million at the time). \n \nA later report carried out by London engineering firm High Point Rendel and published in 2002 put the price closer to \u20ac900 million. \n \nWhen a few other factors, such as transport infrastructure costs, were allowed for, this jumped again to a potential bill of more than \u20ac1 billion. There was also a question as to the logic of building the stadium when Dublin already had Croke Park and Lansdowne Road. \n \nThe rising estimates spooked the Progressive Democrats, Fianna Fáil\u2019s coalition partner at the time. It looked likely that, at the very least, all the additional features at the ground, such as the 15,000-seat indoor arena, would end up being scrapped. \n \nFormer Progressive Democrats leader Mary Harney  Source: RollingNews.ie \n \nThere were still hopes in the IRFU and in government circles that the 65,000-seat centrepiece stadium could still go ahead after the report was published. \n  \nIn February 2002 the BBC quoted Sports Minister Jim McDaid as saying: \u201cAs long as Bertie Ahern is taoiseach, the dream of having this stadium here in this country will be a reality.\u201d \n  \nFurther complicating matters was the fact that Ireland and Scotland had launched a joint bid to host the 2008 European soccer championships. \n \nStadium Ireland was a key part of the bid, and Scottish officials were still expressing confidence that the stadium would be finished up until February 2002. But their hopes were misplaced as it became clear that the project would simply cost too much to build. \n \nThe National Aquatic centre did eventually get off the ground, although this too was fraught with controversy. It was built at a cost of \u20ac74 million, more than double initial estimates. \n \nThe government instead decided to redevelop Lansdowne Road as what is now the Aviva Stadium, and plans to build the Bertie Bowl were shelved in September 2002. \n \nWhat\u2019s the latest? \n \nBertie Ahern was re-elected as taoiseach in 2002, but the stadium never became a reality. It receded from the public consciousness and was rarely reported on for the next few years or so. \n \nIn 2009, Fingal County Council granted planning permission to the National Sports Campus Development Authority to build a range of features on the former Bertie Bowl site. \n \nThe National Sports Campus in Abbotstown  Source: National Sports Campus Development Authority \n \nFacilities similar to many of those originally envisaged as part of the Stadium Ireland project, such as the national horse sports arena and high performance training facilities for a range of disciplines, did end up going ahead, while others, such as a velodrome, are in the works. \n \nHowever, a notable absentee is the Bertie Bowl itself, which looks dead and buried. \n \nIt later emerged in private documents published by the Mahon Tribunal that Ahern had dismissed plans for the government to part-fund the construction of a stadium in Neilstown, Clondalkin, five years before floating his own vision for the Bertie Bowl. \n \nIt also later became clear just how close the project was to the former taoiseach\u2019s heart. On his last day in the Dáil in January 2011, Ahern was asked by RTÉ if he had any regrets. \n \nVideo (http://www.youtube.com/watch=nYTa81JdDfo&t=) \n \n[embedded content] \n Source: RTÉ - IRELAND\u2019S NATIONAL PUBLIC SERVICE MEDIA /YouTube  \nAt that time, the country was in recession and the banks were in crisis, both issues which Ahern did namecheck. However, the Dubliner surprised many when he lamented the failure to go ahead with the Bertie Bowl. \n  \n\u201cI still think we didn\u2019t get a proper national infrastructure stadium. It\u2019s an achievement I tried hard to do, but didn\u2019t get,\u201d he said. \n  \nA little over a year later, it emerged in the Public Accounts Committee that \u20ac43 million was spent on the never-built stadium for the repeatedly revised plans. \n \nCommittee chair John McGuinness remarked at the time: \u201cThere has been too much money wasted in the past without things being properly thought out.\u201d Good thing that would never happen again. \n \nWritten by Paul O\u2019Donoghue and posted on Fora.ie \n Take me to Fora  \nWritten by Fora Staff and posted on TheJournal.ie \n  Get the top business news from Fora delivered to your inbox:     \nGet breaking news from TheJournal.ie via Facebook. \nJust click Like.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Whatever happened to...

Senior Special Assistant, SSA, to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, in this interview, first wired on Channels Tv, explains that the outcome of the investigations, including the accidental air strikes on a civilian community in Borno State would be made public to forestall future occurrence.The interview was conducted before the President\u2019s vacation controversy. \n\nDo we have assurance from the Federal Government that the people who have fled their homes from Southern Kaduna can safely return? \n\nGovernment has intensified a lot of activities. As we speak now, there are ongoing efforts to establish two military battalions: one in Karsha and one in Zango-Kataf, and there is military surveillance undertaken by the air force. The army has moved and Mobile Police squadrons have been put in place. So, a lot of effort is being made. The humanitarian situation is also being looked at. The Federal Government, through NEMA, is working with Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency in order to bring relief to displaced persons. \n\nWhat was reported was that groups and public spirited individuals are the ones that give victims support in primary schools, there is no mention of NEMA. \n\nI can assure you that NEMA is doing quite a lot but that isn\u2019t to say that people should not help. This is Nigeria and this is how we have cared for one another in all crisis situations if you compare what is going in Southern Kaduna with what is going on in the North-East. A lot of humanitarian effort is being driven by communities. As a matter of fact, 80 percent of displaced persons are found in communities and are being accommodated by members of communities not in IDP camps. So, we have a way of caring for one another but I can assure that it was on the directive of the President that NEMA went to Southern Kaduna. \n\nIt is unclear whether or not the battalion has helped in getting those that perpetrate this evil. Once in a week now, we have had sporadic attacks even after security men had been deployed. \n\nThings are calming down. It would be an assumption to think that the crisis will just go away with the wave of the hand. It will take some time to get those that perpetrate the criminality but, by and large, the things put in place by the Federal Government are having an effect. \n\nMany people wanted security agents to go into the bush because they felt that was where the murderers were and they also felt it was difficult for them to go to their farm and they were saying that the bulk of the security men were always staying in town and on the road which wasn\u2019t where the attacks were. \n\nWell, again, we often make mistakes which is that we leave matters of security to the police and the army and there is enormous responsibility on us as members of our communities. Let me give an example, information just coming out of Borno is that the chairman of a certain local government has been found complicit in Boko Haram attacks and he is being shielded by community members. This is not how it should be because we as members of the community have our own duty; if we leave these things to the police, army, we don\u2019t have enough police men to put everywhere in this country. Yes, I believe there is a lot to be done but communities mustn\u2019t push their own responsibility to the police in this crisis. \n\nThese people have already been traumatized, most of the attacks have been on their farmers. In some instances, villages are entered and ransacked and people are killed or maimed as the case maybe. They rely on security agencies knowing that they are unarmed and most of the attackers come in fully armed and prepared to create maximum damage and the security agents aren\u2019t looking in the areas they want them to look. Do you still say that they are shying from their responsibility? \n\nTo be honest with you, we must begin to look beyond the police and the army in solving a crisis like the one in Southern Kaduna. See the communities where lives have been destroyed. Look at the interesting thing that has evolved out of Plateau State. Plateau was the epicenter of crisis for some time and the community seized these elements with both hands. Southern Kaduna hasn\u2019t been like this; a story was told of one Fulani man living in Southern Kaduna and was so trustful of his neighbour. The Fulani, being a Muslim and his neighbour, a Christian, left behind his child with this neighbour. The neighbour looked for a Muslim school for the child to be taught because his children don\u2019t go to that school. In fact, the Fulani man went and never really came back to that community but this Southern Kaduna man raised this child as a Muslim in the choice of his own parents until the young man graduated from the university before he reunited with his family. These are communities that have lived with one another for a long time. A lot has happened. So, many of the things that are going on there is a lot of criminality. There is a lot of injustice that needs to be corrected, politics is also coming in and, when politics and security mix, you have problems. \n\nWhat precisely is going on in Kaduna? \n\nWell, so many things have gone wrong including, as I said, the breakdown of society and that really has to be rebuilt. Security has been intensive there but, as I said earlier, that alone isn\u2019t going to solve the problem. Beyond this, I think there is also a lot to worry about, concerning politics and religiousity and even media coverage of the crisis in Southern Kaduna. I think it needs to be more enlightened, balanced and evenly handled. It is a crisis where communities are fighting one another and when you read media reports, it is just one side of the story of the victims that is being told. There are Muslims, there are Christians and they kill each other but people report like there is only one part of the community suffering all of this and that is the misinterpretation of the facts. Politics, like I said, has a role in all of these things. Don\u2019t forget that Southern Kaduna is the only PDP senatorial district in the entire North-West and that has implications for the way politics is run. There is a lot of interest; the PDP is interested and is assuming someone wants to use force to capture this place. The PDP, the media and everyone is throwing things into this thing. So, we have to de-escalate by ensuring balanced media reports, depoliticise the situation and sermornization of some of the religious leaders. We have seen lately, for instance, there have been this video going viral all over the country that people should be killed. \n\nWho is saying that? \n\nUnfortunately the video isn\u2019t branded, the name isn\u2019t there but it is very clear it is someone who kept asking for the killing and the be-heading. This country doesn\u2019t deserve this and I have the sense that this person has a lot of explanation to do. \n\nOn the point made by the Kaduna governor that the people were taking a revenge on 2011 elections crisis/compensation of victims \u2026 \n\nPeople talk about Fulani settlers, I don\u2019t know why anybody is called a settler in his own country but I just illustrated a story of a Fulani man who left his son with his neighbour. These are people who have lived in these places for generations herding their cattle and the so-called natives who believe they are the oldest in there as long history can remember call them settlers. I think the point the governor of Kaduna has tried to make all along is that this crisis is a long standing one and he mentioned that more than 10,000 lives have been lost and that the problem has continued to perpetuate itself because people are not being punished for their roles in previous crisis. We have had investigation upon investigation, report upon report to successive administrations in Kaduna. What can anybody do about it? Well, he says this time that it would be different, that people would be brought to trial and they are already making arrest and we hope that will help to stop the crisis. \n\nBut people believe that even if the crisis between communities, how come some communities seem better armed than others? Some people feel there is more to this than meets the eye and some people are alleging conspiracy theory and Southern Kaduna isn\u2019t the only ones having crisis. From Taraba to Yobe, you have pockets of crisis, even at some point, Nassarawa had to contend with a crisis of this nature. Do we have security intelligence mapping that says precisely what is going on and affecting these communities and this is the solution they are proposing? \n\nI can say that there is this massive conspiracy that you are leading to whether it is from home or abroad or whatever. One thing I know is that we have a problem because we have cattle herders who, by tradition, follow the green grass and, when they drive their cattle around looking for green grass, the cattle enter farmlands and eat crops and, when that happens, farmers fight back and, on the other hand also, you have cattle rustling which also has assumed a big dimension. Until recently nothing was done about it. So, when you snatch the cattle and you kill and eat up they will come back to take. \n\nAre you suggesting that farmers are also taking cattle? \n\nNumber of communities do this otherwise if there is no cattle rustling people won\u2019t be talking about it. This is why ongoing efforts seem to be like what you have in Benue coming out of Agatu last week, you have Nassarawa and Benue states coming together to carve out a terrain for cattle rearing. \n\nThe communities were resisting that move by the state government because they felt the wounds were just too fresh for them to forget in a hurry. \n\nWell, it isn\u2019t easy to suppress all of that but certainly that is the way to go. Even Anambra and Enugu and a number of states have seen solutions that are very bright that whenever a community steals cattle and they are able to trace, they are made to pay the cattle herders because they have stolen and, if the cattle rearers drive their cattle over their crops, they are also charged. So, there is a balance in the way it is done. \n\nBut in terms of the lives that have been lost\u2026 \n\nWell, lives have been lost and, like I said earlier, there is a conflict and these lives are lost on both sides and I think that media reports ought to be such that they reflect the losses on both sides otherwise we are not helping the crisis situation. \n\nInformation on the Southern Kaduna crisis the Catholic church has released indicates that over 808 lives have been lost as of the time they wrote their statement which the IG disputed but then we never got any figure from the authorities even though the governor of the state came out to say that since the crisis begin in Southern Kaduna over 20,000 lives have been lost. It is a huge number of people that lost their lives to this conflict that would have been resolved before now this something the federal government is giving serious thought to? \n\nIt is tragic and unfortunate that this happened. But I must say that people don\u2019t help situations like this when they become inflamed and people argue about figures they can hardly justify. \n\nOn the number of deaths \n\nWell, I can\u2019t account for all the bodies. But I think the escalation of the crisis in Southern Kaduna reached the highest point around Christmas. I am not talking about the recent Christmas and this is where all these numbers are coming from. You will recall that the president instructed the Inspector General of Police to go to the place and the IG asked his men on ground to give him the number of those that they could see were killed and they gave him 16 names. So, we have to be careful with numbers and if you ask me who do I believe, I would rather believe the IG than believe someone whose numbers are not structured and accounted for in full in the sense that we can see names and all of that. Of course no one is pleased about the losses. \n\nOf course no one is pleased but if we were to start counting from August when we heard the first attacks in Godogodo down to December, are you saying that the figures are exaggerated and the IG only came back with 16 names? \n\nThe thing is maybe we ask the police to update their own number, go back to the period you just mentioned and then give us their own number and let\u2019s see what it looks like. 808 is alarming and I hope it isn\u2019t up to that and I am persuaded in my mind that the number could be much lower. \n\nOr much higher? \n\nI doubt that. \n\nWhy do you doubt that? \n\nBecause we need to have a sincere explanation to where are they coming from; all of them and when we have a situation like this, who buries the corpse? It is usually the local authority and when they give numbers, we have no other person to believe. Dealing with Borno for instance you see conflicting numbers coming from the air force and the state. \n\nThe rising security situation nationwide and preparedness of security agencies to tackle it. \n\nTo be fair to our law enforcement, I am sorry that all these things are happening and you know the strategy the police has used for a while: when families whose members are kidnapped s say stay away, they stay away especially during the period of negotiation. The family is always given the priority but check the records; in more than 90 percent of kidnapping without payment of ransom and release of the victims, the police are able to catch the kidnappers. As we speak now, I know that the police has in custody not less than 800 suspected kidnappers. So, the system is working perhaps. It isn\u2019t like most people want it but are we able to apprehend them as they do these things? I think it is something that the police should be commended for doing. \n\nOn the air force accidental bombing in Rann, Borno State. \n\nIt is tragic as the president said and it is unfortunate and this shouldn\u2019t have happened and I hope the investigation will uncover why this has happened so that we ensure in the future that it doesn\u2019t happen. This is the first time we are having this kind of incident; it is tragic and unfortunate and we will live to regret it but such accident also happens in war situations. In Iraq, in Syria, in Afghanistan; there have always been civilian causalities, collateral damages and again they may not be up to the number we just had in Borno which again is shocking. But we wait for the panel of investigation to conclude but I don\u2019t think it is the norm in military history anywhere that compensations are paid to civilian causalities in war situations. I have my doubts. \n\nIf we feel sorry enough that these people were supposed to be receiving protection in their communities because it is an unofficial camp put together by the communities themselves and over 50 of them, I want to be very careful with figures, at the last time we heard, over 100 people lost their lives. As a matter of fact it is more than that as we speak. \n\nWhat numbers do you have? \n\nBy Saturday they were talking about 236 people. \n\nThat is a lot of people. \n\nYes, as I said it is very tragic and unfortunate but it didn\u2019t just happen because credible intelligence had been received. Boko Haram fighters had moved and had been picked by the system; satellite and all of that and they had gone to that community and when air raids were planned, the Boko Haram elements pulled out and you see that two days after that incident they came back again with the hope that they could hide and we deployed the military at the scene again. \n\nThe military said they are going to do an investigative hearing on this, do you think that it is going to be public? \n\nI don\u2019t know how they are going to do it but I know as many as 4 investigations are ongoing currently. \n\nWill the findings be made public? \n\nThe government is an accountable government. It has no reason to keep it away from the public. Would there be public hearings like the ones in the parliament? Well, I don\u2019t know that but I think that this is so painful. \n\nIf you are talking about precedence in that regard, at least we have the precedence in Israel where there are public hearings in the military and this is because the military is funded by tax payers\u2019 money. We are talking about an entire community, over 200 people which yourself have admitted, that is a lot of number which is something Nigerians should be concerned about and the military has to be open about. \n\nWe hope also that if there is blame, punishment should be dished out. Would there be compensation? We hope that when they come up with their recommendations, you are asking for precedent to be set if they are able to persuade the Nigerian government. \n\nIf there is none at all in the world, then the Federal Government can set precedence? \n\nWell, someone needs to make that suggestion first. \n\nWe don\u2019t even know if we have heard that over 200 people have been killed in any story before in all of the situations we have heard outside the country \n\nWhy has it been difficult for instance for the president to pay a visit to any of the places that are having these crisis?: Southern Kaduna, Borno. Yes, he has visited many of the fronts but the communities themselves, we haven\u2019t seen the president go there to pay sympathy visit. \n\nIt depends on what you want. If I come from any of these communities which have been given a battalion of the military or a squadron of mobile policemen around me and the president comes in and goes out, I am not saying that the president don\u2019t feel this, he is a father, he is a grandfather, he has family and he has his heart on all of this matter, what happens is that when he is represented by competent elements around him, they report to him about things that need to be done and I think that people should decide what they themselves want.

We had some energy at the start tonight but we didn\u2019t hold it, then we started turning the ball over. At halftime we got back to the plan \u2014 go inside out.\u201d \n   \nAnd that did the trick. \n   \nThe seventh-ranked Pirates erupted for 27 points in the third quarter, hitting 11 of 16 shots with four 3-pointers, and built a 16-point lead in the final period en route to a 60-51 victory. \n   \nWith leading scorers Collin Kelley and Alexzander Delgado limited to single digits, a pair of sophomores came forward to supply the offense. \n   \nIvory Kimble came off the bench to score 13 points on 6-for-6 shooting to go with his seven rebounds \u2014 both team highs \u2014 and Brock Williams hit two of his four 3-pointers in the big third quarter for a season-high 12 points. \n   \nIn the first meeting at West Valley three weeks ago, Davis dominated inside with its height advantage as 6-foot-5 Aaron Meza broke out for a career-best 22 points. But Meza was slowed some by a sore back on Saturday and he and interior teammate Michael Gordon picked up some early fouls, limiting what the Pirates wanted to do inside. \n   \nEnter Kimble. \n   \nKnown mostly for his rebounding, the 6-1 sophomore typically spells either of the senior bigs and he made the most of his chances Saturday. \n   \n\u201cI\u2019m mostly a rebounding guy. The coaches always tell me there\u2019s more to being productive than just points,\u201d Kimble said. \u201cBut tonight we needed some scoring and it was my time to step up. We had a lot more energy in the second half. We were just a lot better as a team.\u201d \n   \nAfter managing just eight field goals in the first half, the Pirates doubled that in the first 5:45 of the third quarter. They made six of their first seven shots with three treys and then added a 12-2 run later in the period. \n   \n\u201cWe went back to working inside out and we passed much better,\u201d Juarez said of the third-period burst. \u201cWe got the ball inside, we kicked it out, hit some shots and penetrated better. It was nice to see Ivory and Brock play well and that\u2019s what we tell them \u2014 contributions can come from anyone. Those kids really held their own tonight.\u201d \n   \nWest Valley also held its own, too, considering the Rams were without injured senior David Lindgren and his 16-point scoring average. \n   \nJustin Van De Brake scored a game-high 22 points, taking his career total to 996, Dallin Cluff had 13 points and five rebounds, and Spencer Bailey netted 10 points. \n   \nDavis (8-1, 14-3) owns a one-game lead over Moses Lake with three games left.

She came to practices and even provided an extra set of eyes from the bench for coach Joe Blodgett. \n   \nSaturday night, in the third-ranked Wolves biggest game of the season, the 5-foot-8 junior did what she does best. \n   \nPlaying for the first time since her injury last March, Hart made a bundle of big-time plays in addition to scoring 18 points, and Wapato surged past No. 4 Prosser 63-49 on the Wolfpack\u2019s floor to gain sole possession of the CWAC lead. \n   \n\u201cMake big plays? Tarryn always does,\u201d Blodgett said after his team overcame a seven-point second-half deficit and closed on a 13-0 run. \n   \nThe victory, on Wapato\u2019s senior night, improved the Wolves to 14-1 in league play and 14-2 overall. Prosser, which had won its previous seven games, slipped to 13-2 and 14-3. \n   \nJade Garza scored 15 points, Janealle Sutterlict had 13 and Chehalis Aleck 10 for Wapato, which trailed 36-31 at halftime and 42-35 with 4:52 left in the third quarter. \n   \nBut as per Blodgett\u2019s instructions, the Wolves ramped up their defensive pressure to limit Prosser to just one more point in the period and seven for the game. \n   \nThough Wapato was outrebounded 37-26 and outscored from the foul line 15-10, the Wolves forced 32 turnovers \u2014 19 of which came in the second half. \n   \n\u201cI told the girls at halftime,\u201d Blodgett said, \u201cthat we were being out-worked. Prosser was getting all the loose balls as well as beating us on the boards. Those are extra possessions, and when you give extra possessions to a team that talented, you make it tough on yourself.\u201d \n   \nYet as Wapato had done in the teams\u2019 previous meeting at Prosser, a post-intermission revival proved pivotal. \n   \n\u201cOur defense,\u201d Sutterlict said, \u201cis where we get our intensity.\u201d \n   \nThe Wolves outscored the Mustangs 40-23 during the second half of a 59-53 win in that game, and rolled 32-13 over the final two quarters of this one. \n   \nA Hart 3-pointer with 6:40 to play gave Wapato its first lead of the second half, and after the Mustangs went back in front 47-46, the Wolves embarked on their game-closing run. \n   \nHart scored five more points and brought the home fans to their feet with a behind-the-back pass to Sutterlict for a fast-break layup and a 57-49 cushion with a minute to play. \n   \n\u201cWe actually worked on that in shootaround today,\u201d Hart said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be playing again, but I did learn a lot from watching from the bench. It gave me a whole new perspective.\u201d \n   \nMarissa Cortes, a 5-4 sophomore point guard, scored 16 points to lead Prosser before leaving in the final seconds with an injury. \n   \nAli Cox, the Mustangs\u2019 lone senior, came off the bench for 10 points and 10 rebounds and 5-11 junior Brooke Wheeler totaled seven points and 11 boards for coach Kyler Bachofner. \n   \n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to put together a whole game,\u201d Blodgett said, \u201cand hopefully having Tarryn back will help us do that. We\u2019re getting her back at just the right time.\u201d \n   \nAnd that\u2019s not just for this season. \n   \nWapato, too, has only one senior. \n   \nPROSSER \u2014 Marissa Cortes 16, Groeneveld 2, Wheeler 7, Rodriguez 3, Olivarez 9, Stallcop 0, Ali Cox 10, Douglas 2.

But our goal was a league title and we got that. It was a big week for us.\u201d \n   \nThe ninth-ranked Grizzlies knocked off No. 6 Moses Lake 32-23 at home on Thursday, then dispatched Eisenhower 64-9 and Davis 43-18 in a pair of makeup duals from previous postponements. That sets the stage for the postseason, which begins next week with the district tournament in Wenatchee. \n   \n\u201cThursday was a great win for us, and finishing (6-0) really means something,\u201d said junior Moises Morales, who went 3-0 at 170 pounds in the three duals. \u201cWe put a lot of hard work into this. We had to keep our focus coming up here after Moses Lake and we did, that\u2019s part of our training.\u201d \n   \nWhile Davis finished 4-2 in league and is ranked 11th in the state, the Pirates\u2019 ability to compete with Sunnyside was severely compromised by giving away four forfeits and 24 points. The Grizzlies, too, held out three starters. \n   \nSunnyside\u2019s notable wins came from Morales, who bested Chris Huizar 4-2 in overtime at 170, and two-time state medalist Josiah Rodriguez, who earned a hard-fought 7-4 decision over John Sowers at 138. \n   \nDavis\u2019 big win \u2014 and the match of the day \u2014 came at 126 when sophomore Shawn Abeyta stunned state runner-up Elias Romero in overtime. Abeyta conceded a takedown in each of the first two periods and trailed 5-1 with less than 10 seconds left. But he launched into a takedown that led to two near-fall points as time expired, then did the same thing 30 seconds into the OT for a 10-5 victory. \n   \nThat may or may not be a preview of the district final as Abeyta said he is weighing a move down to 120 or staying at 126. \n   \nIn addition to Morales, Sam Guerrero (106), Fabian Ortega (113) and Rodriguez (138) all went 3-0 this week to help Sunnyside earn its first league title since 2013. \n   \nGuerrero, a sophomore, sparked Sunnyside\u2019s 17-0 start against Moses Lake and provided a 5-0 decision and pin in Saturday\u2019s matches. Ortega is a freshman with postseason upside who pinned his ML opponent and delivered a 10-1 major decision against Davis. \n   \n\u201cWe\u2019re excited for district because it feels like we\u2019re peaking,\u201d Morales said. \n   \nSunnyside beat Moses Lake for last year\u2019s district title at Davis. The seeding meeting will take place Friday in Wenatchee with first-round matches to follow and finals on Saturday. \n   \nRegional qualifiers from the CBBN will travel to Curtis for the Class 4A Region III tournament on Feb. 11. \n  \n CBBN  \n  \nSUNNYSIDE 43, DAVIS 18 \n   \nAt Eisenhower \n   \n160: Alex Huizar (D) d.

It was a scene that could have been brushed from an artist\u2019s palette; a picture perfection of a Scottish winter lochscape in all its beguiling serenity. \n \nOut walking in Perthshire with four friends, we had just stumbled upon Loch of Grandtully in the vast Griffin Forest near Aberfeldy. It was like finding a sparkling oasis and as we moved slightly up the trail to get a better view of the swans, a flock of teal sprung into the air and circled the lochan. These little ducks whistled as they wheeled and dipped, a soft piping that mirrored the gentleness of the water. \n \nWe had already passed by Loch Kennard and Loch Scoly, both of which were totally devoid of waterfowl, so to discover the swans and teal on this last lochan on our route was something of a surprise, especially since it was partially iced over. \n \nThe gap in the spruces overlooking the lochan was narrow and the whoopers slipped tantalisingly in and out of view. This family group consisted of two adults and two dowdier first-year birds. Whooper swans are so very special, displaying grace and grandeur yet with an innate shyness that makes them hard to approach, and as such, they generally prefer our less disturbed lochs. \n \nThese whoopers at Grandtully brought back fond memories of previous encounters, especially the excitement of watching an incoming family flight. In they swoop, long necks extended, the air thrumming from the rhythmic swish of powerful wings digging deep into the cold winter air. The elegant formation makes a final bank before descending onto the water\u2019s surface, which erupts into a trailing splatter of spume as the swans abruptly come to rest. It is unforgettable stuff. \n \nNot long after spotting the whoopers, we were in for another surprise. Ahead of us, a red deer stag strutted across the forest track. The antlers were well forked and he displayed a thick shaggy ruff on his neck and shoulders, a sure sign of a mature stag.  We tend to think of red deer as creatures of the open hill, but they are woodland animals at heart and will haunt such areas if given the opportunity. \n \nAt this time of year, stags and hinds form single sex herds, but this male was a solitary beast, probably because the thickly planted spruces within this forest make herding an impractical option. There will be precious little vegetation for deer to eat within the gloom of the plantation, but the abundant grasses, lichens and dwarf shrubs by the open forest edge will provide good grazing. \n \nFurther on, and a thin elongated sliver of black shiny poo caught my eye atop a small mossy knoll. It was the dropping of a pine marten and a warning marker to other martens that this territory is already taken. \n \nInfo \n \nWhooper swans are winter visitors, mostly from Iceland, although a few may also come from breeding populations in northern Norway and Russia. Loch Leven in Kinross-shire is a great place to see whoopers.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Keith Broomfield"},"topics":[],"title":"Whooper swans bring back fond memories","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Dundee","zipCode":"DD1","state":"Scotland","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Dundee City","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tayside and Fife Courier","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661741","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"22"},"name":"Tayside and Fife Courier","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thecourier.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201845855","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:29Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/01/iStock-519356190-150x150.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

I can easily come up with a hundred excuses to not go out and ride my bike: I\u2019m too tired; I don\u2019t have enough time; the weather\u2019s too bad. Then I get caught in a downward spiral where I can see my goals becoming more and more unattainable and before I know it half of the year has passed me by and I\u2019m looking to the following year to be THE year when I get my act together, get fitter and leaner. \n \nJanuary is a strange month. It\u2019s hyped up with the prospect of a new you, but in fact seems to be the proverbial nail in the coffin for many who are seeking to motivate themselves towards a healthier lifestyle. Those excuses I mentioned above, including many others, seem to be intensified by the cold, dark winter days in January and it often seems easier to sit down and switch the TV on rather than head out on your bike. \n \nThere are many ways to motivate yourself towards getting out on your bike. I find preparing my kit and having it sitting there waiting for me when I get up, or get home, always helps and means I\u2019m ready to roll whenever I want. \n Get out and ride no matter what the weather. \nKeeping a diary and logging your miles is also a great way to track your good work and progress, whether that is on electronic sites like Strava, or in a good old-fashioned paper training diary. \n \nAnother more controversial form of self-motivation is retail therapy. I say controversial because one of the joys of cycling is the ability to get out and enjoy the sport with the minimum of kit making it very accessible. \n \nBut if buying a shiny new bit for your bike, or indeed a shiny new bike, or even just some new bit of cycle clothing is going to encourage you to get out on your bike then surely it is worth it. I have never paid for a gym membership, preferring to enjoy nature\u2019s gym on my doorstep. So if sometimes buying some nice new kit renews my enthusiasm for participating in nature\u2019s gym when it less than welcoming outside my door then I see no problem with that. \n \nThere is, however, a balance to be sought and I have been found teetering on the brink. On occasions my well-intentioned enthusiasm for buying new kit has become more enjoyable than actually using said kit. If you find yourself sitting on the couch with a cup of tea in hand flicking through the pages of a cycling magazine, looking at all the cool bikes and great places to ride as the mega-expensive waterproof jacket you bought last month still hangs in the wardrobe with the price tag, on then you know you it has tipped too far the wrong way. \n \nPerhaps the only way to balance that equilibrium again is go and buy some more kit to gain extra motivation. \n \nJoin the Blazing Saddles Strava Club at: www.strava.com/clubs/BlazingSaddlesWeekendCourier \n \nWhere to Ride?    Kintyre Ultra Cycle Race \u2013 Off road cycle event \n \nWhat is it?             Off-road cycle event \n \nDistance:                73 miles \n \nWhen?   Saturday 6th May 2017 \n \nEnter at:                www.entrycentral.com/KintyreWayUltra \n \nInfo \n \nThe Kintyre Ultra Cycle Race is a new amateur event for 2017 that runs coast to coast on the Kintyre Peninsula.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Caroline Lindsay"},"topics":[],"title":"Don\u2019t let winter stop you from getting out the bike","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Dundee","zipCode":"DD1","state":"Scotland","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Dundee City","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tayside and Fife Courier","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661741","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"22"},"name":"Tayside and Fife Courier","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thecourier.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201846422","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:35Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/01/It-might-be-cold-outside-but-once-you-are-riding-you-soon-warm-up-150x150.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Gen. Xavier Becerra in his new job, it was an unheralded duty that Republican legislators wanted to pin him down on during recent confirmation hearings in Sacramento: the vetting of ballot initiatives. \n\nThe attorney general is tasked under California law to write a brief title and summary of each measure that will end up on the state ballot. \n \n\u201cWhat will you do to ensure that you\u2019re being descriptive and objective, and following the election code, when you write those ballot titles and summaries?\u201d asked Assemblyman Jordan Cunningham (R-Templeton). \n \nTo understand the question requires knowing a bit of California political history. Attorneys general have long had the duty to collect and then prepare proposed initiatives before the measure\u2019s backers can begin collecting voter signatures. \n \nBut in the era of big money initiative campaigns \u2014 generally viewed as the years following the landmark 1978 property tax rollback, Proposition 13 \u2014 critics have occasionally complained of partisan scheming, alleging that the title and summary of an initiative are sometimes crafted in a way that pleases the attorney general\u2019s political allies. \n\nPolitical Road Map: Californians have a love-hate relationship with initiatives » \n\nOpponents of Proposition 13 complained that former Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger, a Republican, wrote a summary that didn\u2019t reveal the law made it harder to pass tax increases in the Legislature. Gov. Jerry Brown, in his time as attorney general, took fire over the ballot summary for the 2008 ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8 , and its emphasis on how the (now defunct) law would \u201celiminate\u201d the right of same-sex couples to marry . \n\nAdvocates of overhauling California\u2019s public employee pension system have balked more than once over initiative titles and summaries written by Democrats serving as attorney general. In 2005, a proposed reform was summarized as removing death and disability benefits. The most recent attorney general, now Sen. Kamala Harris, also came under fire for her summaries of efforts to change pension benefits for government workers . \n\nThe evidence is largely circumstantial. And judges have generally given pretty wide latitude to the attorney general, who\u2019s simply instructed in state election law to summarize \u201cthe chief purpose and points\u201d of an initiative. \n\nBut it\u2019s also a potential game changer. Strategists and pollsters often believe an initiative\u2019s title and summary is a prescient predictor of the campaign ahead. And some California voters make snap decisions on ballot measures based on those easily accessible nuggets of information. \n\nGiven that Democrats have held the office of attorney general for 18 years, it\u2019s hardly surprising that the loudest calls for change come from Republicans. But those efforts have been routinely rebuffed. \n\nIn 2015, legislation to impose new rules on the attorney general was quietly killed in the Assembly\u2019s appropriations committee. Earlier this month, newly elected Assemblyman Kevin Kiley (R-El Dorado Hills) decided to go one step further. His proposal would change the state\u2019s constitution and transfer the responsibility for initiative titles and summaries to the independent Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office, which currently writes a fiscal analysis of each measure. \n\nAs for Becerra, the Los Angeles Democrat told lawmakers in confirmation hearings this month that he believes in fairness when it comes to summarizing initiatives. \n\n\u201cI know many of you will be reading over my shoulders,\u201d he told assemblymembers on Jan. 10. \u201cAnd I understand the importance of a word.\u201d \n   \njohn.myers@latimes.com \n\nFollow  @johnmyers  on Twitter, sign up for our daily  Essential Politics newsletter  and listen to the weekly  California Politics Podcast \n\nALSO: \n\nCalifornia initiative campaigns rake in a record $473 million in 2016 \n\nPolitical Road Map: How unlimited cash gets funneled into legislative campaigns \n\nUpdates on California politics","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"John Myers"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Political Road Map: Some believe there's bias baked into the official descriptions of California initiatives","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Orange","zipCode":"92626","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Costa Mesa","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Coastline Pilot","feed":{"genre":"Obituaries","tags":[],"id":"169753712","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Coastline Pilot","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.coastlinepilot.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-xavier-becerra-california-attorney-general-snap-20170124-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-road-map-propositions-20161113-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/topic/social-issues/family/same-sex-marriage/proposition-8-%28california-2010%29-EVHST0000250-topic.html","http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/29/local/me-gaymarriage29","http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/07/news/la-ol-fighting-words-public-employee-pension-reform-20140107","http://www.twitter.com/johnmyers","http://www.latimes.com/newsletters/la-newsletter-essential-politics-signup-page-htmlstory.html","https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/california-politics-podcast/id1067429614?mt=2","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-november-proposition-money-20161107-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-roadmap-unlimited-money-legislature-elections-20161023-snap-story.html","http://www.latimes.com/essentialpolitics"],"sequenceId":"695201848903","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d2768/turbine/la-pol-ca-road-map-initiatives-title-summary-power-20170129/600"}],"video":[]}}

It also prompted concern from Australian MPs from both sides, especially over how the order might affect Australian dual nationals. \n \nMr Turnbull's office declined to comment on the 25-minute phone call with Mr Trump. Fairfax Media has been told the President confirmed his administration would honour last year's agreement, though it remains unclear how many of the roughly 2000 asylum-seekers held on Nauru and Manus Island will be resettled in the US. \n SHARE  Share on Facebook  SHARE  Share on Twitter  TWEET  Pin to Pinterest  PIN  Link   Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Australia Day.  Photo: Rohan Thomson  \nUnder the Obama deal, final details, including the number to be resettled, were not expected to be nailed down until the second half of this year, after US officials scrutinised applications and carried out security checks. \n \nBut news that Mr Trump won't overturn his predecessor's arrangement with Australia means the plight of many refugees who have languished on the Pacific islands for years may finally end. \n \n   \nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten welcomed the news, saying: \"I'm pleased if the Americans honour their side of the bargain.\" \n \nMr Trump's executive order includes a four-month pause on all refugee arrivals, a three-month ban on entry by citizens from seven countries of terrorism concern \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Sudan and Somalia \u2013 and an indefinite halt on all refugees from Syria. \n \nIt also prioritises refugees who are fleeing persecution as members of religious minorities in their home countries, most obviously Christians and other non-Muslims in the Middle East and South Asia. \n \nTravellers with US visas and even residency permits were reportedly detained at American airports or prevented from boarding US-bound planes, but Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said her department had received no requests for help from \"Australians unable to board transport to the United States\". \n \n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals,\" she said. \n \nWhen asked about US legal residents who were visiting Australia and might have difficulty returning, a spokeswoman for Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said: \"Anyone who is concerned their visa may expire before their return to the US should make contact with the department. The department will assess any applications for further stay based on the merits of the case and in line with the relevant visa criteria.\" \n \nNeither Ms Bishop nor Mr Turnbull echoed the views of British Prime Minister Theresa May, who said through her spokesman that \"we do not agree with\" the approach taken by Mr Trump on immigration. \n \nBut Australian MPs expressed concern, including Trade Minister Steven Ciobo, who told Sky News: \"That's not the position that I support \u2026 it's not a position that most Australians would support.\" \n \nLabor MP Anne Aly, the first Muslim woman in the Australian Parliament and a counter-terrorism expert, said the countries targeted by Mr Trump were not the major exporters of foreign fighters and therefore it made little sense as a security measure. \n \nShe said it wasn't a Muslim ban because it would affect many minorities from those countries. Rather it was a \"bullshit, conman, snake oil salesman way of trying to make good on his promise of banning Muslims\". \n \nLiberal MP and former human rights commissioner Tim Wilson said that \"so long as people pass security, health and identity assessments, people should be accepted based on the legitimacy of their claim to be a refugee\". \n \nLiberal MPs Jason Falinski and Trent Zimmerman said Mr Trump's approach was not one that Australia should follow. \n \nLabor frontbencher Andrew Giles said he was \"so concerned \u2026 about the utterances of President Trump because they do seem to be a threat to a rules-based international order\".","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"David Wroe"},"topics":[{"name":"Top Asia-Pacific stories","group":"Top stories"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"South Pacific Islands news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"}],"title":"Donald Trump tells Malcolm Turnbull he will honour deal to resettle refugees from Nauru and Manus","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Sydney Morning Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587970","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Sydney Morning Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.smh.com.au/","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201849197","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:26Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Polk and Andrew Johnson. \n \nThe current library and archives building in Nashville, which was constructed in 1952, no longer has the space to store all the valuable records that it is responsible for.

It is also the final resting place for the records of governors when they leave office. \n \n  That\u2019s why library and archive officials are asking Gov.

Those records go all the way back to the birth of this state in 1796. In fact, some documents go back even farther to the failed state of Franklin right here in Northeast Tennessee. \n \nBecause the current building has no more space, some of these valuable records will have to be stored in private warehouses, which could create barriers to the public\u2019s access to these records, as well as security and liability concerns. \n \nThe proposed state-of-the-art building has been in the works for nearly a decade.

The integrated development environment (IDE) had been in preview for quite some time under the name Visual Studio \"15\" , and offers various improvements and enhancements over previous versions, included an increased focus on mobile cross-platform development. \n \nThe company has now released another update for the IDE , integrating new features and fixing a number of issues. \n  \nMicrosoft has released a summary of the change log relevant to the latest update to Visual Studio 2017 Release Candidate. It includes: \n  The .NET Core and ASP.NET Core workload is no longer in preview. We have fixed several bugs and improved usability of .NET Core and ASP.NET Core Tooling.  Team Explorer connect experience is now improved to make it easier to find the projects and repos to which you want to connect.  The Advanced Save option is back due to popular demand.  Multiple installation-related issues are now fixed in this update, including hangs. We\u2019ve also added a retry button when installation fails, disambiguated Visual Studio installs in the Start menu, and added support for creating a layout for offline install.   \nMoreover, the company has also removed Data Science and Python Development workloads. Microsoft explains that as the IDE approaches public release, many components including the ones mentioned above, won't be able to meet some necessary requirements - such as translation to non-English languages. As a result, they'll be available as separate downloads later. \n \nMicrosoft has encouraged users of the release candidate to report bugs , track feedback on developer forums , and voice suggestions on UserVoice .

We can be our own little island.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s a stance that will be tested as California doubles down on its climate policies even as Trump steps back from the battle against global warming. And despite the bravado displayed last week at a conference on climate change hosted by state government officials, there was pervasive anxiety about the future as well.  \n \n\"I'm worried,\" said a federal scientist at the exhibit who asked to withhold his name  because he feared retaliation. Fearful that the Trump administration would strip climate information from government websites, he said he asked his team to start downloading information so they could continue their work.    \n\nCalifornia has always charted its own course on cleaning up the air, clamping down on tailpipe emissions decades ago to fight smog in Los Angeles before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was even created in 1970. But the gap between Sacramento and Washington was growing into a chasm only a week after Trump took the oath of office.  \n \nThe president is greenlighting oil pipelines that were rejected by President Obama. He told car manufacturers that regulations are \u201cout of control,\u201d and Oklahoma Atty. Gen. Scott Pruitt, his nominee to lead the EPA, expressed doubts about the severity of climate change during his confirmation hearing. \n\nMeanwhile, California is moving to dramatically slash its greenhouse gas emissions, and Senate leader Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) recently floated the possibility of generating all of the state\u2019s electricity from renewable sources such as solar and wind. Major utilities have proposed a $1-billion investment  in electrifying the transportation network, including more charging stations for cars. \n\nIt\u2019s created a sense of dissonance for Californians, who are hunkering down even as they keep a wary eye on what\u2019s happening on the opposite side of the country. \n\n\u201cYou turn on the TV at night, and you hear these terrible things that are happening,\u201d said Kip Lipper, who works on environmental legislation for the state Senate. \u201cI tell my daughter, it\u2019s good to be cognizant of that, but this is the best place to be, in California.\u201d \n \nCalifornia emits only 1% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases, but the state has tried to transform itself into an international model for fighting global warming. While Trump talks about withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, officials here continue seeking new partners for the state\u2019s own, more ambitious international agreement . \n\nGov. Jerry Brown , in his State of the State speech Tuesday, said California wouldn\u2019t step back from its agenda no matter what happens in Washington, a message repeatedly emphasized by top state leaders at the climate conference. \n\n\u201cThis is when you do your best work,\u201d said John Laird, secretary of the Natural Resources Agency. \u201cWe can\u2019t worry about pulling back just to sink with everyone else who isn\u2019t moving at all.\u201d \n\nThe conference was planned before Trump won the presidency, but the results of the election created a charged atmosphere among the hundreds of scientists, government officials and advocates who showed up. Attendees talked about being  \u201cresolute in our values,\u201d or how there\u2019s a \u201cmajor threat before us,\u201d or how strong policies are needed \u201cnow more than ever.\u201d \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a greater seriousness in the room,\u201d said Jonathan Parfrey, executive director of Climate Resolve, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit that helped organize the two-day event. \n\nCalifornia\u2019s climate agenda remains controversial, and some business interests believe the state is putting itself at a competitive disadvantage by ramping up regulations. The state\u2019s premiere initiative \u2014 the cap-and-trade program, which requires companies to purchase permits to release greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere \u2014 is the target of an ongoing legal challenge . \n\nBut the week\u2019s events were also a reminder of how much further the state has moved past the national conversation about climate change. Debates revolve around how global warming should be addressed, not whether it should be, or whether it\u2019s even real at all.  \n \nThree consecutive state administrations have pushed the state\u2019s policies forward. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, approved the country\u2019s first rules for regulating greenhouse gases from vehicle tailpipes. Gov.

Qantas is offering refunds to any passengers travelling from Australia to the United States who are affected by a new entry ban. Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days.

When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US.

California's Secretary of State Alex Padilla gave the green light on Thursday for proponents of \"California Nationhood\" -- also known as Calexit -- to start collecting the nearly 600,000 signatures needed for the measure to qualify on the November 2018 ballot. The 585,407 signatures required by July 25 represent eight percent of registered voters in California -- the most populous state in the country with nearly 40 million residents and the world's sixth-largest economy. \n \nShould the initiative make it on the ballot, a \"Yes\" vote would repeal clauses in the California Constitution \"stating California is an inseparable part of the United States and that the United States Constitution is the supreme law of the land,\" a statement by Padilla's office said. Voters would then need to decide in another referendum in 2019 whether California should become a separate country. Padilla said the independence measure -- deemed highly unrealistic -- would have a deep impact on the state and would likely face legal challenges. \"Assuming that California actually became an independent nation, the state and its local governments would experience major, but unknown, budgetary impacts,\" he warned. \"This measure also would result in tens of millions of dollars of one-time state and local election costs.\" \n \nCalexit enthusiasts, whose campaign is called Yes California, are pushing for independence on grounds the state is out of step with the rest of the US and could flourish on its own. \"In our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children,\" according to their website. The idea of independence became very appealing to many Californians following Trump's shock election. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton easily beat Trump in the progressive state, winning by more than 4.2 million votes, almost double the number of ballots cast for Trump. \n  \nEdited by The Shadow, Today, 03:","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"SHOWDOWN: California Threat to Cut Funds to Feds: Secession Campaign Gains Momentum","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Baltimore","zipCode":"21228","state":"Maryland","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Catonsville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Catonsville Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169712049","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Catonsville Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://baltimoresun.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/01/27/california-could-cut-off-feds-in-response-to-trump-threats/","https://www.yahoo.com/news/california-campaign-secede-gains-momentum-030236966.html"],"sequenceId":"695201872832","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:29Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n\nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n\n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n\n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n\nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n\n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n\n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\" \n\n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"SG","country":"Singapore"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Yahoo!

That is a ­Constitutional violation. See u in court.\" \n\nStephanie Grisham, a White House spokeswoman, said: \"The high-risk territories are based on Congressional statute and ­nothing else.\" \n\nTrump has handed over management of his real estate, licensing and merchandising business to his sons to avoid the perception that he is making presidential decisions to boost his own business. \n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Trump has retained ownership of the ­company, meaning if it thrives during his presidency, he will profit. \n\nThe President's order makes no mention of Turkey, which has faced several terrorist attacks in recent months. \n\nThe State Department on Wednesday updated a travel warning for Americans visiting Turkey, noting that \"an increase in anti-American rhetoric has the potential to inspire independent actors to carry out acts of violence against US citizens\". \n\nTrump has licensed his name to two luxury towers in Istanbul. A Turkish company also manufactures a line of Trump-branded home furnishings. \n\n\"I have a little conflict of ­interest 'cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul',\" he had said in December 2015. \n\nAlso untouched by Friday's ­executive order is the UAE, a powerful Muslim ally with whom the US ­has complicated ­relations. \n\nTrump has licensed his name to a Dubai golf resort as well as a luxury home ­development and spa. \n\nIts ­developer, Hussain Sajwani, attended a New Year's eve party at Trump's Florida estate Mar-a-Lago, where a video showed the then President-elect singling him out for praise, calling him and his family \"the most beautiful people\". \n\n--IANS \n\npy/vt","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Turkey news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Trump ban excludes Muslim countries where he does business","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"SG","country":"Singapore"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Yahoo!

Qantas is offering refunds to any passengers travelling from Australia to the United States who are affected by a new entry ban. Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days. That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.\n\nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.\n\nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government.\n\nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.\n\n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\"\n\nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.\n\n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said.\n\n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\"\n\nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

On Thursday's Morning Drive on the Golf Channel, live at the Orange County Convention Center, the STAR EV Sirius took center stage along with big industry names like Club Car, E-Z-Go, and Garia. \n \nAlthough primarily associated with golf, the golf car industry now encompasses a wide range of small vehicles from LSVs (a street legal low-speed vehicle) to utility vehicles to the classic golf course companion. STAR EV kept the golf course-to-neighborhood overlap in mind with the ground-up creation of the new Sirius model, which boasts automotive conveniences like an electronic locking trunk, USB port, LED illuminated dashboard, and self-cancelling turn signals. But it is still golf course worthy, with optional golf ball holder inserts, and a large bagwell, or the option of a 2-in-1 Combo Seat (a patented design that turns a rear seat into a golf bag holder without tools). \n \nSTAR EV revealed two prototypes at its PGA show exhibit; a standard Sirius with 2-in-1 Combo Seat, and a \"tricked-out\" version to show how customizable the Sirius will be. The front trunk gives the golf car the look of a hood that can be painted a different color from the main body, like the sleek matte black trunk on the deep metallic maroon prototype. STAR EV also offers a variety of wheels, with rim finishes in machined aluminum, matte black, dura chrome, black PVD, and special color accents. \n \nWhile the models at the show were standard 2 and 4-passenger vehicles, the Sirius line will expand to include 6 and 8 passenger models like the STAR EV Classic. As all STAR's vehicles, the Sirius is 100% electric with a 4 kW AC motor, 350 A Curtis AC controller, and can travel at a top speed of 19.5 mph. (The LSV version peaks at 25 mph.) The line officially launches in the summer of 2017, available through any of STAR's 250+ authorized dealers nationwide and internationally. \n \nRead the full story at http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb14021772.htm \n PRWeb.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Retail industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Radio industry news","group":"Media"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: golf news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"New Sirius model from STAR Electric Vehicles makes its debut at PGA Merchandise Show","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Clay","zipCode":"39773","state":"Mississippi","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"West Point","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Times Leader","feed":{"genre":"Press Release","tags":[],"id":"186403425","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Daily Times Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailytimesleader.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.starev.com/","http://www.starev.com/dealer-locator/","http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb14021772.htm"],"sequenceId":"695201895185","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T11:06:14Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It's ready and waiting to go.\" \n \nThe state's maximum temperature is expected in Wilcannia, with a blistering top of 46 degrees.  \n \nIf this January has seemed hotter and drier than usual, that's because it has been - especially at night.  \n \nMaximum daytime temperatures in Sydney last January averaged 27.4 degrees. This January has so far averaged 29.1 degrees, which should rise with two more hot days to end the month.  \n \nMeanwhile, Sydney has smashed the previous record for hot nights in January, with four nights (so far) staying above 24 degrees. The previous record was two.  \n \nSydney is on track to break the record for the number of summer days above 35 degrees, with just two more needed to break the all-time record \n \nMr Taggart said this January has been \"almost certainly one of the hottest on record\". \n \nAnd the heat won't end this week. Next weekend is forecast to again hit 40 degrees, Mr Taggart said, as the Bureau forecasts a \"hotter than average\" February with hot conditions pushing into March.  \n \nJanuary is also likely to end with less than half the month's average rainfall. So far the city has had 48.8mm, much lower than the average of 102.5mm. \n \nIt's also significantly less than last year when Sydney received 249.8mm during January. \n \nElsewhere in the state, Moree is in the middle of a remarkable hot streak, with the town sweltering through 34 consecutive days above 35 degrees. Mr Taggart expects that to stretch to 41 days based on current forecasts, close to the state record.  \n \n\"The forecast for the next seven days is pretty horrific,\" Mr Taggart said. \"That heat is completely unrelenting.\" \n \n\"The forecast seems bad for Richmond and Sydney, but it's nothing compared to Moree.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Weather news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"}],"title":"Students to sweat through heatwave in first days back at school","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Sydney Morning Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587970","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Sydney Morning Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Environment","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.smh.com.au/","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201897856","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They play Adelaide twice and the three teams immediately above them once. \n \nIn the weekend's only other game, Dandenong (14-6) defeated Melbourne 78-66 to initially keep top spot, a position they held until Sunday's loss.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sydney news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Narrow wins, but big WNBL prize for Sydney","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"GWN7 - Yahoo7","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"594371828","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"GWN7 - Yahoo7","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"https://au.gwn7.yahoo.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201903419","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Without funds for an attorney, I accepted deferred probation. It has followed me my entire life. \n \nI graduated from college, law, and graduate school, yet I had to endure a hearing to ascertain my fitness to practice. It also caused employment rejection. \n \nLater, as assistant county attorney in El Paso, and elected district attorney in Willacy County, I routinely dismissed pot cases. Prosecutor\u2019s offices have limited budgets, yet mountains of cases. Dismissing marijuana offenses, allowed me to send more dangerous criminals to prison. \n \nEven probation for pot was wasteful. Curfews and reporting requirements should be for prowlers and burglars, not pot smokers. \n \nThis problem persists, as 620,000 Americans were arrested for pot last year. Yes, illegal marijuana creates jobs for probation officers, prosecutors, bailiffs, chemists, clerical staff and many more; however taxpayers get soaked. \n \nCalifornia and three other states legalized marijuana on Nov. 8. Voters were persuaded by the Colorado experience, where $2.4 billion in revenues and 17,000 jobs were created in legalization\u2019s first year. Some of this boom comes from visiting Texans. \n \nThe Denver Post polled, \u201cWould you repeal legalization?\u201d The answer; \u201cNo\u201d, by a 51 percent to 36 percent margin. Gallup\u2019s 2016 poll showed support for legalization has grown to 60 percent nationally, and recent studies demonstrate no increased use among youngsters since legalization. Colorado is booming, and other states want what they\u2019re smoking. \n \nThe old \u201cReefer Madness\u201d arguments against marijuana have been dispelled. Today\u2019s legalization opponents such as Insys Therapeutics, which develops synthetic painkillers, poured $500,000 into the \u201cNo\u201d vote in Arizona. It\u2019s these legal painkillers which cause so much addiction and harm. \n \nPrescription drugs increase our health costs and Big Pharma doesn\u2019t want competition. The Catholic Church was also a huge contributor, with the Boston Archdiocese donating $850,000 to oppose Massachusetts\u2019 marijuana initiative. \n \nOne lingering anti-pot argument is that people will ingest and drive. This happens anyway and it will be illegal everywhere. \n \nNot satisfied, opponents wonder how they will test for marijuana. Field tests still work, but how about we just arm each officer with a chocolate bar, and they could cuff the stoned drivers as they grab for it. \n \nLegalization will come eventually, as it\u2019s only the oldest age groups who are opposed. \n \nAn estimated 15 million Americans use marijuana regularly, and about half our population has admitted trying marijuana. \n \nMarijuana decriminalization bills for the 2017 Texas Legislature, have been filed, including one by El Paso\u2019s own Joe Moody. \n \nRepublicans are increasingly in favor, because of the fiscal benefits and individual freedom arguments. Democrats are already there, and almost everyone wants to decrease the power of the violent drug cartels who smuggle pot across our border. \n \nLet\u2019s legalize it, and have Mexico put up the wall to keep Texans from trafficking marijuana into their country. \n \nEl Paso attorney Steve Fischer has been a professor of criminology and a Texas State Bar director.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 45 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bernalillo","zipCode":"87125","state":"New Mexico","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Albuquerque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KOAT","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659419","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"169"},"name":"KOAT","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.koat.com"},"dataFormat":"video","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201908186","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But, far from turning off investment in alternative energy, a fundamental change in electricity generation has occurred to the point that a full reversal of this trend is unlikely. Latin America is leading the way in renewable energy; indeed, one of the biggest proponents is on America\u2019s doorstep \u2013 in Mexico \n \nThe economic/geopolitical/ uncertainty caused by the election of Donald Trump to the presidency of the United States will also extend to global energy markets. \n \nGiven his personal skepticism over climate change, and his vow to pull the United States out of the 2016 Paris climate accord, many investors, world leaders and governments are anxious about the immediate future for renewable energies and for projects to mitigate climate change. \n \nHowever, declining prices, rapid technological advances and a growing commitment to reducing carbon emissions by governments at federal, state and municipal levels across the world has brought about a re-evaluation of energy investment priorities. There has been such a fundamental change in electricity generation over the past decade that a full reversal seems improbable. In the United States , this has meant a steady stream of new investments in renewables, alongside the shift away from coal as a fuel for generation. \n \nThis is a trend replicated across the globe: from Europe to Africa and Asia , renewables are on the rise. However, it is Latin America where renewables look set not only to hold their own, but dramatically expand their hold on the future of energy production. \n \nMuch was made of the fact that, in 2016, Costa Rica was able to power its entire electricity grid from renewable sources for more than two months. Impressive as this is, Costa Rica\u2019s is a small economy, with a small population that is blessed with impressive hydroelectric power resources. \n \nBut we are also seeing a fundamental shift toward non-hydro renewable investment in many of the bigger economies in the region as well. \n \nLast year\u2019s Ernst and Young Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index (RECAI) saw the United States retain the top spot, along with three Latin American countries rounding out the top 10. Chile , fourth on the global list, expects to be able to source 70 percent of its power from renewable source by 2050, with massive solar projects dominating the more than 4.7 gigawatts in renewable power projects already in the planning phase. \n \nDespite its many political and economic problems, Brazil has risen to sixth in the rankings, thanks to continuing investments in wind and solar. After severe drought hit the country\u2019s hydroelectric power generation, Brazil has added nine GW in wind capacity since 2001, and more than 2.5 GW in solar capacity since 2014. \n \nArgentina\u2019s recent political change and its program of structural and regulatory reform make it a focus for international renewable energy investors, and it has entered the top 20 for the first time. Its new trust fund for renewable energy projects and the establishment of clear rules for renewable energy auctions have helped to heighten the international excitement about Argentina . \n \nBut the brightest start of the bunch lies just south of the United States : Mexico . \n \nMexico\u2019s star has risen rapidly in recent years, in large part thanks to the two successful renewable energy generation auctions that took place in March and September 2016 . These auctions brought in billions of dollars in investment and produced record low prices for power generation. At last year\u2019s Mexico International Renewable Energy Conference , an investor explained to me that Mexico is \u201cthe place in the world to invest in renewables,\u201d largely a result of the success of that country\u2019s landmark 2013 energy reform. \n \nAnd, despite the fact that imports of natural gas from the United States are booming because of new cross-border pipelines and rising demand, Mexico has ample room to grow its renewables sector. That same rising electricity demand means there is the potential for many different fuel sources to power the country, and the regulatory and legal framework is highly conducive to foreign investors. Most importantly, Mexico\u2019s world class solar and wind resources are nicely complemented by low natural gas prices and supplemented by new investments in hydroelectric and geothermal generation. \n \nThis is not to say that the path ahead for renewable energy development in Latin America is without challenges. \n \nThe social license problem, in which energy projects must receive the consent of local communities before they begin construction, is a thorny one for all major infrastructure and energy projects, and consulting firms that specialize in the issue stand to make a fortune in exchange for their services in the years ahead. Renewable energy projects face stiff competition for investment dollars from other development projects. Significant investments will also need to take place to modernize power grids. Lastly, we should not underestimate the impact of falling fossil fuel prices and the change of attitude toward climate change at the highest levels of government in the United States . \n \nBut the pivot to renewables is a sea change in energy policy that appears to be developing into a growing wave in Latin America . As the region\u2019s largest economies begin to realize the potential of their natural endowments, and as they learn from each other\u2019s successful experiments with regulatory and legislative change, the pace of the change will quicken. What we have seen in the Americas to date is simply the beginning of a new era for power production in the New World. \n \n Duncan Wood is the director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington DC .

The 2017 Miss Barton County and Miss Golden Belt Scholarship Pageant was held at the Great Bend High School auditorium, and features four contestants for Miss Barton county, and five for Miss Golden Belt. \nAfter a hiatus of several year\u2019s, the pageant was revived in 2013 by Kristy Straub and Tina Mingenback. Since then, it has sent eight crown-wearers to the Miss Kansas pageant. \nKristy Straub and Candice Lawellin, co-directors of the pageant, were on hand Saturday morning as the participants participated in the interview part of the contest, and later rehearsed group numbers and each phase of the contest. Participants must be between the ages of 17 and 24, and must at least be a senior in high school, Straub said. \nMiss Barton County is open only to women who reside in Barton County. Those participants were Viktoria Donetz of Hoisington, Sydney Boxberger of Hoisington, Maddy Hayden of Great Bend and Makayla Lofland of Great Bend. Each are students at their respective high schools. \nThe Miss Golden Belt title is open to women from all over the state. Participants were Jerika Mitchell of Ellsworth, a student at Fort hays State University;Shae Amerin of Johnson, a student at Stanton County High School, Christina Million of Dodge City, a student at Dodge City Community College; Callie Lane of De Soto, a student at the University of Missouri at Kansas City and Emily Rugg of Hazelton, a student at South Barber high School. \nThe six-person panel of judges included many familiar faces from among Great Bend\u2019s community-minded supporters. They were Megan Hammeke, Rita Krause, Bev Schmeidler, Charlie Suchy, Cody Schmidt and Jewel Davis. Announcers were Scott Donovan and Mark Mingenback. Emily Goad and Shelli Schmidt acted as auditors for the event. \nA favorite feature of the pageant is the contributions from the 2017 Sunflower Princesses. They included Baze Hogan, Alexandria Omenski, Abygail Arnold, Trinity Eldridge, and Hayden Lindon, all of Great Bend, as well as Jade Holman of Otis and Madison Henning of Claflin. \nOther Golden Belt royalty featured at the event included 2016 Miss Barton County Hannah Mauler of Great Bend and 2016 Miss Golden Belt Sara Gustin of Hays. Each have worked hard over the past year to promote their platform causes. For Mauler, a student at Kansas State University, majoring in both Kinesiology Gerontology, that platform is \u201cHow Fit is your life?\u201d She has worked to encourage others to strive for the healthiest lifestyle possible. \nGustin, a freshman at Kansas State University, has changed her major from Musical Theater to that of Agricultural Economics Pre-Law, her platform issue is \u201cBeing in the know.\u201d \nThe women participated in four events; an interview, a swimsuit competition, an evening wear competition, and a talent exhibition. The qualities judges looked for in the winners included pleasant personality and speaking ability, fitness, poise and confidence, and personality. Each part was weighted differently, Straub said. \nBoth winners will receive a $1,000 scholarship, and will go on to compete in the Miss Kansas competition at Pratt in June. Winners were not decided before press time, but will be featured in the Tuesday edition of the Great Bend Tribune.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"2017 Miss Barton County and Miss Golden Be...","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Barton","zipCode":"67530","state":"Kansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Great Bend","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Great Bend Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"173194957","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"51"},"name":"Great Bend Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gbtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201918081","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

the treatment, the teeth removal and the mucus all combine to make it hard at the moment.  I had RT and chemo in 2013 for tonsil cancer, and your description brings back lots of memories of how it was afterwards. \n \n\nI can't answer all the questions, but I will do what I can.  Starting from the bottom, the average woman needs 2000 kCal each day to maintain body weight, assuming good health and normal mobility.  If you are healing (as you are at this stage, and will be for a while) then your body needs more in the way of protein, in particular.  If you are less mobile (as you probably are at the moment), then your normal requirements will be reduced.  It's a balance, but what it does mean is that this one bag of feed is giving you the majority of what you need already, and you only have to top up a bit during the day to maintain your weight.  You certainly won't starve. \n \n\nI found that certain foods made the mucus much worse, and some just made me feel sick at the thought of them, so I can sympathise with your predicament.  Anything with dairy in (and that includes the fortisips) may well increase your mucus production.  It is renowned for doing that anyway, and when your body is out of kilter then you need to be aware of such things.  \n \nI found that the easiest foods to eat were either blended very finely, like you would with a Nutribullet), or oily.  The radiotherapy destroys both the saliva glands and the membrane down your throat that provides the lubrication when you swallow food, so anything that is either wet or slightly greasy (in the nicest possible way - I'm not talking about a full english breakfast here) will slide down much better. \n \nIf you have soups, I found that adding either silken tofu or pea protein powder was really helpful, as without them I was starving again very quickly.  Both vanish into the soup, especially when it is blended, and both give your body an extra supply of the much-needed protein. \n \nBananas and avocados blend particularly well together, and for over a year after finishing my treatment I would have a smoothie every day for one of my meals.  I would use 2 bananas (100 calories each), half an avocado (another 100 calories), a big spoon of natural yogurt (100 calories), a very generous spoon of nutella or peanut butter (2-300 calories) and water to make it the right consistency.  Perversely perhaps, water is the most difficult thing for me to swallow on its own as it washes away what little lubrication I have in my throat.  Thicker liquids are much easier. \n \nOnce you are back swallowing food successfully then you can try other things, but for now baby steps would be best.  Food is fuel, so whether you want it or not you need to keep trying it.  It took about 6 months for my taste to return to something akin to normal, so for the time being the best thing you can do is make some up, and have it in little portions. \n \nAs for the mucus, sorry to be graphic but the only way I could find of dealing with it was to sort of pull it forwards into my mouth by sucking hard at the back of my throat, and then spit it out.  Sparkling water helped in a way that normal water didn't, so you may find that worth a try. \n \nKeep posting if you want the support, there are lots of us here who really do know the need to persevere with the whole food thing, and we can at least be on hand for motivation and ideas.  Feel free to pm me if you want to chat more, I do know something about the psychological side too. \n \nBest wishes, \n \n\nJosie","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Cancer news","group":"Science"}],"title":"Forum Post: RE: I really need help with inability to eat","source":{"category":"Organisation","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Macmillan Cancer Support","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"374324016","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"36"},"name":"Macmillan Cancer Support","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Organisations"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.macmillan.org.uk/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201919356","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:03:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ChinchillaNews.com.au","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"606907322","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"ChinchillaNews.com.au","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.chinchillanews.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201923015","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T14:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557687z1_20170129162619_000g9dg4eu82-0-5o7dbx25uooe6wninn2_t325x200.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

That puts 12 players within two shots of the co-leaders. \n \nFormer Santa Margarita High star Beau Hossler, making his first PGA start as a professional at age 21, struggled to a 2-over 74 on Saturday to drop to even par, one shot ahead of Saturday\u2019s secondary cut, and is tied for 58th. \n \nSuffice it to say, it was much more surprising that tour stars Tiger Woods, Jason Day, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker all missed the 36-hole cut than it is that Snedeker is contending again at Torrey Pines. \n \n\u201cMy rookie year I finished third here and ever since then, it\u2019s had a special place in my heart,\u201d Snedeker said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to quantify, but I definitely think there are certain golf courses (where) you show up and your attitude \u2013 the way you go about things \u2013 and your confidence level kind of wills you to have a good week. . . . This is a place that I love and play great on.\u201d \n \nTwo of Snedeker\u2019s eight career tour victories came at Torrey Pines. He won the 2012 Farmers in a playoff after Kyle Stanley triple-bogeyed the 72nd hole to open the door for him, and he won last year\u2019s storm-delayed tournament after shooting 69 Sunday in a driving rain and heavy winds that suspended play and then watching the leaders falter on Monday. \n \nThe only two players who have won the Farmers more often are Woods (seven of his 79 tour titles) and Phil Mickelson (three of his 42 tour titles), who moved up the leaderboard to 18th Saturday after a third-round 68.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"RANDY YOUNGMAN"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: golf news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Co-leader Brandt Snedeker contends again at Farmers Insurance Open","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Orange","zipCode":"92660","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Newport Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southland Golf","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169734098","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4093"},"name":"Southland Golf","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","Golf"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.southlandgolfmagazine.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201926395","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:48:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We are waiting for the official confirmation,\u201d the official added, requesting anonymity. \n \nThe project, titled Mubarakpur Oil-Gas Exploration Well Drilling Project, has been riddled with  problems since its inception. \n \nMubarakpur was identified as a prospective gas exploration site after a five-year joint seismic survey conducted by Petrobangla and German company Prakla Seismos in 1984. \n \nHowever, the project was not initiated until 2006; the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) approved it on February 22, 2006 with a budget of Tk56.04 crore. \n \nEven then, the project did not take off after being approved and was later revised and the budget was increased to Tk89.26 crore, which Ecnec approved on March 30, 2010. \n \nThe project deadline was first set for June 2014 but the drilling did not begin until August 22, 2014. \n \nThis was the longest delay that any Bapex project has ever faced. \n \nThe deadline was later extended to June 2015 but the project could not meet that either due to several technical problems. \n \nThe first major problem that the project faced was in December 2014 when the drilling rig got stuck at approximately 4,200 metres due to a pipe casing problem, said another Bapex official. \n \n\u201cWe needed to dig a sidetrack well to continue the drilling, but it took several months to obtain the government approval for that well and for the added cost,\u201d he added. \n \nIn February last year, Bapex resumed the drilling work and found an eight-metre gas layer at a depth of 4,400 metres. \n \nThe company continued drilling but was forced to suspend it at 4,500-metre depth as it did not have adequate equipment to manage the high pressure of gas \u2013 around 10,500 PSIG \u2013 at that level. \n \nLater, they discovered that what they had thought to be gas at 4,500 metres was actually groundwater. \n \nIn addition, the drilling was suspended for nearly 15 months due to different glitches and bureaucratic tangles. Initially aiming to drill up to 4,700 metres under the surface, Bapex drilled 4,629 metres but were forced to stop. \n \nMubarakpur well is the first and only exploratory gas well in the northern region, the Bapex official said. \n \n\u201cThis is the only site which we found to have high prospects in terms of gas exploration. But we found that the gas flow pressure is not adequate here. Now we believe gas exploration is unlikely in this region,\u201d he added. \n \nSpeaking to the Dhaka Tribune, Badrul Imam, energy expert and professor at the geology department of Dhaka University, said it was unfortunate that the project had failed. \n \n\u201cSometimes, some gas exploratory wells do not have enough gas flow pressure for production,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cBapex should be free of bureaucratic tangles when implementing its projects for oil and gas exploration. The delays happened because Bapex had to explain the obstacles it faced during drilling to the Planning Commission in order to get the additional funds, which took several months.\u201d \n \nBapex has failed projects at Srikail in Comilla, Kapasia in Gazipur and Sunetra structure in Sunamganj-Netrakona, where it did not find gas in the exploratory wells. \n \nIt currently supplies 104 million cubic feet of gas to the national grid every day from seven gas fields in Saldanadi, Fenchuganj, Shahbazpur, Semutung, Sundalpur, Srikail and Begumganj. \n \nMd Nowshad Islam, managing director of Bapex, could not be reached for a comment when the Dhaka Tribune contacted him. ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Bangladesh news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Tk105cr down the drain","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"BD","country":"Bangladesh"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dhaka Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"396158750","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"76"},"name":"Dhaka Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dhakatribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201929458","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada,\" Trudeau said on Twitter. \n \nA second tweet, also timed to coincide with outrage over Trump's immigration policy, included a 2015 photo of Trudeau welcoming a Syrian refugee at a Canadian airport. \n \nConfusion abounded at airports around the world on Saturday as officials tried to interpret the new US rules. \n \nTrudeau's office said US authorities had confirmed Canadian passport holders, including dual citizens from the seven countries, would not be affected. \n \nTrudeau has walked a fine line with the Trump administration, avoiding direct criticism while promoting the progressive policies of his one-year-old Liberal government. \n \nThe prime minister would discuss Canada's immigration and refugee policies with Trump, Trudeau's press secretary, Cameron Ahmad, said. He did not say when that would be. \n \nWestJet Airlines said it turned back a passenger bound for the United States on Saturday to comply with Trump's executive order but did not say which country the passenger had come from.

While he had a visitor's visa, he missed the cutoff to travel by hours. \n \nHe decided not to risk flying from Saskatchewan in case he was detained on arrival in the United States. He said an Iranian friend who has been living in the US and working at NASA for years was detained at the Doha airport in Qatar late Friday. \n \n\"You don't want to put yourself in that situation, to go there and they ask you questions and just deport you,\" he said. \n \nIn Vancouver, an employee at the American Airlines counter said one person travelling on an Iranian passport had been turned away Saturday morning. \n \nAir Canada said it was complying with the order but did not comment on whether it had denied anyone travel. \n \nA Porter Airlines spokesman said the Toronto-based carrier will be restricting passengers from travelling to the United States from the listed countries until further notice.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Canada news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Canada welcomes refugees; US-bound passengers turned away","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"BD","country":"Bangladesh"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dhaka Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"396158750","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"76"},"name":"Dhaka Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dhakatribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201929718","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 42 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"40202","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Louisville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Louisville Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"540"},"name":"Louisville Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Recreation"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201932012","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport, were reportedly prevented from boarding despite holding valid immigration visas. \n \nIn The Netherlands, the Dutch flag carrier KLM said it had stopped seven passengers from boarding its flights, five of whom it had been able to contact before departure. The identities of the seven, their countries of origin and destinations were not given. \n \n\u201cWe would have liked to have had them fly with us, but it would not have made much sense because they would have been denied entry\u201d to the United States, KLM spokesman Manel Vrijenhoek told AFP news agency. \n \nIn Canada, WestJet Airlines said it turned back a passenger bound for the United States on Saturday in order to comply with an executive order that prohibits people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. \n \nWestJet spokeswoman Lauren Stewart said the airline would give full refunds to anyone affected by the US executive order. It did not say which country the passenger had come from. \n \nIn Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, two travel agencies told AFP they had been instructed by Etihad Airways, Emirates and Turkish Airlines not to sell US tickets or allow Iranians holding American visas to board US-bound flights. \n \nQatar Airways on Saturday issued a  travel alert  on their official website, saying nationals of the seven countries may travel to the US \u201conly if they are in possession of a permanent resident card [Green card] or any of the below visas,\u201d listing foreign government, United Nations, international organisation and NATO visas. \n \nAcross the Middle East, people reacted with fury saying the travel curbs were insulting and discriminatory. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not right to portray huge groups of Arabs and Muslims as possible terrorists,\u201d Najeeb Haidari, a Yemeni-American security manager in Yemen, told Reuters news agency. \n \n\u201cThis is a stupid, terrible decision which will hurt the American people more than us or anybody else, because it shows that this president can\u2019t manage people, politics or global relationships.\u201d \n \nIn Baghdad, Bayan Adil, a doctor working in the Iraqi Health Ministry who applied for a US visa to attend a medical seminar, said Iraqi academics should visit Europe instead of the United States, where they were no longer welcome. \n \n\u201cTrump\u2019s decision is unfortunately a humiliating insult not only for us as academics but for all Iraqis,\u201d she told Reuters. \n \nIran also slammed the \u201cinsulting\u201d measure and said it would stop US citizens entering the country in retaliation to Washington\u2019s visa ban, calling it an \u201copen affront against the Muslim world and the Iranian nation\u201d. \n \n ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MT Webmaster"},"topics":[],"title":"Fury as airlines bar passengers from flying to US","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"MY","country":"Malaysia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Malaysia Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669953","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"151"},"name":"Malaysia Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.malaysia-today.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/world-leaders-condemn-donald-trump-muslim-ban-170128134635041.html","http://www.qatarairways.com/qa/en/travel-alerts.page"],"sequenceId":"695201932582","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:43Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.malaysia-today.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Trump.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The apex consumer commission has directed real-estate major Unitech Hi-Tech Developers Ltd to pay over Rs three crore to a couple for failing to give them possession of an apartment booked under one of its housing projects at Noida in 2010. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) asked the firm to refund the payment of Rs 3.33 crore made by the complainants while purchasing the flat and compensate them in the form of interest at 10 per cent per annum with effect from 2012. The commission, while deciding the complaint, rejected the claim of Unitech group of companies that the delay in handing over the flats to the buyers was on account of agitation by farmers and shortage of labour. According to the complaint, the couple had booked a residential flat in project Burgundy, developed by Unitech in Sector 96-98 in Noida and were allotted the apartment on Level 6 in Tower-1 on August 27, 2010 for a total consideration of Rs 3.39 crore, out of which the complainants had already paid Rs 3.33 crore to the firm.\n\n\u201cAs regards the alleged shortage of labour, no material has been placed on record to show that it (Unitech) could not get adequate work force to complete the construction of the flats despite efforts having been made in this regard,\u201d the NCDRC said.\n\nRegarding the claim of delay due to farmers agitation, the commission said, \u201c\u2026there is no evidence of the work at this particular site having been halted by farmers. No affidavit of the contractor engaged by the opposite party for construction of the flats in this project has been filed to prove that he had to halt the work on account of agitation by farmers.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Unitech to refund Rs 3.33 crore to homebuyer","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Indian Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660698","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"Indian Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201932818","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:36Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/01/unitech-discuss-appointment480.jpg?w=480"},{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/01/unitech-discuss-appointment480.jpg?w=450"}],"video":[]}}

A woman\u2019s footwear without a back strap is a sandal, the Delhi High Court has ruled opposing the government\u2019s contention that it was a \u2018chappal\u2019. The issue assumed significance as the export of sandals attract a 10 per cent customs duty drawback, while that of \u2018chappals\u2019 attracted only five per cent duty. The government had withdrawn a 10 per cent duty drawback given to a footwear manufacturer saying the footwear exported by it were \u2018chappals\u2019 as these did not have back strap. The Delhi High Court, while ruling that these were sandals, quashed the government\u2019s decision. Disagreeing with the government\u2019s view, a bench of justices S Ravindra Bhat and Najmi Waziri ruled, \u201cThe respondents (Centre and the Revenue Department), in our opinion, acted upon prejudice and a preconceived notion that ladies sandals cannot be without a back strap\u201d. It said in view of the totality of circumstances, \u201cthis court is of the opinion that the impugned orders, upholding duty drawback withdrawal and imposing penalty cannot be sustained. They are hereby quashed\u201d.\n\nThe court said that an expert body, Council of Leather Exports which routinely dealt with such issues in context of export, had, based on evidence and instructions of government, furnished an opinion that goods were sandals and not chappals.\n\nIt also said there was no evidence to hold that the Council\u2019s opinion was insufficient.\n\n\u201cApart from these, the court wonders whether any of the experts in this case was a woman, the ultimate customer. In such cases, the commercial parlance test would predominate,\u201d the bench observed.\n\nThe court\u2019s order came on a plea by Chennai-based footwear manufacturer, Wishall International, challenging the government\u2019s position that a woman\u2019s footwear without a back strap was a chappal and not a sandal.\n\nThe firm in May 2003 had filed a shipping bill to export the consignment declared as \u201cladies leather sandals\u201d claiming 10 per cent customs duty drawback. The Customs Department here, however, had said the export consignment were chappals.\n\nThe company, however, had sought opinion from the Council of Leather Exports which had cleared the export consignment as sandals.\n\nBut the Customs department approached the Council that sought the opinion of Footwear Design and Development Institute (FDDI), which ruled that the products were chappals.\n\nFollowing this, the Customs served a show-cause notice on the company, demanding recovery of the drawback already paid at 10 per cent as well as a penalty.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Women\u2019s footwear without back strap is sandal, not chappal: High Court","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Indian Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660698","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"Indian Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201938387","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:08:07Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/thinkstock-sandal-chappal-copy.jpg?w=480"},{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/thinkstock-sandal-chappal-copy.jpg?w=450"}],"video":[]}}

I am with Her,\u201d O\u2019Grady had said, referring to Hillary Clinton. The Secret Service has now placed the senior special agent on administrative leave while the agency investigates her social media activities.\n\nAn agency spokeswoman on Friday was quoted as saying that the management action, which takes the agent off the job with pay while the investigation proceeds. The move is a sign that the agency is taking the investigation against O\u2019Grady seriously. Critics, however, question why it took the agency three months to initiate the probe. The Secret Service on Wednesday announced that it was formally investigating the special agent.\n\nThe Secret Service said its Office of Professional Responsibility, or RES, its main internal ethics entity, is investigating the matter. Joseph Clancy, the director of the Secret Service, sent an email to all employees notifying them of the formal probe, and asking them for \u201cpatience while the RES conducts their investigation.\u201d O\u2019Grady is a special agent in charge of the Secret Service\u2019s Denver district, oversees coordination with Washington-based advance teams for all presidential candidate and presidential trips to the area, including all upcoming or future trips by the president, vice president or Trump administration officials.\n\nDespite her senior security role, she has made her disdain for Trump and his incoming administration clear to her Facebook followers. O\u2019Grady told the website that she took down her post after two or three days of reflecting on it, adding that she does not believe her social media antics would impact her \u201cdevotion to mission and country.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Secret agent probed for \u2018won\u2019t take bullet for Donald Trump\u2019 post","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Indian Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660698","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"Indian Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201938839","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:06Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:09:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/president-trump-480.jpg?w=480"},{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/president-trump-480.jpg?w=450"}],"video":[]}}

The combative allrounder who hits the ball with vengeful fury, bowls close to 90mph, throws himself around the field. The fiery redhead who likes a word with the opposition and won't back down from confrontation. The tattooed bruiser who punches lockers, likes a drink and trades as often in the idiotic as in the inspirational. \n \nStokes made his England debut more than five years ago but is still young enough to be cast as brash and unthinking. He charges into battle, feuds with other players , and picks up suspension points from the ICC. \n \nBut there are, of course, other sides to this 25-year-old career sportsman. A dedicated father of two, Stokes has been with his girlfriend, Clare, since he was 19 and freely admits to tears at the birth of his son, Layton. He is honest about needing to speak to a psychologist when dealing with anger and frustration, and says he wept in the shower after the poor tour of Sri Lanka that led to him missing out on the 2015 World Cup . \n \nThese are some of the insights provided in his autobiography, Firestarter . Like with others before him, the temptation to release a book while his star was in the ascendant overrode concerns that he might not have much to say. That is not so much of an issue for Stokes, though, whose career to date has not been short of incident. For someone who clearly prefers doing to talking, he is also gratifyingly open about his successes and failures - for which his ghostwriter, Richard Gibson, should take plenty of credit. \n  \n\"Like Botham and Flintoff before him, Stokes is a full-throttle competitor with a self-destructive streak\" \n  \n\"Where I am concerned, there will be moments of heartache but also moments of great triumph,\" he writes early on, having gone straight in with an account of being hit for four consecutive sixes in the World T20 final . The image of Stokes crouched, head in hands, with Joe Root providing an arm on the shoulder after England's defeat to West Indies is powerful but it does not feel like it will end up defining him, not least because he is intent on throwing himself back into the thick of it at every opportunity. \"It might be penthouse one day, shithouse the next, but it will never be for want of trying.\" \n \nThe fire in Stokes has, it seems, also helped forge a tougher, increasingly mature character. When discussing an unfortunate dismissal against Afghanistan in the World T20 group stage, he invokes Mario Balotelli and his \"Why Always Me?\" T-shirt. But while Balotelli has struggled to fulfil his potential for club or country, Stokes has developed into one of the most influential players in the England dressing room, serving as vice-captain during the recent ODI series in Bangladesh, and an equally passionate performer for the county he grew up with, Durham. \n \nEven his outbursts of volatility have become more controlled: breaking a bat is far preferable to breaking a bone, as Stokes infamously did when tangling with a Kensington Oval locker in 2014. He now attempts to deal with the disappointment of getting out by methodically packing his kitbag, after discussions with England's psychologist, Mark Bawden. \n Poignant though it may be, the image of a distraught Stokes being comforted after receiving a caning is not likely to be the defining image of him  AFP \nIt was to Bawden he turned at a pivotal juncture in 2013, when attempting to overcome a slump in form. Issues such as performance anxiety are much better understood nowadays - not least because of personal accounts like that of Jonathan Trott, the man Stokes replaced for his Test debut - and his candour is impressive: \n \nSharing my innermost thoughts was not a weakness at all, as it turned out. Leaving them to fester was only going to make the situation worse, Mark explained\u2026 He told me that I was suffering from Bottle, Bottle, Bang syndrome. In other words, I kept storing up everything in a certain bottle - inside of me, effectively - and I was bubbling it up until that bottle went bang and I exploded with frustration. Instead of letting this happen, I had to find another way of dealing with it. \nAt the start of that year, Stokes' stocks had dipped sharply when he was sent home from an England Lions tour of Australia for indulging in one too many late nights - \"the worst bollocking actually came from Clare\" - and with Andy Flower questioning whether he was serious about adding to the handful of limited-overs caps he had won in 2011. He ended it by becoming one of the few success stories of England's troubled 2013-14 Ashes tour . \n Cover image of Ben Stokes' Firestarter   Headline \nBut that was not the start of a smooth upward curve: less than 12 months later, under Flower's successor Peter Moores, he felt he \"was being strangled as a player\" after being asked to bat at No. 8. \n  \nThe Stokes journey has been more eventful than most, from growing up as a rebellious and adventurous youngster in New Zealand, to forging a path as one of cricket's most exciting talents with his adopted country. Like Botham and Flintoff before him, Stokes is a full-throttle competitor with a self-destructive streak, but after a turbulent start with England, his on-field exploits are starting to take centre stage, be it the take-it-on-the-chin trauma of Kolkata or his stand-and-destroy innings of 258 in Cape Town a few weeks earlier - the second-fastest double-hundred in Test history. \n \nAfterwards, he records in Firestarter , he sat down and wrote the wrong score (257) on a souvenir stump, in permanent marker. \"That's me, I guess: brilliant one minute, useless the next.\" However you want to categorise Ben Stokes, he offers a pretty compelling story. \n \nFirestarter: Me, Cricket and the Heat of the Moment \nBy Ben Stokes \nHeadline \n293 pages, £2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Alan Gardner"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Categorically Ben","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"ESPN.co.uk","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657842","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"65"},"name":"ESPN.co.uk","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Cricket","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.espn.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/311158.html","http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/1057539.html","http://www.espncricinfo.com/india-v-england-2016-17/content/story/1069084.html","http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015/content/story/812329.html","http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-2016/content/story/994611.html","http://www.espncricinfo.com/bangladesh-v-england-2016-17/content/story/1060923.html","http://www.espncricinfo.com/west-indies-v-england-2013-14/content/story/727981.html","http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/series/592392.html","http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/800463.html"],"sequenceId":"695201943188","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T12:53:21Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:10:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days. That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.\n\nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.\n\nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government.\n\nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.\n\n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\"\n\nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.\n\n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said.\n\n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\"\n\nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. An has temporarily stopped the government from sending those who landed with valid visas out of the country.\n\nCrowds of protesters have gathered at US airports in response to the order and subsequent detainments.

She has won 10 major titles since turning 30 and has made eight out of the last grand slam 10 finals. \n \nWilliams believes she is in the form of her life. \n \n\"I was thinking yesterday on the practice court, 'gosh I'm playing better than I have ever before I think',\" Williams said. \n \n\"I'm moving better, I've always been a fast mover but I stopped moving a bit in the middle of my career because I was like, I don't have to move so much. \n \n\"But I was like, 'man I'm hitting really well'. It feels good to be playing this well at the moment.\" \n \nBy her own high standards, 2016 represented a disappointing season for Williams. \n \nThe American only added a Wimbledon title to her tally and also surrendered the world number one spot to Angelique Kerber after a shock US Open defeat to Karolina Pliskova. \n \n\"Winning this one was very important,\" Williams' coach Patrick Mouratoglou said. \n \n\"I feel when you end the season with a loss, especially in a grand slam, you cannot feel the same way and cannot have a good feeling. \n \n\"She had confidence but not the same kind as when you win. That's why this one was very important for the rest of the season.\" \n \nWilliams has struggled at times with the weight of expectation, crumbling at the 2015 US Open when a calendar grand slam was in sight and then stumbling again there in September when on the brink of breaking Graf's record. \n \nShe has appeared far more relaxed in Melbourne, on and off court, with her new fiance Alexis Ohanian here supporting from her box throughout. \n \n\"I've been trying to live it for some time now, this tournament I was able to do it,\" Williams said. \n \n\"I was okay with not losing but I also knew I didn't have to win here to make my career. It settled with me this time. I don't know why I felt like that but I want to know because I want it again.\" \n \nSurpassing Graf's 22 major triumphs adds statistical weight to the now almost indisputable argument that Williams is the greatest female player of all time. \n \nShe could pass Court's mark at Wimbledon this summer, although 13 of the Australian's 24 successes came before the Open era, when grand slams were still not fully professional. \n \n\"Graf's record is more important because with all the respect for Margaret Court, it's another era,\" Mouratoglou said. \n \n\"The draws were like 16 players, they were not professionals. Of course the record is there and we definitely want to beat it but there is a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf. \n \n\"Serena was not motivated by 22, she was motivated by grand slams. That's her motivation. \n \n\"This won't change until one day she wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams but for now she is, so that's enough. \n \n\"Is that day close? I don't think so. I am not in her head but I don't think so.\" \n \nWilliams did take some motivation from reclaiming her place at the top of the world rankings, which she will when the list refreshes on Monday. \n \nTo avoid adding any extra pressure, however, Mouratoglou told his charge at the start of the tournament that victory would not return her to number one. \n \n\"In the beginning of the tournament, I was like, 'if I win, will I be number one?'\" Williams said. \n \n\"Patrick said, 'no, no, no.' So I was like whatever. Then on the court when they were said, 'and number one', I was like, 'whoa, really'?\" \n \nWilliams later added: \"Kerber played unbelievable, she definitely deserved to have that position. I t didn't hurt or p*** me off, to me it just looked weird. I'd never felt like number two.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena Williams: I'm in the best form of my life after 23rd grand slam","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Dyfed","zipCode":"SA62","state":"Wales","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Pembrokeshire","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wales Farmer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"612927585","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Wales Farmer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.walesfarmer.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201950961","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:10:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It's not all doom and gloom. \n \n\"We have got some work to do because we are in a hole. The only way you can get out of the hole is to grab a spade and dig. We will work and get out of that hole.\" \n \nLeicester, who scored three tries through Will Evans, Dom Barrow and Harry Thacker, led 24-8 with 11 minutes left but had to hold off a late Northampton rally. \n \nNafi Tuitavake and Rory Hutchinson added to a first-half try by Harry Mallinder but it was too late for the Saints, who face a tough ask making it out of Pool One. \n \nNorthampton academy coach Mark Hopley said: \"We're disappointed with the way we performed in the first half.

'Kaabil' itself has seen a steady escalation in collections courtesy excellent word of mouth and critical reviews. However, 'Raees' has clearly been the winner. \n \nAnd the 4th day collections of the two films has only established this fact. \n \nAccording to boxofficeindia.com, while 'Raees,' earned a commendable 15.50 crore rupees (approx.), Kaabil manged a decent 10.75 crore rupees (approx.). This has taken the tally of 'Raees' to a mammoth 75 crore nett., as against 'Kaabil's 41.75 crore nett., thereby giving the former a near 34 crore rupees lead. \n \nWhile industry was expecting a surprise overture from 'Kaabil,' as had been seen during the 'Bajirao Mastani'-'Dilwale' clash when the former gradually overtook the latter's gargantuan domestic opening domestically, it hasn't been the case. \n \n'Kaabil' needs to stay extremely steady in the coming week on working days to recover its cost, but the clash by now has its sure-shot winner.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Box-office day 4: Raees takes a mind-boggling 34 crore lead over Kaabil","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Deccan Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673440","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"137"},"name":"Deccan Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201958813","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:10:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

When focusing their learning on what has gone before, how do we know that we are teaching them the right things for what comes next?\"\n\nThe focus, according to Mr Caller, may be better applied to a child's individual talents and skills, using creativity and adapting to advancements in technology and new information as they happen. \n\nMr Caller said: \"In private tutoring, we see time after time how focusing on a child's individual interests and talents, and adapting teaching styles and lesson planning to compliment them, results in a child who is more interested and eager to learn. Tutors International is now seeing clients who are already starting to look for 'outside the box' thinkers when selecting their private tutors [2]. They want someone who can expose their child to a wide range of topics, concepts and ideas from an early age, and use new advancements in technology to their learning advantage. They want someone who can 'move with the times', and this paves the way for some very exciting job opportunities for forward thinking tutors, worldwide.\"\n\nWith a career in education spanning over 25 years, Mr Caller believes that embracing these latest developments and incorporating them into a child's own individual curriculum, while prioritising their creativity and nurturing a natural curiosity, is key in shaping adults that can use their own skills to adapt and succeed in a world that their teachers may never get to experience. \n\nTutors International places exceptional tutors with families based on their individual needs and circumstances.

None of these laid our vision of how we thought the process should be addressed. With our focus on legal technology and its application our advice is naturally more on the practical than legal. However, we have represented the legal framework as much as we need to within the LTPI purview. We've all witnessed too many drive-by Meet & Confers when one sides ignorance of the process led to shoddy client representation. With this guide, there is no longer any excuse.\" \n\nThe guide is broken into 4 stages: pre-conference, activities at the conference, post conference, and \"common pitfalls\", providing practical guidance and checklist items and related strategic considerations to streamline the process and avoid any missed steps. It is a valuable resource to both the novice and the expert. \n\nThe project team members include Bob Rohlf (Exterro), Peter Pepiton (Dinsmore), Chris Paskach (The Claro Group), P.

On Thursday's Morning Drive on the Golf Channel, live at the Orange County Convention Center, the  Sirius took center stage along with big industry names like Club Car, E-Z-Go, and Garia. \n\nAlthough primarily associated with golf, the golf car industry now encompasses a wide range of small vehicles from LSVs (a street legal low-speed vehicle) to utility vehicles to the classic golf course companion.  kept the golf course-to-neighborhood overlap in mind with the ground-up creation of the new Sirius model, which boasts automotive conveniences like an electronic locking trunk, USB port, LED illuminated dashboard, and self-cancelling turn signals. But it is still golf course worthy, with optional golf ball holder inserts, and a large bagwell, or the option of a 2-in-1 Combo Seat (a patented design that turns a rear seat into a golf bag holder without tools). \n\nSTAR EV revealed two prototypes at its PGA show exhibit; a standard Sirius with 2-in-1 Combo Seat, and a \"tricked-out\" version to show how customizable the Sirius will be. The front trunk gives the golf car the look of a hood that can be painted a different color from the main body, like the sleek matte black trunk on the deep metallic maroon prototype. STAR EV also offers a variety of wheels, with rim finishes in machined aluminum, matte black, dura chrome, black PVD, and special color accents. \n\nWhile the models at the show were standard 2 and 4-passenger vehicles, the Sirius line will expand to include 6 and 8 passenger models like the STAR EV Classic. As all STAR's vehicles, the Sirius is 100% electric with a 4 kW AC motor, 350 A Curtis AC controller, and can travel at a top speed of 19.5 mph. (The LSV version peaks at 25 mph.) The line officially launches in the summer of 2017, available through any of STAR's 250+  nationwide and internationally. \n\nRead the full story at","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Biotech news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Retail industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Health care industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Radio industry news","group":"Media"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: golf news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"New Sirius model from STAR Electric Vehicles makes its debut at PGA Merchandise Show","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"BioSpace","feed":{"genre":"Press Release","tags":[],"id":"169669304","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1307"},"name":"BioSpace","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","HealthCare","Biotechnology","Wires","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.biospace.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201973126","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T11:06:14Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:10:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

For two years, he popped into David Christopher's firm to see her. \n \n\"I would say how about selling me that car, Mr Christopher?\" recalls Bert. \n \n\"He would reply, 'Oh, no, no, no laddie, I couldn't do that'.\" \n \nLike a would-be suitor, Bert visited the object of his affection often, politely pestering David, until eventually he gave in. \n \n\"Alright laddie, you can have it,\" David agreed. \"How much have you got in your pocket?\" \n \nThe sale went through for £15. \n   \nThere were only 1000 of the Humber 9/28 classics manufactured between 1928 and 1930 and Bert had one of them. \n \nToday, there are only around 12 left that have survived the years intact. \n \n\"She wasn't in bad condition at all being under a sheet for all those years,\" says Bert. \n \n\"I put a battery in and drove her straight home.\" \n \nBert worked on his beloved car until she shone. Her engine, he says, sounded reasonably quiet. \n \nWhich is why when a friend suggested he compete in the Kildrummy Rally - a newly launched vintage car road show - he jumped at the chance. \n \nHis burgundy lady didn't let him down. \n \nIn 1959, Bert Davidson drove to glory in his saloon, registration SO 3898, and took home first place in his class. \n \n\"It was a lovely day,\" he says fondly. \"I was the only kilted competitor there.\" \n \nA few years later though, the sale of his father's garage in Elgin forced an unwelcome separation. \n \n\"When my father sold the garage I had nowhere to keep the car and I sold it to someone from the RAF at Kinloss,\" says Bert. \n   \nIt was a tough call to make. Over the next 60 years, Bert went one way and his beloved car went the other. \n \nMarriage, children, work and retirement came to Bert. \n \nThen a phone call from out of the blue brought back the past. \n \n\"A man called Rob in Durham rang me up,\" says Bert, now 83. \"He told me he thought he had my old car. It was a bit of a shock.\" \n \nThat man was Robin Wills, the final in a line of several gentlemen who had cared for Bert's classy burgundy gal over her lifetime. \n   \nWhile Bert remained in Scotland, his car had crossed the Atlantic four times, spent time under the ownership of one of the principal designers of Lotus sports cars and made her movie debut in the 1976 film The Likely Lads. \n \nRobin, whose father owned the car in the mid-1960s and early 1970s, was working on the vehicle when he noticed a badge inside from the rally of 1959. \n \n\"After searching the internet, I found a film of this rally on the Scottish Film Archives,\" he says. \n \n\"The film quite clearly shows our car and has an excellent shot at the end where its owner takes the cup for the best vintage vehicle. The entrant - Mr Bert Davidson.\" \n   \nRobin managed to track down Bert, who was described on the film as the only kilted competitor, to tell him his car lives on and to offer him one more chance to get behind the wheel once again. \n \n\"I'm intending to bring it up at Easter time to reunite it with him,\" says Robin. \n \n\"It will be quite a special moment when he sees it.\" \n \nOver the last year, Robin and Bert have kept in touch. They share the same birthday, November 19, which Robin marked by sending Bert his old number plate from the car he loved as a 80th birthday present. \n \nAlthough Bert last drove the car nearly 60 years ago, he can still remember its crash gearbox, the position of the gear lever, the bench seat in the front which made down into a bed, and, most importantly, how it felt to be behind its wheel. \n   \n\"I was young and single back then,\" Bert laughs. \"\"It drove well, not like a modern car of course, it had a crash gear box you had cope with. \n \n\"It also only had breaks on the back wheels.\" \n \nBert says he was surprised but delighted to hear from Robin and cannot wait to see both his new friend and his old car when they travel up to Elgin this Easter. \n \n\"I have one or two photographs of the car from back then,\" says Bert. \n \n\"I didn't know I was in a video though until Rob told me. I'm very much looking forward to seeing her again.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Together again: Bert reunites with beloved car after six decades","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Glasgow","zipCode":"G51","state":"Scotland","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Glasgow City","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"STV.tv","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663216","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"STV.tv","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stv.tv/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201975881","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:10:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://images.stv.tv/articles/w768xh432xmFit/512751-bert-davidson-humber-saloon.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 43 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"40202","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Louisville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Louisville Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"540"},"name":"Louisville Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201976092","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:10:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It explains that liposuction and liposculpture can be used to help hone patients bodies to the image they want. \n \nBrooklyn, United States \u2013 January 29, 2017 /PressCable/ \u2014 \n \nA Long Island liposuction, cosmetic, skin and laser surgery center has launched a new report on the benefits of liposuction and liposculpture as a way to gently reshape the body. Doctor Rokhsar, who runs the surgery, is at the forefront of research and teaching and lectures regularly on cosmetic procedures. His latest report focuses on how the service can be a way to remove unwanted fat stores safely and gently. \n \nMore information can be found at: http://platinumpeakseo.com/Longislandliposuction . \n \nThe site explains that, unlike many practices, the Long Island cosmetic surgery is not a one pony show. It boasts over 40 lasers and energy based devices in its world class centers in both Manhattan and Long Island. \n \nWhile some centers will seek to sell their services, patients at the New York Cosmetic, Skin & Laser Surgery Center will never get a sales pitch. The center will give them a realistic expectation about the outcome of procedures they are contemplating, and from there they can make the best decision for themselves. \n \nDr Rokhsar is certified in dermatology and has completed additional training in cosmetic surgery fellowship. He explains that anyone considering liposuction in the New York area should be sure to ask their doctor if they are board certified in dermatology or plastic surgery. This is because a medical degree doesn\u2019t qualify doctors to practice in the field of lasers and cosmetic surgery. \n \nThe new report explains that liposculpture and liposuction remove excess fat from the thighs, buttocks, abdomen, waistline, arms, knees, ankles, calves, cheeks, jowls and neck. Liposculpture offers more precise sculpting through using smaller instruments for the process. \n \nThis works because it relies on tumescent fluid to numb the fat as well as to help liquefy it, allowing the doctor to remove it through small cannulas. It allows for fine sculpting of the body so local patients can better get the shape they desire. \n \nFull details of the Long Island liposuction services available at New York Cosmetic, Skin & Laser Surgery Center can be found by visiting the URL above. \n \nContact Info: \nName: Chris Hayes \nOrganization: Virtual Heroics \nAddress: 2440 East 29th Street, Brooklyn, 11235 United States \n \nFor more information, please visit http://www.virtualheroics.com \n \nSource: PressCable \n \nRelease ID: 165208 \n \n\n \nThis article was originally distributed via SproutNews.

The new service is a low moisture method of cleaning carpets that leaves them clean and quick drying. \n \n\n \nJoplin, United States \u2013 January 29, 2017 /PressCable/ \u2014 \n \nCrystal Clean Carpets, based in Joplin, have launched a new low moisture carpet cleaning service. This new service does not soak the carpets leaving them dry within the hour saving customers valuable time. \n \nFor more information please visit: http://carpetcleaningjoplin.net . \n \nCrystal Clean Carpets is owner operated and the owner, Alan Snider, will personally answer phone calls to ensure customer satisfaction. The website explains that they are the premier low moisture and upholstery cleaners for Joplin, Carthage, and the surrounding area in South West Missouri. \n \nModern carpets can hold up to a pound of dirt per square foot and this dirt consists of dust, allergens, pollen and other impurities. The site states that not only does cleaning carpets restore them to looking their best, it also helps to keep the home healthy and hygienic. \n \nCrystal Clean Carpets help homeowners to achieve carpet cleanliness by using a low moisture cleaning system rather than the traditional hot water extraction method. The hot water extraction method involves thoroughly soaking the carpet leaving it wet for hours, as well as trailing hoses through the home. With this method stains and spots often re-appear. \n \nThe low moisture method `uses patented technology to aggressively agitate the carpet without damaging the fibers meaning that less water is needed leaving carpets dry within an hour. Another benefit of using less water is that carpets are not soaked through and that means that stains do not wick back and re-appear. They use a machine that is self contained and does not trail hoses through customers houses bringing disruption to a minimum. \n \nCrystal Clean Carpets do not use soap and modern low moisture cleaning chemicals are 96% biodegradable, making it an earth friendly option. They also leave carpets with no sticky residue and are safe for children and pets. \n \nThe company also offers services that include upholstery and pet odor.

Two primary features of the app include the ability of users to easily renew their passport and their ability to take passport photos \n \n\n \nNew York , United States \u2013 January 29, 2017 /PressCable/ \u2014 \n \nItsEasy.com, a leading provider of passport and visa expediting services founded by visionary David Alwadish in 1976, is revolutionizing the passport and visa expediting industry with their passport renewal app. \n \nWith the 10-year anniversary of the Western Hemisphere Initiative passed in 2007, requiring Americans to have a passport for air travel to and from Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, the U.S. State Department expects to have approximately 16 million passport renewals in 2016 and 20 million in 2017 \u2013 an unprecedented amount. With the ItsEasy app, U.S. passport holders will have the power and convenience of facilitating their passport renewal process at their fingertips at any location \u2013 at home, at work, anywhere \u2013 with their iPhone/IPad and Android. \n \n\u201cThis is truly an exciting time for ItsEasy. We\u2019ve been working on this app for quite some time; perfecting it, adding new components to it and bettering it in general. I wanted to create an app that allowed U.S. passport holders to renew their passport with ease from their iPhone in a beneficial, secure, and easy way,\u201d said David Alwadish, CEO and President of ItsEasy.com. \u201cThis is truly an app that all passport holders should have downloaded for free on their iPhones, and Androids. The app is more than a passport renewal app and includes other features such as passport photos, visa requirements, an emergency info button (for travelers who lose their passport or visa while in another country), and a passport renewal reminder feature that will remind users via email to renew their passport nine months before their passport expires.\u201d \n \nThe free for download ItsEasy Passport Renewal App is safe, secure, confidential, user friendly, and is based upon the company\u2019s exceptional 40-year reputation. The two primary features of the app include the ability of users to easily renew their passport, and their ability to take passport photos which are then reviewed and approved by qualified ItsEasy passport professionals. Travelers in need of only photos have the option to have their passport photos printed by ItsEasy and delivered by first class or overnight mail, or have them emailed electronically to be printed by the user. \n \nWhen using the app, prior to the applicant\u2019s passport renewal order being completed, and in addition to the Department of State\u2019s passport fee, ItsEasy charges an honest fee of $29.95 for their services. Considering the value, the price is well worth the investment. The passport photo feature alone saves $10-$15 as well as the savings in time, travel and wait at the post office or drugstore for passport photos. Additionally, the app features trackable priority United States Postal Service shipping label a cost savings of approximately $6.45 and 24/7 customer support plus the peace of mind of knowing you used the correct forms and order status updates. Users are provided with the choice of two renewal processing time frames \u2013 standard approximately (6 to 8 week) and expedited (2 to 3 weeks.) \n \nOnce the order is completed through the app, ItsEasy will instantly email the customer the correct passport application to be printed and completed, a simple checklist and a secure trackable USPS priority shipping label to send the documents into ItsEasy for reviewing and processing. The professionals at ItsEasy will then deliver all necessary documents to the U.S. Department of State, who issues all passports and passport cards. \n \nAlwadish added, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want an app that saves you precious time and money? Between buying the envelope, postage, passport photos and running around for the errand, if the value of the users\u2019 time saved is factored in then the savings would grow exponentially! We are providing you with peace of mind with government approved and regulated experts handling the entire process\u2014including pre-checking of documents, printing the photos, writing the check and gathering what you\u2019d have to go buy yourself \u2013 you\u2019re in safe hands and we can advise you every step of the way. I can confidently say that you\u2019ll be aware of where your application is at all times.\u201d \n \nIn addition to the 10-year anniversary of the Western Hemisphere Initiative approaching, creating the passport renewal surge, the U.S. Department of State also recently announced the elimination of visa page inserts for U.S. passports beginning this year. Previously, U.S. passport holders had the option to pay for the insertion of additional 24-page visa inserts when valid passports lacked adequate space for entry or exit visa stamps. However, now applicants in need of additional pages in their passports will have to obtain a renewal \u2013 making this app even more relevant for U.S. travelers. \n \nFor more information on ItsEasy, the new app and other services, visit the website at https://www.itseasy.com/ or call 1-866-ITS-EASY.

This involves sitting quietly for 20 minutes, twice a day, until you reach \u201cpure consciousness\u201d, and singer Katy Perry has recently been touting the stress-relieving benefits of the practice. Find a therapist in Dubai at tm.ae. \n\nBlack garlic \n\nCaramel-y and with a savoury punch, black garlic has long been a staple in Korea, but it\u2019s fast gaining popularity across the rest of the world thanks to its health benefits (it has nearly twice the antioxidants of fresh garlic). It\u2019s made by heating regular garlic cloves slowly over several weeks until they caramelise to give a sweeter, gentler flavour (and no garlic breath \u2013 bonus!). Black garlic is available at Spinneys or online at desertcart.ae. \n\nRead: \n\nAdaptogens \u2013 stress-fighting herbs and mushrooms \u2013 are having a moment in the wellness world, and the star of the show is undoubtedly ashwagandha. This is the supplement chlorella-popping health bunnies will be turning to this year to reduce stress and improve sleep quality. Order online at desertcart.ae. \n\nFollowing on from our obsession with de-cluttering which spiked with Marie Kondo\u2019s best-selling book, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, smudging is the new way to cleanse your space. The ancient ceremony of burning sacred plants (sage is a fave) to combat stagnant or negative energy has been lauded by everyone from Vogue to Hollywood stars like Uma Thurman. Buy sage smudge sticks online at desertcart.ae. \n\nMushroom elixir \n\nBear with us on this one, but mushroom coffee is officially \u201ca thing\u201d. Health aficionados have taken to adding mushroom to their daily caffeine hit, claiming it packs a nutritional punch and provides a daily dose of stress-relieving minerals \u2013 minus the coffee jitters. Apparently the mushroom flavour is undetectable, too. Good news \u2013 Four Sigmatic, a leading company in the mushroom-coffee market, ships to the UAE. Order online at us.foursigmatic.com. \n\nAvocado oil \n\nMove over coconut oil, avocado oil is the healthy cooking condiment du jour. It\u2019s said to be great for lowering blood pressure and helping relieve arthritis and psoriasis. Drizzle it over your salad, over vegetables before roasting or drop a tablespoon into your smoothie. Available at souq.com. \n\nForest bathing \n\nThe Japanese ritual of shinrin-yoku or forest bathing \u2013 essentially being among the trees \u2013 started in 1982, but three decades on, forest bathing clubs are popping up everywhere from San Francisco to New York. There are even spas, resorts, retreat centres, gardens and parks offering guided \u201cforest bathing\u201d tours. It\u2019s a little like hiking, but with a healthy dose of mindfulness thrown in for good measure, and it\u2019s all about reducing stress and boosting your wellbeing. We might be short of forests in the UAE, but it\u2019s all about getting outdoors and experiencing nature. Try Abu Dhabi\u2019s Wathba Wetland Reserve, ead.ae/pages/al-wathba-wetland-2.aspx. \n\nFloatation therapy \n\nFollowing on from our obsession with meditation, floatation therapy is all about getting alone with your thoughts. And by alone we mean in an Epsom salt bath inside a dark pod without light or noise. Not convinced? Not only will it help you let go of mental anxiety but it can also ease muscle and joint pain. Try it in Abu Dhabi\u2019s Point Zero Floatation Centre, pointzerofloatation.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"The 8 Wellness Trends You\u2019ll Be Obsessed With In 2017","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Emirates Woman","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"317247470","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"36"},"name":"Emirates Woman","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.emirateswoman.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695201980484","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:10:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\"Mr. President, look at us,\" said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \"This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American.\" \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \"We are all immigrants!\" and \"No ban! No wall!\" \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \"What's happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\" \n \nAirport arrests \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \"President Trump's new Muslim ban.\" \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n \n\"This executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\" he said in a statement. \n \nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \"Portland coffee comes from Yemen,\" one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n \nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \"hashtag activist\" but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n \n\"This was the last straw,\" she said of Trump's policies. \"We're all immigrants.\" \n \nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n \nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey. \n \nTM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Creative Commons 2.0 by Yasmina Haryono / cropped  \nAnother early morning arrives for Lewis Gill and his team, and under the cover of darkness they prepare tray after tray of Snickers bars. \n \nBut rather than layering nougat with caramel and thick coatings of chocolate, Lewis' popular cakes are made with blended nuts and dried fruits - and just so happen to be gluten free. \n \nIt wasn't the 28-year-old's intention to create a line of aesthetically pleasing and naturally sweetened gluten free cakes, but it was just how the recipe worked. As his small Stockbridge stall grew in popularity, he opened Grams in Edinburgh last year to cater to a growing number of diets from dairy free to vegetarian and vegan. \n \nBut gluten was one aspect of the cafe that Lewis consciously added to the menu. While 80% of the dishes are gluten-free, he still wanted to offer the usual breads and wraps to customers without an intolerance or the autoimmune disease coeliac disease, which affects one in 100 people in Scotland. \n  \n\n  Lewis' raw cakes are accidentally gluten free  Grams  \nAcutely conscious of cross contamination, a dedicated space in the cafe's kitchen was set up for the preparation of the bread and wraps for his sandwiches, but Lewis says the majority of customers asking for gluten free products aren't doing so out of necessity, but for lifestyle reasons. \n \n\"I think about 99% of them are self diagnosed, a lot of people come in and they'll ask 'is that gluten free?' and we'll say no, and they'll say oh that's fine [and have it anyway],\" he says. \n \n\"It must be really annoying when [coeliacs] hear people asking for gluten free options when they're clearly not making a big fuss about it.\" \n \nThe 28-year-old says he instantly recognises a customer with coeliac disease or a gluten intolerance as they will ask a number of questions about how Grams prepares its food before ordering anything. \n \nCoeliac UK estimates that there are around 52,000 people in Scotland living with coeliac disease, but that the majority fall under the radar or are misdiagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. It's current campaign, Is It Coeliac Disease? aims to help those who may be living with the disease unknowingly. \n \nAn autoimmune disease, coeliacs are affected by a reaction of the immune system to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. When foods containing gluten are consumed, the immune system reacts by damaging the lining of the small intestine. \n https://twitter.com/Coeliac_UK/status/823171113102544896 | twitter  \nIt is a painful disease and is often accompanied by other symptoms such as bloating, diarrhoea, fatigue and in some cases weight loss. The only way to treat the disease is to strictly adhere to a gluten free diet. \n \nSince the discovery of the disease and it's advised treatment in the 1950s, coeliacs have been forced to check every label, ask a number of questions while eating out and to keep a close eye on what they are consuming. \n \nCross contamination is the biggest issue they can face, a single crumb of bread could cause stomach problems or a dish of ketchup that has made contact with breaded chicken posing a risk. \n \nThese issues are not faced by those who chose the strict diet without the necessary health demands, and Lewis believes many people can be scared of gluten unnecessarily without knowing why or doing enough research. \n \nLewis explains: \"The thing about gluten is that it can make you feel a bit bloated at times if you're eating loads of bread and [non-coeliacs] just freak out and think that is the gluten so they try and avoid it. \n \n\"They could probably still eat bread and not eat so much of it.\" \n \nWhile coeliacs have no choice but to eat a gluten free diet in order to stay healthy, there are some people who have a gluten intolerance or sensitivity to wheat and are advised by doctors to remove it from their diet. \n \nThere can also be confusion over the idea that leading a gluten free lifestyle is healthier, despite many gluten free replacement products containing high amounts of sugar to compensate for the lack of gluten which binds a typical bread or cake together. \n  \n\n  Grams is one of many cafes offering gluten free alternatives.  Grams  \nWhile the so-called 'trend' for removing gluten from a diet without medical advice can be a source of frustration for coeliacs, it has also driven a massive overhaul of the gluten free product industry. \n \nWhere once coeliacs could only eat expensive bread through prescription, most supermarkets now carry large sections offering everything from high quality gluten free pasta to cakes, breads and crackers. \n \nMyles Fitt, Scotland lead at Coeliac UK says: \"There are many others who do not have the condition but who also choose to follow a gluten-free diet and this has a significant impact on increasing the size of the gluten free market. \n \n\"According to Mintel, the UK free from market is currently valued at £365 million and forecast to grow by 50% by 2019 and the gluten free market alone is worth an estimated £210 million. \n \n\"This is welcome and has led to greater choice, quality and supply of gluten free products and dishes for those with coeliac disease.\" \n \nAs the phenomenon of gluten free steadily rises in the public's conscious, restaurants have become far more in tune with their customers offering a variety of gluten free dishes on their menus. \n \nBut as awareness increases, regulations are tightened and in Scotland an amendment to the Food Safety Act 1990 was introduced last year to ensure products listed as gluten free are labelled properly. \n \nLocal authorities across Scotland are becoming more aware of the importance of gluten free areas and are starting to check sites for their policy over cross contamination. \n \nMyles says: \"The challenge is to make sure that those businesses who are meeting this market do not lose sight of the medical importance of a gluten free diet for people with coeliac disease. \n \n\"Coeliac UK works with retailers and caterers to ensure the gluten-free food they supply is safe to eat and has the confidence of customers with coeliac disease.\" \n https://www.instagram.com/p/BInHkI-D_B2/?taken-by=pizzaexpress | instagram  \nThe charity offers companies advice on how best to avoid cross contamination, with an audit scheme which allows accredited sites to publish the charity's trusted gluten free symbol on its menus, providing a sense of assurance for it's service users. \n \nChains such as Pizza Hut, Carluccio's and Pizza Express have all been accredited by the charity while Harrods have introduced a gluten free afternoon tea option for customers which has passed Coeliac UK's rigorous testing. \n \nBut as cross contamination continues to be a major issue with coeliacs and taking a chance on eating out in a situation where they have no control over how food is prepared, 100% gluten free restaurants and cafes have started to open and among the most trusted are those run by coeliacs themselves. \n \nAdam Conway, who was diagnosed with coeliac disease in 2014, launched his gluten free bistro GF in late January, the Edinburgh cafe born from his own frustrations at being unable to eat out without feeling anxious. \n \nHe says: \"Many of my favourite restaurants before being diagnosed turned out to have fantastic gluten free menus, however after tucking into several different dishes at different places, sometimes you feel ill effects and you are left going over everything you have consumed the last couple days trying to work out possible causes.\" \n \nIt's an issue many coeliacs face, and while an upset stomach could be caused by cross contamination or simply a stomach bug, the simple act of reassurance is something which has become a top priority when catering for coeliacs as the diet rises in prominence in the public psyche. \n \nAdam adds: \"Hopefully GF can become the place to go for those with coeliac disease or any other food allergens.\" \n https://twitter.com/Coeliac_UK/status/823459589098237952 | twitter  \nWhile GF has only just opened to the public, the reaction from coeliacs in Edinburgh has been very positive. Yet pursuing a 100% gluten free business isn't necessarily a success story waiting to happen. \n \nFiona Kozak, who runs Fifi's Cafe and Bistro in Aberdeen, recently reintroduced items containing gluten to the menu to appease her customers after going 100% gluten free in 2015. \n \nShe explains: \"From a business point of view, I had to look at the fact I'm a community cafe in a really strong community and I had to look at what people in that community really wanted. \n \n\"The majority weren't really necessarily wanting gluten free, they wanted normal bread. I gave it a year and I think my response was to the majority of my customer base.\" \n \nWhile Fiona isn't a coeliac, she and her husband follow a gluten free diet at home and says that while she changed the menu to entice a larger clientele, she also offers reassurance to her regulars that the gluten free element would still make up 90% of the menu and an importance would continue to be placed on minimising cross contamination. \n \nAs gluten remains a hot topic for the hospitality industry, Coeliac UK note that there have been positive steps for Scotland's coeliacs even if the charge isn't necessarily being led by those with the autoimmune condition. \n \nTo wander into a supermarket and pick up frozen gluten free pizzas, cake mixes and loaves of bread at increasingly reasonable prices like any other shopper has been great achievement for the community. \n \nAnd to be able to walk into a restaurant with friends and family with a quiet knowledge that it has achieved an accreditation or is 100% free from gluten, helps to bring a sense of normality to a coeliac's life as they tuck into a plate of pasta that looks the same as everyone else's. \n   Want to receive the latest headlines straight to your inbox?

City won 3-0. \n\nSam Allardyce\u2019s side struggled to gain a foothold in the opening exchanges, as City dominated possession and camped themselves in their opponents\u2019 half of the field. \n\nDavid Silva was, unsurprisingly, heavily involved in his team\u2019s best passing moves, but it was an attacking three of Sterling, Jesus and Leroy Sane that caught the eye most. The former tended to hug the touchline on the right, drawing Palace left-back Jeffrey Schlupp towards him and in turn opening up space in the channel, while the latter drifted infield to combine with Silva and Fabian Delph, who made a number of dangerous darts forward from midfield. \n\nJesus, meanwhile, generally stayed central but did not restrict his work to zones in and around the penalty area. The teenager often dropped deep to link the play and encourage runners beyond him, while Pep Guardiola would have been delighted to see him press from the front as City sought to deny Palace an easy way out. \n\nAfter plenty of promising moments throughout the opening half, Jesus\u2019 first decisive contribution came just a couple of minutes before the interval. He showed both strength and skill to shrug off Kelly, before his slide-rule pass made it easy for Sterling to break the deadlock. \n\nCity became a little sloppy after the restart, with Palace twice going close to an equaliser, but a fine counter-attacking goal in the 71st minute gave Guardiola\u2019s side some valuable breathing space. Sane timed his run brilliantly to sneak in behind Joel Ward as the visitors broke quickly when a Palace move collapsed, with the excellent Silva measuring a pinpoint pass to the German. \n\nIt was Sane\u2019s third strike in his last three outings, and while there has been justifiable criticism of City\u2019s recent transfer record when it comes to defenders and midfielders, the club\u2019s supporters will be incredibly excited by a talented\u2026","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Manchester City news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: EPL - Crystal Palace news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Led by Gabriel Jesus, Manchester City offer glimpse into the future with win over Crystal Palace","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"MyInforms","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552614979","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"MyInforms","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://myinforms.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/led-by-gabriel-jesus-manchester-city-offer-glimpse-into-the-future-with-win-over-crystal-palace"],"sequenceId":"695202004964","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:10:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://i1.myinforms.com/300x200/default.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\"Mr. President, look at us,\" said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \"This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American.\" \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \"We are all immigrants!\" and \"No ban! No wall!\" \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \"What's happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\" \n \nAirport arrests \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \"President Trump's new Muslim ban.\" \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n \n\"This executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\" he said in a statement. \n \nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \"Portland coffee comes from Yemen,\" one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n \nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \"hashtag activist\" but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n \n\"This was the last straw,\" she said of Trump's policies. \"We're all immigrants.\" \n \nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n \nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey. \n \nTM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

They had wanted to see it covered with a big A1 photo. \n \nA picture from the Women\u2019s March in Washington, D.C., received the lead play \u2014 a six-column wide, 6-plus-inch-deep shot. Below it appeared a two-column wide, 2-plus-inch-deep photo of a girl at the San Diego event. The caption teased to a story on the San Diego march on A3 written by three U-T staffers. The story was accompanied by two photos \u2014 a six-column-wide shot and one three columns wide. \n \nThe coverage was insufficient for reader Jean Walcher of South Park. \n \n\u201cI just wanted to voice my great disappointment at the ... coverage of Saturday\u2019s Women\u2019s March in Sunday\u2019s paper,\u201d Walcher wrote. \u201cTo be among 40,000 fellow San Diegans marching through downtown San Diego was beyond inspiring. Many of us would have been so excited to have looked at Sunday\u2019s paper and been greeted with a big front-page photo of our hometown march. Instead, the cover photo was of the D.C. march, and we were relegated to A3. \n \n\u201cI know the paper had photographers there, so can\u2019t understand this thinking of not featuring our hometown march. Would have resonated so much more for your readers.\u201d \n \nThe event was a rare occurrence \u2014 tens of thousands of people marching in San Diego eclipsed by an even more enormous related demonstration in the nation\u2019s capital. \n \n\u201cWe too thought depicting San Diego\u2019s march on page 1 was important, which we did with the photo of the young girl and a reference to our comprehensive local story on A3,\u201d said U-T Design Director Michael Price, who designed that day\u2019s A1. \u201cBut the home base, if you will, of the protest was D.C. Washington was its heart, all other protests across the country and the world sprung from the plan to march on Washington. \n \n\u201cThe photo we chose to run largest on A1 and its accompanying national story, I believe captured the sweep and gravity of the event in terms of reporting and visuals, and provided the context necessary to support what was nearly five pages of related coverage.\u201d \n Massive protest and a profanity  \nReader Paul Tessaro of Mission Hills caught something in last Sunday\u2019s front page photo of the Women\u2019s March with aid of his iPad, which he used to enlarge the picture. \n \nIn the lower right, a sign can be seen that displays the vulgar word President Donald Trump used in the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording in 2005. Although small, the word can be read without the photo being enlarged. \n \nPhoto editors routinely scan protest-type shots when they edit photos to guard against profanity being published. \n \n\u201cIf we don\u2019t run those words in stories, we don\u2019t run them in photos,\u201d said David Poller, one of the U-T\u2019s photo editors.Despite photo editors\u2019 best efforts, a word or image can slip by, especially when the photo is like the one of the Women\u2019s March, in which a sea of handmade signs appeared. \n San Diego County\u2019s Mount Laguna  \nA story on A1 Jan. 20 about the weather reported on how much snow was expected to fall on \u201cthe peak of Mount Laguna.\u201d A story about the weather Jan. 21 also referred to \u201cthe top of Mount Laguna.\u201d Can you spot the error? \n \nGary Mortenson, a former U-T copy editor, did and called in. Mount Laguna is an unincorporated community in the Laguna Mountains. It is not a mountain peak. \n \nadrian.vore@sduniontribune.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Adrian Vore"},"topics":[{"name":"San Diego news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Washington DC news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Why D.C.

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\"Mr. President, look at us,\" said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \"This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American.\" \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \"We are all immigrants!\" and \"No ban! No wall!\" \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \"What's happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\" \n \nAirport arrests \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \"President Trump's new Muslim ban.\" \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n \n\"This executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\" he said in a statement. \n \nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \"Portland coffee comes from Yemen,\" one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n \nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \"hashtag activist\" but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n \n\"This was the last straw,\" she said of Trump's policies. \"We're all immigrants.\" \n \nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n \nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey. \n \nTM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left.

When asked about how the New England Patriots might stop Jones in Super Bowl LI, Talib said that it would have to be a two-man job. \n\n\"You better double him. You better have somebody helping you,\" Talib said. \"I don't think anyone can guard him one-on-one and have a day with him. \n\n\"He should have a safety on top of him and corner pressing him, that's the best you can do to try to stop him. \n\nNeil asked Talib about what made Jones such a hard player to stop. \n\n\"It's everything, man, he's the total package. He's got the size, the strength, the speed, the confidence and the ball skills. That's the ultimate receiver, right there.\" \n\nWATCH: Best of the Skills Showdown! \n\nAll the action from 2017's Pro Bowl challenges. \n\n2017 will be the first time that the Falcons have made the Super Bowl since 1998. Talib reflected on the moment he won Super Bowl 50 with the Broncos. \n\n\"Winning that game is the ultimate feeling that an NFL player can get. We were on the field for an hour, before we started the media stuff. It was an absolute joy to win.\" \n\nTalib also talked about Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, who he believes will go to the next level with a Super Bowl win. \n\n\"Matt Ryan is one of the best quarterbacks in the middle of his career right now. If he can come out with a Super Bowl, he's going to go to the next level, and be right behind those elite guys. \n\n\"It's a huge day for 'Matty Ice' and his legacy, and I think he can get it done.\" \n\nSky Sports is your home of NFL.

In a most profound way, I began to discover who God was calling me to be.\u201d \n \nSince that first visit, the family has grown to include some 50 full-time staff members and more than 75 seasonal staff \u2014 some of whom first went to McDowell on camping trips when they were young \u2014 and the land has expanded from its original 160 acres to 1,140 acres of fields, forests, trails, canyons, waterfalls, and residential facilities with 770 beds. \n \nFounded in 1947 by the Episcopal Diocese of Alabama, the Camp has become a mecca of varied programs for visitors of all ages \u2014 two summer camp areas, a large conference center, the largest residential environmental center in the southeast, the first residential farm school in the Southeast, and the Alabama Folk School, to name just a few. Along the way it\u2019s become the Episcopal camp and conference center with the largest capacity in the U.S. \n \nWhen Johnston was in school at the University of the South, Sewanee, he returned to work at the Camp each summer at a time when The Rev. Scott Eppes was camp director. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get enough of the place,\u201d he says of those summers. \u201cThere was a farm, and I did maintenance work, a lot of work with cows, picked green beans and corn and dug potatoes and hauled pulpwood. All kinds of stuff, and it was really good for me. Working those summers continued to help me figure out who God was calling me to be.\u201d \n \nAfter Sewanee he worked with programs for inner city children, and then decided to go to seminary at the university\u2019s St. Luke\u2019s School of Theology where he graduated with a Master\u2019s in 1980. For several years he served at small churches along Alabama\u2019s Black Belt and did youth work for the Episcopal Diocese and the National Episcopal Church, before becoming director of Camp McDowell. \n \nLearning in nature \n \nOne of the most recent children\u2019s programs the Camp has added is the state\u2019s first Nature School for preschoolers, The Magnolia Nature Preschool for area residents. It\u2019s an educational concept that has been popular in Europe and other parts of the United States for many years. The Magnolia Preschool recently entered into a partnership with Head Start so that more children can afford to attend. \u201cA lot of us grew up playing in creeks and being outside all the time,\u201d Johnston says, \u201cbut most kids don\u2019t do that any more. \n \n\u201cAt the Nature School they spend almost all day outside, go to the farm, and play in the forest and the creeks. A lot of its lessons are about problem-solving, cooperation, those kinds of things. Kids have lost connection with where their food comes from, so we\u2019re teaching them about the science of farming and about nutrition. They\u2019re also building relationships with each other, bonding with their teacher, and getting to know laying hens and goats and broccoli and carrots. They\u2019ll graduate from the school \u2018kindergarten ready.\u2019\u201d \n \nAnother popular activity is the Alabama Folk School, which just marked its 10th year. Its goal is to preserve old-time traditions of the state\u2019s arts, crafts, and music. Workshops have ranged from the famous Gee\u2019s Bend quilters to guitar, fiddle, drawing, cooking, writing, blacksmithing, dulcimer, and harmony singing, including Sacred Harp. \n \n\u201cPeople have gotten out of touch with their art and heritage,\u201d Johnston says, \u201cso a lot of what the Folk School does is to build community and help people get back in touch with the art of creation and the Creator.\u201d \n \nAnother program is called Bethany\u2019s Kids; it brings together handicapped and typical kids at a new, fully accessible summer-camp style complex. A new grant from the Appalachian Regional Commission will allow McDowell to partner with Winston County Schools. \u201cThe kids will be coming here for farm-ed,\u201d Johnston says, \u201cand we\u2019ll be going to the schools and teaching student-centered, inquiry-based education. It\u2019s the new science standard for teachers. Our teachers at the McDowell Environmental Center and Farm School have been using that means of instruction in our programming since we started. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve really bonded with the teachers and the administration, and the main question is \u2018Why didn\u2019t this happen a long time ago?\u2019 It\u2019ll be great for people to get acquainted with us, instead of saying \u2018I wonder what\u2019s down there at the end of that road?\u2019\u201d \n \nNew opportunities and initiatives seem to come about almost daily at the Camp. Solar panels are gradually being added, with the aim of reducing the facility\u2019s carbon footprint. A recycling center for the camp is almost completed with a goal of the camp becoming zero landfill. \n \nBut throughout the changes, Camp McDowell\u2019s goal has stayed constant, Johnston says. \u201cWe have a wonderful community here that welcomes all people with love and joy. I believe in the future we will keep the creativity and the passion and the ability for the Camp to continue to be a place where dreams are fulfilled and a place where people learn who God is calling them to be. We want to make the world a better place. We want to show how the world could be.\u201d \n \nDale Short\u2019s email is dale.short@gmail.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Nauvoo facility reintroduces residents to nature, tradition","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Walker","zipCode":"35501","state":"Alabama","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jasper","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Mountain Eagle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169763340","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"13"},"name":"Daily Mountain Eagle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mountaineagle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202046173","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:10:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

California voters approved Proposition 64 in November, which legalizes the recreational use of marijuana. The state has until Jan. 1, 2018, to begin issuing licenses for adult-use pot shops. \n Associated Press   \nFor example, numerous offenses that were previously felonies now are misdemeanors or simple infractions and some offenses, such as possession of an ounce or less of marijuana by an adult 21 or older, are no longer illegal. Possession of an ounce or less by individuals younger than 21 still is illegal and continues to be a $100 infraction. \n   \n\"Basically, some conduct that was criminal before isn't criminal now,\" said San Luis Obispo County Assistant District Attorney Lee Cunningham. \"There are circumstances where (charges) could be a misdemeanor or a felony. It will definitely change the way law enforcement handles (marijuana-related calls).\" \n   \nOn average, 14,000 people a year are arrested in California for marijuana offenses \u2014 a half million individuals were arrested in the last decade \u2014 but with Prop. 64 now on the books, thousands of people no longer will be going to jail for smoking pot, Lyman said.  \n   \nFor example, in all cases, juvenile offenders under 18 won't be subject to criminal punishment (incarceration) but to drug education and community service, which Lyman said is a victory for marijuana reform and criminal justice. \n   \n\"The No. 1 way kids get into the criminal justice system is through marijuana offenses,\" Lyman said. \"Now children can't be arrested or go to jail. That pipeline is closed altogether. Arrest is off the table.\" \n   \nSanta Barbara County Chief Probation Officer Lupe Rabago said the most serious charge among juveniles has shifted over time with a decline in property offenses to an increase in narcotic/drug offenses. \n   \nAdditionally, teens who committed marijuana-related crimes prior to the passage of Prop. 64 and turned 18 after Nov. 8 now can apply to have their records sealed. That means the federal government can't turn down those individuals for student loans based on past criminal convictions, Lyman said. \n   \nAlso, people serving time in jails and prison for marijuana-related offenses can petition the courts for early release or reduced sentences, if the criminal justice changes apply to them. \n   \n\"It's all retroactive,\" Lyman said. \"The criminal justice pieces (of Prop. 64) were huge.\" \n  +2    \nIn this Sept. 16, 2015 file photo, customers shop for marijuana inside a recreational marijuana store, in Denver, Colorado. California voters legalized marijuana for recreational use in November, and the state has to sort through how to implement the new regulations. \n Associated Press   \n Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox  \n   \nBut if pot smokers, or the public in general, were expecting to see sweeping changes in how the state deals with recreational marijuana soon after Nov. 8, they likely will have months to wait, if not the remainder of the year. \n   \n\"I don't know anybody who has noticed any difference since Prop. 64 has passed,\" said Dale Gieringer, CalNORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) director. \"There has been no impact on day-to-day activity. The big change will come with the cannabis clubs and lounges.\" \n   \nPresently, there are no adult-use pot shops in California. Only registered medical marijuana patients can walk into a dispensary and buy cannabis. However, under Prop. 64, it's not only legal for adults over 21 to possess marijuana, they can also share their pot without fear of arrest. Public consumption, however, still is illegal.  \n   \n\"I could share with you and it would be completely legal,\" Lyman said, adding law enforcement could attempt to arrest an individual for sharing their cannabis but that the officer would \"be wrong in the eyes of the law.\" \n   \nBoth Gieringer and Lyman don't believe the state will begin issuing licenses to establish pot shops any time soon. The state has to sort through how to implement Prop. 64 first, but the deadline for Sacramento to start issuing licenses to those planned cannabis clubs and pot shops is Jan. 1, 2018. \n   \nCities and counties have the ability to put different rules in place.  \n   \n\"Prop. 64 laid out the rules, but it didn't implement them,\" Gieringer said. \"There are two parallel licensing systems with slightly different rules. It's going to be whenever local governments start allowing on-site consumption.\" \n   \nApril Charlton   covers Santa Barbara County for Lee Central Coast Newspapers.

The officials included Vice President Mike Pence, chief of staff Reince Priebus, senior strategist Steve Bannon and counselor Kellyanne Conway. \"So you have one last chance to get out.\" \n \nTrump said he talked about the ban a lot during the campaign and \"we're now putting it into effect.\" \n \nIn a pair of separate actions, Trump took steps to begin restructuring the White House National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council. He also gave Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the president's top military advisers, 30 days to come up with a plan defeat the Islamic State group. Scores of people have been killed in terrorist acts that IS has carried out overseas or has inspired on U.S. soil. \n \nUnder an executive order that Trump signed in the presence of the news media, every political appointee joining the executive branch on or after Jan. 20 \u2014 the day Trump took office \u2014 must agree to the lobbying bans. That includes avoiding, for five years after leaving, lobbying the agency they worked for. \n \nAnother provision sets a two-year period during which appointees must avoid working on issues involving former employers or clients. \n \nTrump is allowed to waive any of the restrictions. \n \nQuestions had been raised about how the bans would be enforced. The order says they are \"solely enforceable\" by the U.S. government \"by any legally available means,\" including debarment proceeding within any affected executive branch agency, or civil court proceedings. \n \nFormer appointees who are found to have violated the ban may also be barred from lobbying their former agency for up to five years, on top of the five-year period covered by the pledge, the executive order states. \n \nTrump said the order supersedes one that President Barack Obama signed on Jan. 21, 2009, that banned anyone from lobbying the government for a period of two years after leaving. Trump said Obama's order was \"full of loopholes.\" \n \nThe president signed the order and a pair of presidential memoranda near the end of an intense day of telephone diplomacy during which he discussed a range of issues with the leaders of Japan, Germany, Russia, France and Australia. All are leaders Trump needs to build relationships with. \n \nTrump had released the plan for a lobbying ban a few weeks before the November election, one of several promised policies aimed at curbing corruption and the influence of lobbyists in Washington. Trump also made promises about transparency and ethics. \n \nSome have argued that the ban could make it difficult for Trump to fill thousands of jobs throughout the administration by causing some candidates to become squeamish about limiting their ability to make money after they leave government employment. \n \nOthers say the prohibitions on lobbying are too insignificant to be effective.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"DARLENE SUPERVILLE"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump sets tougher restrictions on lobbying by officials","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Anoka","zipCode":"55432","state":"Minnesota","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Minneapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Minneapolis Star Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663279","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"11345"},"name":"Minneapolis Star Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.startribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202047300","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:10:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Only later did a White House official, responding to a question, acknowledge that sanctions were not among the topics the two leaders discussed. \n \nIn the first week of his presidency, Trump has been noncommittal on lifting sanctions imposed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, in response to U.S. findings of interference by Russia in the election. Sanctions by the U.S. and its allies were in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and other actions in the Baltic region. \n \nBoth descriptions of the call focused on the positive aspects of a new American leader engaging with the Russian president. In a brief statement, the White House said the discussion was \"a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair.\" \n \nThe two leaders discussed \"a range in topics from mutual cooperation in defeating ISIS to efforts in working together to achieve more peace throughout the world including Syria,\" the White House statement said, using an acronym for the militant group. \n \nThe White House official who spoke after the statement was issued said Putin brought up several times that Islamic terrorism was a \"common foe\" for the U.S. and Russia. The official was not authorized to disclose details of the call by name and insisted on anonymity. \n \nAddressing topics not mentioned in the White House statement, the Kremlin said that the two leaders discussed the importance of \"restoring mutually beneficial trade and economic ties between business circles of the two countries.\" \n \nThe Kremlin also said that Putin and Trump spoke in particular about international issues, including the fight against terrorism, the Arab-Israeli conflict, Iran's nuclear program, the situation on the Korean peninsula and the Ukraine crisis. \n \nMoscow has applauded Trump's promises to rebuild U.S.-Russian relations, which have been pushed to their worst level since the Cold War by the Ukraine crisis, war in Syria and allegations of Russian meddling in U.S. elections. \n \nTrump signed a presidential memorandum on the plan to defeat the Islamic State group Saturday, including in it the possibility of teaming up with \"new coalition partners,\" suggesting that pairing up with Russia on counterterrorism issues wasn't off the table. \n \nWhen asked by reporters about sanctions on Friday, Trump responded: \"We'll see what happens. As far as the sanctions, very early to be talking about that.\" \n \nIn 2014, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region and backed separatists fighting government forces in eastern Ukraine, drawing widespread condemnation in Europe and the United States. In response, sanctions were implemented against sectors of Russia's economy, including financial services, energy, mining and defense. The Obama administration also sanctioned people in Putin's inner circle. \n \nShortly before leaving office, Obama also ordered sanctions on Russian spy agencies, closed two Russian compounds in the United States and expelled 35 diplomats that he said were really spies. These sanctions followed an assessment by U.S. intelligence that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump. \n \nTrump's tempered approach to U.S.-Russia relations has already raised concern among several European allies who believe keeping Russia in check is essential to regional security. Domestically, some Republican lawmakers have warned against easing sanctions and pledged to put them into law. \n \nTrump also placed calls Saturday to French President Francois Hollande, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JULIE PACE and VIVIAN SALAMA"},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Officials say Trump, Putin avoided topic of sanctions","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Anoka","zipCode":"55432","state":"Minnesota","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Minneapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Minneapolis Star Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663279","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"11345"},"name":"Minneapolis Star Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.startribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202047785","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:10:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president.\n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year.\n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar.\n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar.\n\nHow does this happen?\n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market.\n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds.\n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period.\n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent.\n\nBonds are for fear\n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel.\n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again.\n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half.\n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER\n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n \nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n \nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n \nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n \nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n \n___ \n \n11:50 p.m. \n \nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n \nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n \nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n \n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n \n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n \nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n \nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n \nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n \n___ \n \n8:30 p.m. \n \nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n \nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n \nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n \nSo why is he giving up racing? \n \n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n \n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n \nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n \nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n \n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n \n___ \n \n8:15 p.m. \n \nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n \nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n \nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n \n___ \n \n7:15 p.m. \n \nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n \nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n \nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n \n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n \nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n \n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n \nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n \n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n \n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n \n__ \n \n6:15 p.m. \n \nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n \nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n \n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n \nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n \n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n \nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n \n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n \n___ \n \n5:45 p.m. \n \nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n \nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n \nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n \n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n \nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n \n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n \n___ \n \n4:20 p.m. \n \nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n \nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n \nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n \nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year. \n \nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car. He turned it over to Seb Morris in third as the Cadillac teams had put all but one car in the prototype class at least a lap down. \n \n___ \n \n2:30 p.m. \n \nThe 55th running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona is underway, with pole-sitter Joao Barbosa leading the 55-car field to the green flag. \n \nThe twice-around-the-clock endurance race began under cool temperatures and cloudy skies, with a threat of steady rain predicted for later Saturday. \n \nFour-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon started the race in the pits, with Wayne Taylor Racing teammate Ricky Taylor opening behind the wheel of the No. 10 Cadillac. \n \n\"Dancing with the Stars\" runner-up and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe, four-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay also are in the field. \n \nChip Ganassi Racing, which has dominated the Rolex in recent years, has two entries. One of them includes Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais, who won their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer non-durables news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Luxury goods news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Switzerland news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NASCAR news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The Latest: Jeff Gordon, Taylor Racing halfway home to Rolex","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Anoka","zipCode":"55432","state":"Minnesota","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Minneapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Minneapolis Star Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663279","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"11345"},"name":"Minneapolis Star Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["MotorRacing","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.startribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202049988","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:10:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

To free ourselves from boundaries and self caging. is to grow our strength in character, trustworthiness, and responsibilities. \n   \nNew Orleans (PRWEB)  January 29, 2017 \n \nGrand Master Shi DeRu, a worldwide Zen traveler, lifetime Zen student and mentor will give a speech on High Conscious Health and Happiness and will conduct a short Zen workshop/seminar at Chinese New Year Annual Celebration on Shaolin Institute New Orleans campus, Feb 4th 2007, starting 11:00 AM. This seminar is a part of his 2017 worldwide Living Zen and TaiGong teaching tour series in quantum leap in high conscious health, promoting the path of grit with basic living principles of life. \n \nChinese New Year of Golden Rooster is here to stay until the dog year shows up on Feb 16th 2018. To connect the conscious nature with conscious beings in oneness, and connect yesteryear with this New Year, DeRu has been paving the way in both US and China for greater health and higher consciousness worldwide. \n \nTo do that, his worldwide Living Zen High Conscious Health teaching tour first Asian series in meditation and TaiGong training 2017 has been launched since December 24th in Shanghai China. That Living Zen is transmitting in quantum leap in global conscious communication on the path of grit with life principles in character and integrity. \n \nHe continued that Living Zen with quantum health teachings through many cities in Anhui, China and all the way to China's capital Beijing.

In this set of teaching series, he places the focus on \u201cLet it go so one can rise up with high consciousness.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt is time to let go of over-thinking and problem searching，\u201d said DeRu, \u201cTo free ourselves from boundaries and self caging is to grow our strength in character, trustworthiness, and responsibilities. That is to be truly free.\u201d as he stressed his statement. \n \n\u201cHappiness with a health body and a health mind is almost what everyone wishes to possess,\u201d as the Zen master clarified, \u201cHigh conscious intelligence, from Healing to Health with Harmony and Happiness penetrates and permeates into all the communities of Zen world, further prevailing into all conscious beings around the globe.\u201d \n \nAccording to DeRu, Zen sees one conscious world, and one conscious being with one breath and one source of origin, from nothing to everything, expanding to apparent visible world as one sees with naked eye. However; the invisible potentiality is unlimited and infinite. The high conscious intelligence continues its path to infinite potentiality to everlasting-limitless universe. \n \nDeRu further explained: \"Zen sees the reality of potentiality is in the emptiness within and between the visible worlds. It is that emptiness of potentiality makes the universe going with consistent and constant expanding in infinity.\" \n \nThis is how the Zen Master sees the world, \"The high conscious mind of the universe guides and decides the direction of the universe expansion and development. When one follows the heart of the high conscious universe, one believes and achieves one\u2019s dream with unwavering faith and confidence. One will eventually be intotal communication and merge with that of infinite oneness.\" \n \n\u201cIt is that Zen mind propagates and instigates Imagination which opens the 3rd eye to vision the infinite Potentiality of the true reality of the universe.\" according to DeRu. \u201cWe are all part of, and microcosm of the universe. Our body particles are universal participles and our atoms are part of the universe atoms. Our conscious Qi waves are closely connected with the Qi waves of the universe consciousness which set the parameter to guide each step of our path if we wish to discover within the happiness and health.\u201d \n \nZen philosophy along with Zen way of living has been in lead in high conscious living beings for thousands of years. Zen Master DeRu sees Quantum theory along with scientific experiment of quantum physics gives lights, like taking many pictorial shots of reality of the world, to ordinary conscious beings, believers and non believers alike to observe and see the truth of the world, and the conscious universe in communication and expansion with unlimited potentiality without time or space limitations. \n \nDeRu firmly believes, \"In that Zen world one begins to see, In lieu of the fittest and fiercest fight for victory and survival with competitiveness from the selected few, humanity leading all conscious beings together claim victory by synergy and cooperation with compassion and love.\u201d \n \nDeRu maintains, \"war and fierce competition is for ignorant self-serving few, leading to self-destruction, it is, he said, the synergy in peace with harmony in cooperation leading all beings to greater development in advancement of conscious beings.\" \n \n\"Leaving Newton as a hero of the past,\" he insists, \"we must move on, following vision of the Ancient Chan in all conscious, subconscious and superconscious communication, human beings shall explore further. seeing beyond and through that visible illusionary world into that true universe intelligence and wisdom, and see the true potential world beyond time and space with the guidance of Albert Einstein, Max Planck and Niels Bohr\u2019s scientific minds.\" \n \nMaster Shi DeRu a 31 generation Shaolin Chan (Zen) Master has been teaching Living Zen Mind and Zen meditation with TaGong for over three decades worldwide, especially in China and the US. \n \nHe has been hosting his Annual Qi Retreat in the US for the last two decades with various theme topics on health and happy living.
