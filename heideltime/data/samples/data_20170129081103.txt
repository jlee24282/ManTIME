A panel of top foreign policy honchos, which included former national security advisor Shivshankar Menon, was true to form at the Jaipur Literature Festival last week as they agreed that the disruption caused by the 45th US President is \u201cgood for India\u201d because it creates spaces for middling powers like Delhi to manoeuvre foreign policy in the national interest. And if that sounded cold-blooded and transactional, said Carnegie India director C Rajamohan, then that was a good thing as India has to be \u201ceven more, more and more transactional\u201d if that suited her. Perhaps it has always been like this in key centres of power worldwide. At the height of the non-aligned movement (NAM), led by the troika of India, Egypt and Yugoslavia, several NAM members were unafraid of striking deals at the cost of other NAM relationships. Also Read: In one week, Trump shakes up Washington and the world So should the pursuit of foreign affairs subject itself to the high moral ground? The Jaipur Litfest panel cited above would certainly say no. But for a unique civilization like India, which marshalled a freedom movement to redeem itself, it cannot be that its foreign policy is so divorced from national values and so devoted to vaulting ambition that it shuts its eyes to all that is wilfully abominable. Hint of Desperation When Trump called Modi earlier this week to say hello, media outlets gushed that he was only the fifth head of government the US president had spoken to. \u201cEven before Putin,\u201d some media outlets crowed. Modi is likely to make that trip to America sooner than later, so as to quickly establish a relationship with the most powerful man in the world. As India\u2019s relations with China deteriorate, the PM will increasingly see Trump as a hedge against the other Asian power \u2014 especially as Trump has openly stated his intention to curb Xi Jinping\u2019s dream of becoming Numero Uno. The realpolitik school is already applauding. And what of Trump\u2019s open hostility to Muslims and Muslim immigrants? For a country with the world\u2019s second largest Muslim population, that is a course to worry about. Then there is Trump\u2019s determination to build a wall so as to prevent Mexicans from neighbouring Mexico enter his country. Or the decision to ban abortion and roll back decades of the women\u2019s liberation movement \u2014 not to speak of his abhorrent \u201clocker-room talk\u201d on the campaign trail. It boggles the mind, but I\u2019m almost sure Indira Gandhi wouldn\u2019t have fallen forward so determinedly. Perhaps that assumption is also being made because Mrs Gandhi was also a woman \u2014 although in that department of high female standards which includes a sense of distinctive right and wrong, the British PM Theresa May seems terribly lacking as she rushed to meet Trump this weekend. Come to think of it, how many women does Modi have in his senior echelons who could strike a dissenting note and offer restraining advice? Sushma Swaraj, the best of them all, was marginalised even before she fell ill. Everyone knows Vasundhara Raje and Modi hardly see eye-to-eye. The Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu said that for any leader to be successful, he should know his enemy. Deng Xiaoping took a leaf out of that book to formulate his \u201cTwenty-Four Character\u201d strategy which enjoined his fellow-men and women to \u201cobserve the situation calmly\u201d and refuse to react. Modi should read Deng\u2019s book and follow his advice. In the turbulence that follows Trump\u2019s ascension to power, so much better to stay cool and refuse to be flattered. A multi-polar world suits India\u2019s interests far better than hanging on to the coat-tails of just one power, especially one which refuses to respect large parts of his population. India\u2019s foreign policy has to be rooted in domestic values and must emerge from it.

Saturday's meeting addressed crime and violence in the 61605 area, and how police and the community can work together to restore their trust in each other.\n\nAbout 30 people were present and involved in the two-hour afternoon discussion held at Carver Community Center.\n\nPeoria Police Chief Jerry Mitchell spoke about the Residential Officer Program and said results already are having a positive impact in certain areas of town. An officer moves to a neighborhood where there is a high rate of crime with the purpose of \"bringing that community back.\"\n\n\"If you have an officer in your neighborhood, in your block, it has a tendency to quiet down,\" Mitchell said.\n\nAccording to Mitchell, Peoria police had noticed in the past a 19.8 percent crime reduction in a period of three years since an officer has moved in to an area of high crime. Mitchell said the city could use 10 of its officers in the residential program \u2014 at the moment there are four \u2014 but because of budget restraints it may take several years to actually put the plan into action.\n\nMitchell said community residents need to join the conversation and point out what their priorities are when the City Council gets into budget talks.\n\n\"Crime can remain the same, but community relations can improve,\" Mitchell said.\n\nRita Ali, chairwoman for the Advisory Committee on Police Community Relations, addressed residents' concerns about figuring out the root causes of crime in town.\n\n\"One major problem we identified was being the lack of trust between police and the community,\" Ali said. \"Another was perception, and related to the perception of the south side and the East Bluff in terms of the reputation of those sides of town in Peoria, and possible oversurveillance of police in those areas, so you're likely to be ticketed more in some of those higher crime places.\"\n\nErnestine Jackson, a member of the Peoria Public Schools Board of Education, said people need to understand the importance of speaking up when they see something wrong.\n\n\"We cannot sit back, as a community, knowing certain things are happening near your garage and not saying anything and then getting sad because someone is dead, or somebody's been shot,\" Jackson said.\n\nMitchell and Ali agreed there is a need to address the whole community to be able to make those changes, and that goes beyond law enforcement's job.\n\n\"I can't educate your children, I am not a teacher,\" Mitchell said. \"I can't create jobs, I can't create those opportunities. All we can do is foster that relationship to say that we're not out here to cause you any issue, we're here to give you direction. This is community-based.\"\n\n\"I've been tired of it,\" he said of violence in the city. \"There is nobody here that goes to bed with bad news and wakes up with more bad news than me, but it needs to come from the community, or we will not succeed. There has to be opportunity, education, awareness, jobs. Otherwise, we\u2019re going to be talking about this for several years.\"\n\nAli suggested that another meeting for the 61605 ZIP code was needed. It was tentatively set for Feb. 25, although the date and location are yet to be confirmed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Elisa  Marques"},"topics":[],"title":"Peorians share ideas at Town Hall meeting in effort to curb violence","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Peoria","zipCode":"61643","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Peoria","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"PJStar.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668761","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1892"},"name":"PJStar.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pjstar.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203683899","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

TANNER -- Helped Kick Off The Night By Introducing New Kids On The Block  \nIn case you didn\u2019t know, Candace is a huge NKOTB fan, and has been over the last 30 years. The band and Bure united on her show Fuller House , so there was no one better to introduce the band and kick off the show than D.J. Tanner herself. \n   New Kids On The Block Brought All The Right Stuff  \nNew Kids On The Block are one of the O.G. boybands, and after over 30 years of performing together, the guys still have  the right stuff . NKOTB took the stage to perform hits like \u201cStep By Step,\u201d \u201cYou Got It (The Right Stuff),\u201d and more, and brought all of their amazing dance moves with them. And yes, we\u2019re talking about those classic steps you learned from watching their music videos. \n Also, the NKOTB fans were out in FULL FORCE.

From there the Blues plummeted to 6-126 before being knocked over in the 31st over, the 26 extras Quirindi bowled a welcome contribution.\n\n\u201cToby and Lachie batted well, but it would have been nice to see one of them go on,\u201d Paterson said.\n\nParsons, the former Newcastle Knights prop, claimed two wickets in his final over to finish with 6-40 while partner in crime Cohen returned 3-31.\n\nTamworth then turned it on with the ball.\n\n\u201cOur bowling was exceptional,\u201d Paterson said.\n\n\u201cThey really kept it tight.\u201d\n\nOpeners Lachlan Davidson and Brad Redshaw embodied that.\n\nRedshaw didn\u2019t concede a run from his first four overs and went for just 13 off his eight, whilst picking up two wickets.\n\nThe signs were ominous for Quirindi when Davidson (2-18) struck the second ball of the innings to leave them 1-0.\n\nThat became 2-6 when Redshaw bowled Mick Burgess. Heeding his side\u2019s call to arms, skipper Elliot Tourle found a willing ally in Tom Tanner, the two steering Quirindi to 50 before Davidson removed Tanner.\n\nTourle continued to hold the innings together but when he departed for 52, Quirindi\u2019s hopes effectively departed with him as the Paterson brothers Jye (3-18) and Luke (2-27) finished off what Redshaw and Davidson started.\n\nGunnedah meanwhile cruised to a comfortable six-wicket win against Glen Innes at Gunnedah.\n\nGlen Innes could only manage 105 after winning the toss. Vinnie Winsor was the pick of the home side's bowlers, claiming 4-19 in 10 accurate overs.\n\nFresh from a four-wicket haul on Saturday in the McAdam Cup, Kaleb McIlveen's golden arm again left an indelible impact.\n\nMcIlveen proved a wonderful foil for Winsor, collecting figures of 3-21.\n\nGunnedah had few problems in the chase against a charitable Glen attack.\n\nGlen Innes conceded 36 extras, highlighted by a stunning total of 33 wides, which proved the top contributor as Gunnedah overhauled the target in 23 overs. \n\nArmidale needed a further 60 runs with six wickets in hand to win against Moree.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Samantha Newsam and Gregor Mactaggart"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Blue\u2019s bowlers come to aid in Connolly Cup","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2340","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Tamworth","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Northern Daily Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169733885","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"28"},"name":"Northern Daily Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","Cricket"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.northerndailyleader.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203692988","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:20:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/ingYyB85ps4jmG9t8mfsHP/5550fb1f-f764-4337-bb63-7a815259a230.jpg/r0_168_3000_1863_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kesler drifted to his right, waited for Price to move with him and then slipped the puck between the goaltender\u2019s legs and into the back of the net. \n \nKesler fell to the ice, leaped to his skates and began pumping his arms in celebration. \n \nBedlam. \n \nWait, who in the heck is Ryker Kesler, you ask? \n \nWell, he is the 6-year-old son of Ryan Kesler, the Ducks\u2019 All-Star center, and he stole the show on the eve of the All-Star Game while wearing an enemy jersey on foreign ice, a place where Kings fans never hold back their feelings for their Southern California rivals. \n \nRyan Kesler planned to send Ryker in his place and it went better than either could have expected. Ryan Kesler was booed heavily when he was introduced before the event, reveling in it and blowing kisses to the crowd. Ryker got nothing but cheers from the fans, however. \n \n\u201cI was nervous,\u201d Ryan Kesler would later say. \u201cI was more nervous than him. \u2026 Amazing. It was pretty special. It was the perfect ending.\u201d \n \nAsked about Ryker\u2019s celebration, Ryan said, \u201cI think I taught you that, right?\u201d \n \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Ryker said, smiling while standing with his dad in a crowded dressing room. \n \nThe Atlantic Division defeated the Keslers\u2019 Pacific Division in the shootout 4-1 and earned the right to pick its opponent for Sunday\u2019s 3-on-3 semifinal tournament. The Atlantic selected to play the Metropolitan in the second 20-minute semifinal. The defending champion Pacific will face the Central in the first semi. \n \nThe winners then face off in the third period. \n Hardest shot  \nMontreal Canadiens defenseman Shea Weber went into the event as the defending champion, winning on home ice last season while playing with the Nashville Predators. There was some that thought that he could break the all-time record of 108.8 mph by Boston Bruins defenseman Zdeno Chara. \n \nWeber won, but he didn\u2019t come close to Chara\u2019s mark, posting a speed of 102.8 mph on a slap shot launched from a distance of 30 feet directly in front of the net. Winnipeg Jets rookie Patrik Laine was second with a speed of 101.7. Kings defenseman Drew Doughty\u2019s fastest shot was 94.6 mph. \n \nEach shooter had two attempts. \n \n\u201cThe first one, I felt like I hit good,\u201d Weber said. \u201cI thought it would be a little bit harder. I was saving more for the second shot because I was sitting around for two hours. I kind of wanted to work my way up. And then I missed the second one. I hit it too far behind the puck and kind of missed it.\u201d \n \n Skills challenge relay  \nThis timed relay event involved seven skaters and one goalie from each of the teams, and was probably the least well-received by an announced sellout crowd of more than 18,000. One-timed shooting, accuracy passing, puck control and stick-handling were the disciplines involved. \n \nThe Metropolitan Division, including Washington\u2019s Alexander Ovechkin and Pittsburgh\u2019s Sidney Crosby, posted a winning time of 1 minute, 21.70 seconds. The Atlantic was second in 1:39.69, the Central was third in 1:44.03 and the Pacific was fourth in 2:02.12. \n \nJoe Pavelski of the Sharks and Kesler scored on their first tries on their one-timers, getting the Pacific off to a good start. Jeff Carter of the Kings misfired on his first two tries before hitting the net and then Doughty struggled to find the mark in the passing portion. \n Faster skater  \nConnor McDavid\u2019s blinding speed pops up often in nightly highlight shows and Edmonton\u2019s 20-year-old star backed up the perception that he is the NHL\u2019s fastest skater as he had the quickest time out of the eight participants. \n \nMcDavid beat another fleet skater, Colorado\u2019s Nathan MacKinnon, in his head-to-head race as he covered the rink layout in 13.020 seconds to MacKinnon\u2019s 13.620. \n \n\u201cHe\u2019s unbelievable fast,\u201d McDavid said. \u201cI was really nervous. I was a little worried. I thought he was going to fly. Definitely a great skater in his own way.\u201d \n \nSaid MacKinnon, joking he got caught sleeping: \u201cNot a bad guy to lose to.\u201d \n \nMcDavid\u2019s best time was better than the record of 13.172 seconds set by Detroit\u2019s Dylan Larkin last year. It won\u2019t be recognized as such because McDavid didn\u2019t do it in the full lap at the end after beating MacKinnon, with his final skate clocking in at 13.310. \n \nAlready, there was a \u201ccontroversy\u201d brewing because McDavid began from a full stop while Larkin was able to begin his start already in motion. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019d be nice to see if you got a running start like last time,\u201d McDavid said. \u201cWould that shave off .2 seconds? I\u2019m not too sure.\u201d \n Four line challenge  \nMike Smith doesn\u2019t have All-Star numbers as the goalie for struggling Arizona. Smith is 11-13-5 with a 2.85 goals-against average and a .917 save percentage but he is in the game as the Coyotes\u2019 representative. \n \nAs one of the NHL\u2019s best handlers of the puck among netminders, Smith validated his appearance by shooting the puck the length of the ice from his own net into a tight opening at the opposing end. \n \n\u201cI knew it had a chance but I didn\u2019t know it was going to curl in like that,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI think I was just as surprised as Bo Horvat was. Looking over at him was a pretty cool moment.\u201d \n \nSmith said he didn\u2019t put any extra English on his shot and that \u201cit was more fluke than anything.\u201d But the shot got a huge ovation at Staples Center, where he\u2019s normally a visiting goalie to be jeered. \n \n\u201cYeah, I got booed at the start and then they came around and cheered for me at the end,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s all good. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m here for my goal scoring but it was a cool moment and probably one I\u2019ll cherish for a long time.\u201d \n Accuracy shooting  \nToronto\u2019s Auston Matthews showed off his skills by clearly hitting the four targets on each corner of the net in five tries but Pittsburgh star Sidney Crosby would better him by doing it faster in 10.730 seconds to 12.280 seconds. \n \n\u201cHe made me look bad there,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cI was feeling good about myself after and then he goes and does that. That\u2019s why he\u2019s the best player in the world.\u201d \n \nMatthews said he got pinpoint passes from Ottawa\u2019s Erik Karksson on his one-time shots but found the event more challenging than it originally looked. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s smaller than it seems,\u201d Matthews said of the targets. \u201cIt\u2019s tough just going right into it, not really warming up or anything. Of course, you\u2019re pretty nervous beforehand anyways. I think I tuned it pretty well.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Elliott Teaford"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: ice hockey news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NHL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Kid Kesler steals the show at the NHL All-Star Skills Competition","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"91365","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Woodland Hills","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Los Angeles Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169679898","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"852"},"name":"Los Angeles Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailynews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203693514","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.dailynews.com/storyimage/LA/20170128/SPORTS/170129395/AR/0/AR-170129395.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Australian Test opener Matt Renshaw is seeking the counsel of former great Matthew Hayden for tips on how to conquer spin in India as he embarks on his first Test tour. , Renshaw is not allowing himself to be daunted by the prospect of playing on the dust bowls of the subcontinent against the world's No.1 Test nation.\n\nSince recovering from concussion, the youngster has been gearing his game for the examination by spin he will face against Virat Kohli's rampaging team. His preparation has included batting on an \"extreme\" turner at Cricket Australia's National Cricket Centre in Brisbane which was designed to exaggerate the conditions he will confront in India.\n\nRenshaw is due to fly to Dubai on Monday for Australia's pre-tour camp but not before consulting fellow Queenslander Hayden, Hayden famously mastered the sweep shot after weeks of intense practice with his brother on a specially made dusty pitch in Brisbane. His haul of 549 runs at 109.8 in three matches is the second most by an Australian in India, behind only Kim Hughes, who hit 594 runs from a six-Test series in 1979/80.\n\nWhile Australia failed to end their drought in 2001, Hayden's success on that campaign instilled great confidence in his teammates for the successful 2004 mission.\n\n\"I got his number off Andy Bichel, so I might give him a call to get a few quick pointers before I head off,\" Renshaw said. \"I'm not as experienced in the sweep shot as him. [\"I'll have] a fair bit more practice over the next couple of months.\n\nDespite honing his craft on the bouncy Gabba wicket, Renshaw says he is confident against spin, although there are no players in Australia in the class of Indian duo Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.\n\n\"I'm not too bad against spin in Australia but I've never experienced spin in India, so it's hard to say [how I will go],\" Renshaw said.\n\nUnder the watch of Queensland coach Phil Jaques, Renshaw has been preparing on a pitch that is offering more spin and bounce than what he will get in India and, in his own words, \"didn't go too badly\".\n\n\"If it's harder there, it can go into a game and it gets a bit easier,\" Renshaw said. \"There's a wicket at the NCC in the indoor nets that turns a lot more, it's a bit less realistic than the Mumbai wickets at AB [Allan Border] Field. It's not the worst thing to practice on.\"\n\nRenshaw's lack of experience on the subcontinent can be seen as a negative, though the glass half full view is it means he does not bear the scars of previous failures.\n\n\"I think it helps that I've not been there. It's a challenge. I like to get up for challenges and to love the contest,\" he said.\n\nRenshaw said he would not be concerned if asked to field in close again despite suffering concussion after being hit on the helmet at short leg during the Sydney Test.\n\nThe injury resulted in him becoming the first player to be withdrawn from a Test under Cricket Australia's stringent concussion rules.\n\n\"If I have to do it in India I wouldn't be too mentally scarred from it. I'd be trying to get a couple of catches in there and win a series,\" Renshaw said. \"They [the doctors] just said I need to stop headbutting the ball.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrew Wu"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"India v Australia Test series: Matt Renshaw to consult Matthew Hayden for tips to play spin in India","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2340","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Tamworth","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Northern Daily Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169733885","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"28"},"name":"Northern Daily Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","Cricket"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.northerndailyleader.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203696097","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:40:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That should definitely tell the market they are committed to the story.\" \n \nInvestors tend to get spooked when directors divest out of their firms, but Mr Mason says it pays to look at the nature of those holdings compared to their personal net wealth. \n \n\"You can have cases where an entrepreneur has founded a company and literally everything he owns is shares in that company,\" says Mr Mason. \"As long as his holding remains significant, he might have sold a bit to pay for a house or something, that's not necessarily a sign the company is about to collapse.\" \n \n   \nBut investors do sometimes tend to get spooked when directors sell. \n \nShares in construction software company Aconex  took a belting in November last year as news broke two executive directors, Leigh Jasper and Robert Phillpot, and a non-executive director, Simon Yencken, had cashed in a portion of their holdings. This, combined with questions about the company's seemingly opaque accounting practices, saw the stock more than halve from its intra-year high.  \n \n\"The market saw those directors sell out and gave the share price a beating, but it amounted to like a 2 per cent sale,\" says Mr Mason. \"What's important is they still have meaningful holdings and their remuneration structure is closely aligned with the company's goals.\" \n \nRBC points to the structure of data centre firm NEXTDC's remuneration target  as one that cleanly aligns shareholder priorities with that of the company. \n \nThe long and short-term incentive plans of chief executive Craig Scroggie are directly linked to growing the revenue base as fast as possible as well as building out key assets before anybody else does.  \n \n\"Broadly, having remuneration structures that have a bigger tilt towards short-term incentives is a better screen for shareholders,\" says Mr Mason. \"With NEXTDC, they don't contemplate earnings-per-share so much which deals with dilution, they're more worried about building out their assets.\" \n \nIt also doesn't hurt that Mr Scroggie has been consistently buying up the company's stock on the ASX.  \n \nBut having a chief executive who is also a major shareholder can sometimes frustrate fellow shareholders, who might feel their voices may not be heard should they want to question the company's direction.  \n \nChief executive of logistics software company WiseTech, Richard White, owns more than half the stock in the company making his involvement in the business deeply entwined.  \n \n\"With those kinds of holdings, you have to completely agree with their strategy in order to invest alongside them,\" says Mr Mason. \n \n\"While shareholder activism hasn't been a massive theme in this sector yet, it could be an issue if you disagreed with management who also held such large positions.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Equity markets news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Investors should look at tech incentives","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Sydney Morning Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587970","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Sydney Morning Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.smh.com.au/","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.afr.com/brand/rear-window/aconex-story-hard-to-swallow-as-chiefs-quit-holding-it-20161121-gsu2xk","http://www.afr.com/brand/chanticleer/battle-of-the-data-centres-hits-tech-stock-darling-nextdc-20161128-gsze1k","http://www.afr.com/technology/wisetech-ceo-richard-white-is-not-going-anywhere-but-he-has-a-succession-plan-20160829-gr459y"],"sequenceId":"695203696449","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution.

With more than 20 million women and 10 million men suffering with eating disorders at one point in their life, this is a major issue in society that needs to be discussed.  \n \nEating disorders like anorexia and bulimia can cause many serious medical issues, such as muscle loss and osteoporosis, as well as mental health issues like depression and anxiety. \n \nEven kids as young as elementary school are worried about their weight, and how they are perceived by others, and that should not be what these young people are worrying about. This situation is causing mental illness to occur in younger and younger children every year, and increasing the amount of issues related to eating disorders. \n \nWhat is to blame for these unhealthy body images? Many believe that the media could be to blame.  \n \nLooking at the photoshopped models on the covers of magazines, or seeing the celebrities who look almost unrecognizable due to the amount of plastic surgery they have had done could be causing young people to think they must change things about themselves to fit into what they see all around them. \n \nThroughout the years, the definition of beauty has changed dramatically. In the 1950s, a woman was considered to be the \u201cepitome of beauty\u201d if she was curvy with an hourglass figure and looked absolutely perfect from head to toe every time she left the house. \n \nToday\u2019s standard of beauty has changed dramatically. Today\u2019s idea of beauty is to be muscular and toned, and have flawless teeth and skin. \n \nBut for many people, it is impossible to change such physical things about themselves. People with acne, for instance, may struggle for years trying to get rid of it, but may be stuck with it for the rest of their lives. \n \nThere is not much representation of people with different body types in the media. Many actors and actresses are put on a pedestal, and are held to very high standards. This leads to the unhealthy thought that everyone is the same, but that\u2019s just not possible. \n \nGenetics and different ethnicities give people different body types, which can lead to some folks hurting themselves to look like someone who they just can\u2019t look like. Many beauty product commercials shame both men and women, pointing out flaws and encouraging them to buy their product so they can be considered \u201cnormal.\u201d \n \nWhile there is a lot of pressure put on women about appearance, such as having long beautiful hair, long legs and perfect skin, the media does not just affect women. Men are also affected by the media\u2019s representation of what men should look like. Men are expected to have perfect hair, rippling muscles and tan skin. If men are affected by eating disorders and mental illness, they are told to \u201cman up\u201d because they should be strong and not show any weakness. \n \nOne way to help future generations accept themselves for who they are is to provide more representation of different types of people, from all different types of backgrounds in the media. \n \nIf there is a plus-sized model on the cover of a magazine, or there are people of color acting more in major films, future generations will see that there is nothing to be ashamed of, and that we should support everyone\u2019s differences. \n \nMaybe then, if we learn to accept everyone for who they are, body image issues will be a thing of the past, and people will not feel the need to change the things they have no control over. \n \nAnd maybe women and men can finally feel comfortable in their own skin. \n \nSam Morby is a junior at Syracuse High School.

If you've watched Cowspiracy , heard about Veganuary or even visited Clapham Common station , you'll be aware that eating vegan may be the best thing you can do for the environment. One report has even claimed that the meat industry could be responsible for 51% of global greenhouse gas emissions. But what are you supposed to do if you want to be good to the planet but can't face a life without cheeseburgers? \n \nThe first and most important thing is to really consider where our food comes from. Every day, we make hundreds of small choices about what we eat and each one has a huge effect on the environment. Before it even reaches our plate, food is raised or grown somewhere in the world, then clipped, shipped, refrigerated, processed, packaged, trucked, stored, sold and cooked. It might feel like the environmental impact of the food industry is beyond our control, but we can all be more mindful of what we put in our mouths and make it better not just for ourselves, but for the entire planet. \n  \n\n    \nPick the best ingredients \n \nLet's just agree that growing enough food for seven billion humans takes a lot out of our planet. We use over 70% of the world's water to grow our food, 37% of our landmass is devoted to feeding us and almost 30% of the global population is, one way or another, employed by agriculture. Meat and dairy are two of the most energy-inefficient food groups; for instance, it takes 255 litres of water to produce a glass of milk , compared to 27 litres of water for one cup of tea (black, of course). In general, fruit and vegetables require much less water \u2013 but even then, not all vegetables are good for the planet. \n \nUnfortunately, this includes the toast topper du jour: avocados. Greenpeace Mexico has warned that, due to our love of guacamole, Mexican drug cartels are taking over avocado production, terrorising local communities and forcing farmers to deforest land to grow avocados and use illegal chemicals on their fields. Even if your avos don't come from Mexico, their production involves a lot of water \u2013 it can take more than 1,000 litres to grow two medium avocados. \n \nAlmonds, too, require a crazy amount of water \u2013 over five litres per almond \u2013 and can only be grown in very specific environments, which are slowly being racked by drought. And that's before these tasty seeds (yep, we thought they were nuts, too) are shipped off to be processed into almond milk, packaged and shipped back around the world. A single gram of chocolate, meanwhile, uses over 170 litres of water. \n \nQuick and easy tip: \n \nSwitch avocados for lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber \n \nAvocados need so much water because they have evolved to grow in wet, tropical climates. It's possible to grow the same amount of equally delicious European veggies \u2013 like tomatoes, cucumber and lettuce \u2013 for less than one tenth of the water sucked up by the food blogger fave. \n Photo: Shanice Garcia  More   \n\n    \nAvoid processed food \n \nProcessed food has a bad reputation for what it does to your insides but have you ever thought about what it does to our environment? Generally, the further your food has travelled, the more energy and water it's used. The long list of ingredients means it probably has a pretty considerable carbon footprint. \n \nIf you cook your food from scratch, the environmental impact is easy to assess. Once grown, cleaned and shipped to store, you transport your ingredients to your home, prepare and cook them, then dispose of any leftovers or packaging. Walking to the shops or choosing an energy-efficient cooker will reduce this impact further. \n \nBut if you buy your food pre-processed or pre-cooked it becomes much trickier. Raw ingredients are usually frozen and shipped from all over the world to various factories, cut and cooked down before being packaged and shipped again to a depot. From there, they'll be transported to your local supermarket for you to chuck in your basket, take home and cook all over again. Generally, you have no control over where those ingredients come from, how energy-efficient those factories are or how much waste or pollution was created along the way. \n \nWe get it. When you're on the go, processed food can be a lifesaver \u2013 but if you have time to cook from scratch using fresh ingredients, you'll be so much greener. No matter how healthy processed food claims to be, fresh is usually better for you and better for the planet. Cutting out processed food could also drastically reduce your food packaging. \n \nQuick and easy tip: \n \nMake your own pasta sauce \n \nA simple jar of pasta sauce often contains a lot of processed ingredients, including modified ones like fructose and maize starch. Why not try one of these simple pasta dishes instead \u2013 you can even make them when your fridge is bare. \n Photo: Carissa Gan  More   \n\n    \nUnpackage \n \nYes, packaging! We all know the drill: less packaging = better for the environment. You might already be using canvas bags instead of plastic, but there is more that you can do. \n \nBefore you buy your food, check to see if the packaging is recyclable \u2013 not all of it will be, but these symbols will let you know what you can recycle, and what will have to go in the bin. Also, look to see how much packaging there is in total; boxes of loose teabags or tealeaves are greener than individually wrapped teabags, for example. Think about buying bigger packs of dry goods, as well. You can store most uncooked rice almost indefinitely , and one 2kg bag has far less packaging than four 500g bags (plus it's usually cheaper). \n \nWhere you can, though, avoid packaging full-stop. Look for fresh food sold loose rather than in packs \u2013 it uses less energy when being transported from field to factory. Buying your vegetables loose or your meat, fish and bread from the deli counters in supermarkets can really reduce the amount of packaging you take home, too. And if your nearest supermarket doesn't have a deli counter, try shopping locally. \n \nQuick and easy tip: \n \nTake inspiration from zero waste living \n \nBelieve it or not, some people \u2013 like TheZeroWasteGirl and ZeroWasteNerd \u2013 live a life virtually free from waste by reducing the packaging they consume. This is by no means quick or easy, but check out our guide to zero waste living and see how you can cut down your packaging, too. \n Photo: Lukas Budimaier  More   \n\n    \nEat local \n \nIf you're lucky enough to have a local greengrocer, fishmonger, baker or butcher, please try and shop there. Independent shops are sometimes a little more expensive than supermarkets but if you support them, they will support you back. Studies have found that small businesses may be better for the economy, community and of course the environment. If you shop close to home, you can avoid driving long distances and are more likely to buy produce that was grown or created locally. This is incredibly important. \n \nIn any UK supermarket you'll find food imported from countries like Vietnam, Peru and the Netherlands, which requires huge resources. In 2007, the Natural Resources Defense Council found that importing food was responsible for over 250,000 tons of global warming gases. That's the equivalent of almost two power plants. Before you buy, think about what it took to get that food to you. \n \nNot all food can be local, of course, but where you can, eating vegetables, meat, fish and grains grown or raised in the UK or Europe is good for the planet. If you have no choice but to shop at a supermarket, look out for the country of origin on the packaging and choose one close to home. \n \nQuick and easy tip: \n \nSubscribe to a local veg box \n \nIf you don't have a local greengrocer or can't easily get there, try subscribing to a veg box. Search online to find a fresh, local and often organic fruit and vegetable box that can be delivered straight to your door. \n Photo: Leonie Wise  More   \n\n    \nStop wasting your food \n \nFood waste happens all the time, all over the world. The World Resources Institute found that, between being grown and getting to your plate, about 25% of the world's food is lost or wasted. Often this is because food goes off during transport, because factories process food poorly or because supermarkets throw it away. WRAP says that the UK alone wastes 10 million tonnes of food each year, 60% of which could be avoided. If Europe stopped wasting food today, we could feed 200 million people. Eating local, unprocessed food can help \u2013 but the scary fact is, 70% of UK food waste happens in our own homes. \n \nPartly, this is down to packaging and supermarkets. Over half of the food we waste hasn't been used 'in time', including 17 billion portions of fresh produce. We've all done it \u2013 thrown away that surplus pepper when the stir fry recipe only calls for two. The easiest way to avoid doing this is to stop buying packs in the first place: if you need two peppers, buy two peppers. And if that seems like too much of a faff, have a regular check of your fridge. If you have food that's about to go off, cook it and freeze it. Love Food Hate Waste has tons of tips on how to use your leftovers. \n \nBut first, learn what 'gone off' actually means. 'Best before' dates, according to both the NHS and the Food Standards Agency, are simply an indication of when food will be at its freshest, not when you should throw it away. Both 'sell by' and 'display until' dates are added by the supermarket, not by an authority: store your food well and, even past these dates, if it's not mouldy or yeasty, it's probably fine to cook with or freeze. But pay attention to anything marked 'use by' \u2013 after this date, food may become contaminated with bugs like norovirus. Reducing waste is important but if food has passed its 'use by' date it could make you ill, so throw it away. \n \nIf you do need to throw food away, ask your council for a food waste bin and cut down on the amount of food waste in landfill. If all edible food waste in the UK was eaten or properly disposed of, it would reduce as much CO2 as taking a quarter of cars off the road. \n \nQuick and easy tip: \n \nLearn to love leftovers \n \nIt's easy to throw away an extra portion instead of saving it but cooked food can last three to four days when refrigerated, and will do nicely for a packed lunch. Check out our guide to see how long your leftovers will last. \n Photo: Elli O  More   \n\n    \nEat meat and fish, but better \n \nHere's what you don't want to hear: the meat industry is seriously damaging the planet. Factory farming has led to deforestation, vast greenhouse gas emissions, waste dumping and massive water consumption. But if you do eat meat (like 90% of the population), it is possible to make environmentally friendly choices. On top of everything we've already mentioned, the biggest things you can do are buy from small farms and eat the right kinds of meat. \n \nThe biggest environmental impact comes from factory farming so try to buy from small, sustainable farms, which usually treat their animals more kindly. If your meat is labelled 'pasture fed' or 'grass fed', the animals will eat naturally growing grass rather than grain, which has to be shipped to the farm. If you buy meat labelled 'organic', the farm won't have used chemical pesticides or fertilisers, which means less water pollution and chemical runoff. Shop at a butcher? Ask them which meat is farmed nearby and in the most environmentally friendly way. Some meats are kinder to the planet than others, too. The Good Fish Guide tells you what to buy to help fight overfishing, like choosing Pacific instead of Atlantic salmon. \n \nThe best thing a meat-eater can do to help the planet, though, is to cut out beef. Studies show that the carbon footprint of a meat-eater who avoids just beef is almost the same as a vegetarian's. The National Academy of Sciences in the US confirms that beef needs 28 times more land and produces five times more greenhouse gases than other meats. Being kind to the planet could be as easy as ordering chicken instead of beef. \n \nQuick and easy tip: \n \nBecome a flexitarian \n \nAll meat impacts the environment so if you can't give it up altogether, try Meat Free Mondays or only eating meat on the weekends \u2013 otherwise known as flexitarianism.

Night Shyamalan\u2019s \u201cSplit\u201d in one sentence, I would say it has personality. Lots of personality. \n \nThe psychological thriller is about Casey, Claire and Marcia (Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula), three high school girls who are kidnapped. Their assailant is Kevin Crumb, a man with dissociative identity disorder, resulting in 23 separate identities in one body. \n \nJames McAvoy, who plays Kevin \u2014 and Dennis, Patricia and the rest of Kevin\u2019s \u201calters\u201d \u2014 shows off his extensive acting abilities as he plays multiple characters mostly through voice and body language alone. The switches in demeanor are almost reminiscent of a theater-character exercise, they are so quickly and drastically portrayed. \n \nThe dissociative personality disorder isn\u2019t the twist of \u201cSplit,\u201d though; revealed from the start, it is not one of the many surprises that await. \n \nKevin\u2019s therapist Dr. Fletcher (Betty Buckley) sprinkles exposition by the handful throughout the movie, but also provides another layer of character that the film sorely needed. Out of the three kidnapped girls. Casey is the most fleshed out, her backstory being revealed through tasteful flashbacks. \n \n\u2022 Story continues below video   \n \n[embedded content] \n \nFor the first half of the movie, tension was evenly balanced, the creeping confusion of the unknown perfectly interspersed with laughable moments. The second half was where it fell flat. \u201cSplit\u201d felt choppy and hurriedly borrowed from common horror movies. \n \nThe movie is rated PG-13, yet presented its main actresses unnecessarily half-dressed for a good portion of the feature. I had high hopes for great character development, but whether it was too tight of a script or just bad writing, there was simply no room for growth. \n \nYet the near absence of gore was a refreshing breath of air in the otherwise blood-soaked horror industry. An appropriately balanced score added to the atmosphere of \u201cSplit,\u201d and good cinematography brought the tone of the movie to a suspenseful simmer. \n \nOverall, I would say that \u201cSplit\u201d is a film best for watching at home with friends and cheap pizza. The movie wasn\u2019t bad by any means, but as I watched the end credits roll, I felt unsatisfied. \n \nThe only explanation I can think of is that the hype surrounding \u201cSplit\u201d was just too great, and I had mistakenly expected more from the film. \n \nAnnika Hinman is a senior at Venture High School.

It was what they didn't find that caused them to spring into action. \n \nThe shotgun and handgun were missing, along with boxes of extra ammunition. Dropping everything, the parents drove to the junior high. As they ran into the building, the sound of a single shot reverberated through the school, sending the school into lockdown. \n \nThe story which isn't being told is how a student and a science teacher in the classroom began to talk the shooter down. The teacher acted on hours of gun violence training, and possibly saved the lives of the students in the class. The student who stepped up was in no way obligated to do so but both the student and teacher were willing to put their lives at risk to save their friends and classmates. \n \nBountiful Police Chief Tom Ross said in news reports that the student and teacher were able to talk to the suspect long enough to distract him, giving his mom enough time to intervene. \n \n\"A teacher and a student in that room immediately engaged him verbally in trying to talk him out of doing this,\" Ross told the press. \"I believe those seconds played a big role in the outcome.\" \n \nFremont High likewise had a student who saved the lives in one of our classrooms in 2014, reporting to the school officer that they had seen a gun in the waistband of another student. Seniors remember that Wednesday two years ago \u2014 all classrooms placed on lockdown, due to uncertainty about whether there were more suspects involved. \n \nWe sat in our classrooms during the lockdown, some laughing to release tension, some crying with fear, some stone-faced with anxiety. Some kids called their mothers while others scanned social media platforms in an attempt to gain information. Students in English classes soon tweeted and texted about the snipers on the roof of the school, visible from the windows. \n \nClass by class, students and teachers were evacuated from our Plain City school, leaving their backpacks and belongings in classrooms to be checked by officers and bomb detection dogs that night. \n \nSWAT team members frisked us for weapons and then we were led by a convoy of officers out of the school and onto the football field. It was freezing outside as we waited for rides home from parents, neighbors and friends. \n \nThe lockdown drills replayed in our minds, and all of us are still grateful to this day for the unnamed student who wasn't afraid to speak up. \n \nThe next week, after the Fremont lockdown, an assembly was held to help inform students about gun violence, bullying and what to do in similar situations. However, there hasn't been much information given since then. \n \nIn light of recent events in schools, why haven't we had more assemblies and drills, or received information about how to prevent, spot and act in gun violence situations? The release of the body cam video of the Bountiful police officer who was the first to arrive at the scene at Mueller Park Junior High, and the viral video \"Evan\" released by the victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting about noticing signs of gun violence, make me wonder if students know how to react in such a situation. \n \nWe have the support system set in place, but are we utilizing it to its full potential? \n \nFremont High, as well as all middle and high schools in the Weber School District, have a Student Response Team. The members of the team participate in training every year about suicide, depression, mental illness, bullying, violence, and some basic counseling strategies to help students. \n \nWhile these students are not counselors themselves, they are critical in bringing other students to counselors and safe places in each school where they can get help. \n \nPeople talk about the elephant in the room, but the training students receive doesn't fully cover school shootings. If we are to prevent gun violence, shouldn't the school address how to look for signs and what to do if a situation were to occur? \n \nI believe the reason is similar to a myth that surrounds discussion of suicide. Talking about the effects of suicide, and how to prevent it, doesn't make people suicidal. Talking about the effects of gun violence in schools, and how to prevent it, doesn't make people want to become aggressors. \n \nI believe we would benefit from yearly training, in class or through an assembly, with students who were in the lockdown, and with officers who have been at the scenes of school shootings or have helped prevent gun violence in schools. The recent anti texting and driving campaign in schools hit home because a real person whose life was affected by texting and driving \u2014 not an expert \u2014 spoke to us. \n \nTo drive the gun-violence message home, having a presentation of the facts, and what to look for and what to do, would make a larger, longer-lasting impact to help prevent similar tragedies in our schools \u2014 and to help students like me feel safer. \n \nMaddison Tenney is a senior at Fremont High School.

But 3-pointers by Deb Holcomb from the left baseline and Jasmine Green from the right corner, and Holcomb's driving layup gave the Lions a 54-52 lead with 1:40 left. \n \nThe Bronchos tied the game on Anderson's two free throws with 54 seconds remaining, and UCO's defense then kept the Lions from getting a good look at the basket. But just before the shot clock expired, Holcomb launched a shot from about 28 feet on the right side, and the ball banked off the glass and directly into the basket for a three-point lead with 24.1 seconds left. \n \n\"I knew the shot clock was going down,\" Holcomb said. \"Really I just wanted to hit the rim to give us a chance to get the rebound. I heard Coach saying 'step back, do the step back,' and I was thinking to myself I'm already I feel like 40 feet off the line. I shot it, and it went in.\" \n \nMurillo made two more free throws to make it a one-point game with 24 seconds left, and it took the Bronchos 13 seconds to commit four fouls and put the Lions at the foul line where Henry made both charities for a 59-56 lead with 11.5 seconds to play. \n \nThe Bronchos' Olivia Mason had the ball on the left side and wanted to shoot a 3, but the ball was touched and wound up in the hands of Jesheon Cooper, who turned and made a shot from the foul line with 6 seconds left. \n \nHenry was fouled again \u2014 winding up on the floor in front of the MSSU bench. This time she missed the first free throw but made the second for a 60-58 lead with 5.4 on the clock. \n \n\"You have to make sure you don't get rattled, especially when you get thrown into the bench and have to shoot a free throw,\" Henry said. \"You work on free throws every day in the gym. I shoot about 100 a day. ... If I could go back, I would have taken more time on that first shot because my head was kind of hurting after being thrown into the bench. Free throws are repetition, and I'm confident in myself at the free-throw line.\" \n \nUCO advanced the ball to the front court with a timeout. From the sideline Blake Blessington threw the ball inbounds to Anderson on the left side, and she pivoted and hit a 3-pointer \u2014 her only 3-point shot of the game \u2014 with 3.4 to play. \n \n\"We were going to shoot a 3 for the win because we'd been struggling all day,\" UCO coach Guy Hardaker said. \"They guarded us like nobody has guarded us all year. And if we can't get a clean look, throw it inside and we'll try to play for overtime.\" \n \nThe Lions went to a zone defense on the possession. \n \n\"We felt we can guard the 3 a little better,\" Ressel said, \"because some of their screening action, they'll pop out Mason and she's a great shooter. If she pops, it's hard for us to recover back. We had a miscue that we didn't recover back and check the shot. \n \n\"Those things are going to happen. I told the kids there are 500 things that I will think about tonight I could have done a lot different that may have changed the outcome of the game. I told them to keep their heads up. I'm proud of them because they played so hard.\" \n \nOn the Lions' final possession, Jenson Maydew's pass for Desirea Buerge at midcourt was high, and the Bronchos grabbed the ball and dribbled out the clock. \n \nHenry and Holcomb finished with 16 points apiece for the Lions, and Buerge and Maydew both contributed 11. Buerge, battling against Cooper on the inside, came up with five steals, and Maydew snagged nine rebounds as the Lions outrebounded the bigger Bronchos 37-34. \n \nMason scored 15 for UCO, including 11 in a five-minute stretch in the second quarter. Cooper had 14 points, nine rebounds and three blocks, and Murillo added 13.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jim Henry jhenry@joplinglobe.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Late 3 lifts No. 10 UCO past MSSU women","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jasper","zipCode":"64801","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Joplin","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Joplin Globe","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672979","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3234"},"name":"Joplin Globe","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.joplinglobe.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203714635","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/joplinglobe.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/10/b1068922-ac88-5893-b93f-b5694669450a/588d68ebb7ebb.image.jpg?resize=300%2C344"}],"video":[]}}

But Vince Fritz nailed a 3 from the right corner as the Lions scored six points in 56 seconds and tied it at 70 when Lawrence Brown made 1-of-2 free throws with 2:03 left. \n \nIt was 73-73 after regulation as Fritz tipped away a lob pass near the basket and Brown grabbed the ball, and the Lions' JJ Cratit shot a contested 30-footer that was on line but short. \n \nMissouri Southern fell behind again 79-76 midway through overtime, but five free throws \u2014 one by Brown and two apiece by Parker Jennings and Carr \u2014 put the Lions ahead 81-79 \u2014 their first lead since the opening minutes of the second half. \n \nThe Bronchos (12-7, 7-4) received a free throw from Jordan London and, after an MSSU turnover, a bucket by Byford in the lane for a one-point lead with 89 seconds left. \n \nAfter a Lion timeout, Carr got the ball, dribbled across the lane and made a tough left-handed shot for a one-point lead with 8.1 seconds left. \n \n\"Coach drew up a great play where Parker and Vince crossed, which let me to penetrate into the open lane,\" said Carr, who finished with 16 points and eight assists. \"Luckily there was an easy enough layup for me to make. It was a great play by Coach.\" \n \n\"Either man or zone, we wanted to get CJ the ball at the top, cut the guards a little bit and try to get CJ's man to bite a little bit,\" Lions coach Jeff Boschee said. \"I told CJ as soon as you see your guy hesitate when those guys cut through, drive it. It's fortunate that we have a guy who can make the play.\" \n \nStill, the Bronchos had plenty of time to get off a shot, but they never got a good look and Corey Alpough missed a contested shot near the 3-point arc on the right wing. \n \n\"A little bit of concern (leaving so much time on the clock),\" Boschee admitted. \"If we missed it, we'd have some time to foul and maybe come back and get another opportunity.\" \n \n\"It was a matter of heart by our guys,\" Carr said. \"Coaches really prepared us for this game. We wouldn't have won this game earlier in the season.\" \n \nCratit and Elyjah Clark tallied 21 points apiece to lead the Lions, and Brown scored 20, hitting 7-of-11 field goals and 6-of-12 free throws. Brown and Clark shared the team lead with seven rebounds. \n \n\"I'm playing closer to the basket,\" Brown said. \"I'm more efficient down there.\" \n \n\"I was really proud of Lawrence the way he played with four fouls without fouling, especially guarding those big kids down low,\" Boschee said. \"Toward the end when we started to press, Vince comes up with a huge steal. I thought that was a big contributing factor to us winning the game. Just little plays ... we got to the free throw line 37 times.

I would call it a tryst \u2014 with sex the same time and the same place almost every day in a five-day workweek. \"Count 'em!\" That's about 1,000 encounters, taking time out for the birth of three babies, vacations, etc. \n \nThe hurt has been indescribable. I think about it constantly. Fortunately, I have found a psychologist I can vent to. I keep telling myself it was 55 years ago, but it seems like yesterday. I still have my unfaithful wife; she has no place to go, and alas, I still love her. \n \nDuring that five-year period, three boys were born. The last one I am sure is not mine. He is aware that he is different from his siblings and has asked me whether he could have been switched at birth. The biological father is dead. I think our son should know who he was, but his mother does not. We are 80 years old and the only ones to know, and time is running out to tell him. With doctors using DNA information and with Ancestry.com, etc., it is only a matter of time before he finds out he has different genes than his siblings. \n \nI love him very much and don't want him to think I was involved in wife swapping or somehow a party to the affair. It is bad enough to know that he is the product of a cheating mother. My wife tells me she has no remorse, guilt or shame, but she cares about what our son would think of her. Tell him? Your opinion, please. \u2014 It Was \"Only\" Sex \n \nDear Only: Should you tell your son? I'm inclined to say no. There's no point in upsetting the balance and making him feel more like an outsider. Besides, he already knows who his real dad is: you. \n \nBut if his biological father suffered from any conditions of which genetics are a good predictor, then your son should be aware of that medical history. Raise that concern with your wife. She should want him to be equipped with all the best information to lead a long, healthy life. \n \nI can't imagine the range of emotions you must be cycling through on a daily basis. I'm happy that you've found a therapist who can help you process things. Keep going. The sting of your wife's revelation will lessen with time. \n \nDear Annie: I just read the letter from \"Inbox Infinity,\" who was stressed out by having nearly 7,000 unread emails. I understand completely. I procrastinate, have generalized anxiety and attention deficit disorder, and am a perfectionist. \n \nPlease suggest to \"Inbox\" that he or she can start the culling process painlessly by signing up for Unroll.Me, which was suggested to me by a website for adults with ADD. It is an amazing, simple program that will compile your incoming emails into a \"daily digest\" and make it easy to unsubscribe from what you don't want. \n \nUnroll.Me will not do anything about the emails already archived in your inbox, however. It only organizes incoming mail. For those 7,000 pesky emails, I would suggest some tough love. Delete them. Simple as that. If they haven't been looked at in a week, a month or a year, they most likely are not important or have expired. Don't even look at them. Just delete them! \n \nAs for family members, consider emailing them after the purge, explaining that you want to reconnect but recently deleted a whole bunch of emails. They will understand, as they probably have several thousand archived emails also! \u2014 Been There, Done That \n \nSend your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie@creators.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"DEAR ANNIE: The fruit of an affair","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203721530","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They also gave me the interest in doing what I\u2019m doing right now \u2014 writing. I was surprised at how sad I was to learn about Mr. Haggerty\u2019s passing. He wasn\u2019t part of my daily life. I had only seen him a handful of times since graduating. Yet, something about the news struck me. Over the years, I would stop into the little book store in North Hampton where Mr. Haggerty worked in his retirement and we\u2019d chat and catch up. He was always interested in what I was doing, what campaigns I was on, what my plans were. The fact he and I disagreed politically on almost everything never stopped the conversation from being pleasant and kind. It never stopped him from letting me know he was proud of what I was doing or had done. Mr. Haggerty didn\u2019t preach tolerance, he demonstrated it by accepting me for who I was and am. We could use some more Mr. Haggertys in the world today; maybe that\u2019s why I was so struck. \n \nSince President Trump took office just a bit more than a week ago, we have seen a Women\u2019s March and March for Life, celebrations and protests and all forms of disagreement in both social and traditional media. We have seen people preach tolerance while condemning those they disagree with. We saw acts of violence and vandalism and cowardly attacks on people who had presumably voted differently than the attacker. \n \nI worked in politics for a long time. Long enough to remember when following events or even debates, competing staffs would join each other afterward for a drink or a bite to eat. I remember Democrat and Republican lawmakers going out for dinner or lunch or after a session to talk about life outside of politics. People didn\u2019t hate each other based on voter registration. Moreover, people were able to exchange ideas, even disagreeing in an agreeable manner. There was a mutual respect for one another, even during the discussion of opposing opinions. \n \nWe are a nation of more than 300 million people. The idea that we would all agree \u2014 or that we even should \u2014 is as insane as smashing windows of Starbucks to spread tolerance. \n \nTolerance is not agreement. Quite the opposite. Tolerance means to accept the views, lives and opinions of others, without disliking them for it. It means, live and let live. Somewhere along our path, and certainly over the past two years, too many have forgotten this. \n \nI received several emails regarding last week\u2019s column, some in praise, others in disagreement. I was thrilled to be part of a dialogue even with those who didn\u2019t agree with me. I was so pleased people went out of their way to write to me and express their opinions. I learn from others' ideas and I don\u2019t shun them for having them. I celebrate the exchange of them. \n \nPeople in New Hampshire and America are all over the spectrum emotionally since the inauguration. Some are jumping with joy, others bitter and angry. Most are probably somewhere in between. Every one of the opinions and emotions are valid to the person feeling them. Why can\u2019t we embrace that reality and embrace our differences? How completely boring the nation would be if we were all the same. My stops in the little bookstore in North Hampton probably wouldn\u2019t have been as much fun either. \n \nRest well, Mr. Haggerty and thank you. Your lessons will live on in the too-many-to-count students you inspired. \n \nThat\u2019s my perspective; I\u2019d love to hear yours. You can write me your thoughts or ask me to weigh in on anything you\u2019d like and maybe your comments or topics will appear here next time. Just email me at PrestonPerspective@gmail.com. \n \nAlicia Preston is a former political consultant and member of the media.

The panel-led lecture series will once again use participatory dialogue to explore the issues of politics, history, religion and more in the community and beyond. \n \nJerriAnne Boggis, director of the Portsmouth Black Heritage Trail, recently spoke about the upcoming Tea Talks presented by the Portsmouth Black Heritage Trail in collaboration with the Seacoast African American Cultural Center and generously funded through a grant from TD Bank. \n \nThe Tea Talks cover a wide range of pertinent topics, from activism to Apartheid, from gender to religion, all in the context of history but looking to the present day. The annual series, coinciding with Black History Month, takes a community-based approach to tackling social issues, and are grounded in black history and culture. The mission of the Tea Talks, Boggis said, is \u201cfirst to explore our past and then find ways to reconcile our past. Only then can we move on, get clarity and create change. When we understand where we are coming from and where we are, we get a clearer picture of where we can go.\u201d \n \nIn The Tea Talks, panels of experts on relevant topics share their thoughts, then open the forum to public discussion. \u201cThe basis of the community dialogue format is you get around a table with a group of people and have a conversation, in a safe non-threatening environment, about uncomfortable topics like race, incarceration and bias. It is a participatory dialog, but by having scholars or experts on the subject, it becomes a learning experience for all involved and it is more focused.\u201d \n \nThe panel-led but audience-driven format goes back to the \u201clyceum\u201d format of the past, where, in town halls, churches and other venues, the people of a community would gather for discussions, lectures, performances and concerts. Boggis commented that this is an optimal environment for people to learn and share their views. \u201cCommunities used to do this at a time when there was less distraction and more discussion. When neighbors come together to talk about difficult issues, we can create change through a genuine desire to understand each other.\u201d \n \nThe mission of the Tea Talks, according to Boggis, is to take the focus of Black History Month and expand it into a discussion of current social issues. \n \n\u201cThe talks explore aspects of black history and culture in our state and throughout New England, because often there can be a national or global connection. Our founding fathers talked about working to \u2018create a more perfect union,\u2019 which ultimately is something we can only do in small community environments,\" Boggis said. \"We can find that dialogue is more powerful than legislation. Talks like these are the start of addressing issues important to our nation.\u201d \n \nTopics for the series of Tea Talks change every year and explore a wide range of subjects. \n \n\u201cWhere we are right now in the political environment, there\u2019s so much division, so much focus on people's \u2018otherness\u2019. In choosing the topics for 2017, the first being about politics and activism, we saw the need to tackle more contemporary issues around race,\" Boggis said. \"This year, our program focuses on themes based in history but relevant to the present. Exploring these past issues gives us an opportunity to understand what brought us to where we are today. Today's solutions have to be grounded in history, in that journey taken by those who came before us.\u201d \n \nBoggis believes that this type of open discussion is important now more than ever. \n \n\u201cIn our communities, there is a need and desire for this type of conversation. Using the context of history is crucial because we can learn from our problematic past that keeps us divided; it is essential to understand how our past can affect our future. The only way to bridge the gap that divides us is through dialogue and understanding.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Anne Richter Arnold"},"topics":[],"title":"Elinor Williams Hooker Tea Talks explore past to inform the present","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203721903","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Pittsburg State\u2019s Megan Wickersham also did not clear the opening height. \n \nMSSU freshman Samantha Donnell set a provisional mark of 11-10.75 to win the open division of the pole vault. \n \nMSSU WOMEN BREAK MEDLEY MARK \n \nA Missouri Southern relay team of Morgan Smith, Destiny Akannam, Kristen Koch and Allie Heckemeyer broke the 4X400 school record with a time of 3:56.78. \n \n\u201cNone of the four ran on the relay last year,\u201d Schiding said. \u201cIn the second race, that\u2019s pretty neat for them.\u201d \n \nThe Lions finished ninth of 34 teams in the event. Pittsburg State\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 team of Rhema Taylor, Emilyn Dearman, Olivia Boone and Courtney Nelson finished third with a provisional time of 3:49.18. \n \nKIPROP beats own record \n \nIn his first action since winning the cross country national championship in November, Vincent Kiprop kicked off his indoor season with a first-place finish. \n \nKiprop, a sophomore from Kenya, won the 3K event with a time of 8:17.53, besting his school record by nearly six-tenths of a second. Junior Tyler Rush finished eighth. \n \n\u201cThe guys side showed more spark this week,\u201d Schiding said. \u201cVincent ran solid. And Tyler ran 8:38, not a bad opening time.\u201d \n \nBURNS IN ACTION \n \nBryan Burns saw his first action of the indoor season, as he was the shot put runner-up with a provisional heave of 57-06.5. \n \nA junior from Carthage, Burns finished behind Central Missouri\u2019s Jacob Mahin, who had a series best 57-07.5. \n \nThe mark, along with a fourth-place weight throw of 58-10.75, were personal bests for Burns. \n \n\u201cThis was the first time he threw this season, coming off a solid preseason,\u201d Schiding said. \u201cIt was a good opener for sure against some really good competition.\u201d \n \nAfter a first-place finish in the weight throw last week in his Lion debut, Missouri Southern\u2019s Junior Joseph took ninth with a series best toss of 55-05. Joseph, a native of Wichita, Kansas, and junior transfer from Hutchinson Community College, threw it 60-7.75 last week. \n \nNext weekend the Lions will take smaller groups to the Central Missouri Mule Relays in Warrensburg. \n \nThe women compete on Friday and the men on Saturday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Presley breaks own school record at PSU","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jasper","zipCode":"64801","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Joplin","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Joplin Globe","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672979","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3234"},"name":"Joplin Globe","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.joplinglobe.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203722318","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:22:57Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Occasionally, while waiting in check-out lines, she would be drawn to the tabloids displayed there, with their garish headlines about celebrities, perversities, conspiracies and aliens with three breasts. \n \nEmbarrassed, I'd always ask her to put it away before people saw her looking at them. True to my recently acquired adolescent sophistication, I would patiently explain what rubbish it all was. Thankfully, she never actually bought one of them! \n \n\"Why? It's in print. It must be true. They can't print something that's not true.\u201d \n \n\u201cYes, Mummy, they can.\u201d \n \nNot only did they but, alarmingly, they still do. \n \nNot only do they still but in doing so those media outlets have empowered an intellectually-deprived portion of our citizenry with the courage to act out their anger and prejudices in shameful, unpatriotic and dangerous ways. \n \nToday, one of the more dangerous manifestations of that empowerment stands before us as president. \n \nToday, those outlets, exponentially multiplied in the internet age on diverse platforms, are sustained by true believers nurtured by Fox News, Breitbart and Stormfront. They\u2019re egged on by kleptocrats and oligarchs who\u2019re profiting from the resultant polluted tide of nativism and prejudice without calling to calm the roiled waters of bigotry. \n \nThis week, according to AP, at New York\u2019s JFK Airport \u201ca Massachusetts man was accused of attacking a Muslim Delta employee Rabeeya Khan, allegedly kicking and shouting obscenities at the woman and telling her that President Donald Trump \u2018will get rid of all of you.\u2019\u201d \n \nWhen Khan ran from her attacker he followed her, got down on his knees and began to bow down, imitating a Muslim praying, shouted more obscenities and said \u201cTrump is here now. He will get rid of all of you. You can ask Germany, Belgium and France about these kind of people. You see what happens.\u201d \n \nTo American Muslims this isn\u2019t news. This is merely one of well-over 400 Islamophobic acts directed at Muslims in the past 12 months and merely reflects the fear and uncertainty many American Muslims are experiencing. \n \nThis week such fears are being amplified by a report that Trump will soon announce a cessation to issuing visas to Iranians, Iraqis, Syrians, Libyans, Somalis, Sudanese and Yemenis. \n \nThis reported executive order \u2014 a deliberate act of religious exclusion \u2014 clearly places Donald Trump within that shameful pantheon of bigots occupied by the likes of Strom Thurmond, George Wallace and David Duke. \n \nAnd it will stand as an executive order contrary to reality, especially because all the terror attacks America\u2019s endured since, and including 9/11, not one was by a citizen or refugee from the above sanctioned seven countries. \n \nFirst, the reality is that much of the terrorism and political violence experienced in America is committed by white supremacists many of whom, it appears through intelligence reports, are forming connections with European right-wing extremist groups. \n \nSecond, his executive action is flawed both in concept and execution. \n \nIn 2015 a State Department spokesperson said of the nearly 785,000 refugees admitted through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program since 9/11 that, \u201conly about a dozen \u2014 a tiny fraction of one percent of admitted refugees \u2014 have been arrested or removed from the U.S. due to terrorism concerns that existed prior to their resettlement in the U.S. None of them were Syrian.\u201d \n \nAlso, the vetting process for refugees runs from 18 to 24 months, sometimes taking a long as three years. Contrary to President Trump no one gets refugee status without documents that\u2019ve been fully vetted. \n \nWhile all seven Trump-designated countries are Muslim-majority they are not all among the world\u2019s most violent; For example, the Central African Republic, South Sudan and DR Congo are listed among the world\u2019s 10 most violent nations but are not on the list \n \nThey\u2019re not on the list, I believe, because they\u2019re not Muslim-majority. \n \nI wonder, too, about Iran\u2019s inclusion. We\u2019ve had no Iranian terrorism in America and they, like us, are targeted by ISIS. Today, America peacefully embraces between 300,000 to 400,000 Iranian-Americans \u2014 Shi\u2019a, Sunni, Baha\u2019i, Jewish, Christian. \n \nIs it about Iran\u2019s aggression toward other peoples? If so, should Saudi Arabia be listed for what they\u2019ve done in Yemen, or Russia for what its participation in genocide in Chechnya and Syria? \n \nDon\u2019t we have any moral responsibility for Syrians queuing for refugee status \u2014 victims of regional destabilization for which we share much blame? And of the over 200,000 Iraqi-Americans present today how many would even have chosen to emigrate if we hadn\u2019t illegally invaded their country? \n \nFor whom do we have responsibility? \n \nSuch bans and discrimination do not increase U.S. security. They\u2019re simply racist and are based on ignorance and bigotry, the same sort of bigotry that deem some peoples inferior to others, as has been done to Native Americans and blacks in America and to Jews, both historically through Christian literature and throughout Europe in the 1930s and '40s. \n \nToday, most Americans remain either willfully ignorant of, or indifferent to, that history and instead embrace a false myth of American Exceptionalism \u2014 which within a Trumpian context means \u201cWhite Exceptionalism.\u201d \n \nSince 9/11, many American citizens have unquestioningly fed upon a mind-numbing diet of hatred and bigotry, to them justified in the name of keeping us safe from \u201cRadical Islamic Terrorism\u201d \u2013 itself code for fear of the Other \u2013 even fear of President Barack Obama, who Trump for years tried to delegitimize. \n \nToday, Muslim and Other are code for all who are not Trump \u2014 all who march for social justice, dignity and equity. \n \nAmerica has a long history of terrorizing the vulnerable, the weak and those whom we believe are less than we. Trump, who has a knack for inflaming and exploiting America\u2019s collective dark side, sadly knows how to exploit that history. \n \nAnd it puts us at risk. \n \nIn a Ha'aretz column, Robert Bank, president of American Jewish World Service writes, \u201cAs the leader of an international Jewish organization that, for decades, has worked with Muslim organizations and Muslim partners to end poverty and advance human rights in some of the poorest countries in the world I believe it is our duty to object in the strongest terms to the demonization of all Muslims by the new American administration. We understand all too well what it means to deny safe harbor to persecuted people who are seeking refuge, and we believe we are at risk of returning to the days when the United States tragically acted with indifference to Jewish and other refugees from Europe during World War II.\u201d \n \nToday, it\u2019s not just Muslims at risk. \n \nIt is We the People \u2013 we are at risk. \n \nRobert Azzi is a photographer and writer who lives in Exeter.

He might enjoy knowing that Trump's America is snapping up translations of his homoerotically tinged work even as the country toys with banning Muslims and rolling back gay rights. \n \nRumi, like Omar Khayyam, has become the warm and fuzzy ecumenical poet of choice for weddings, coming-of-age ceremonies and funerals. A benign mist dews our lens on a golden-age Islam. Edward Said would rap our bourgeois knuckles for the way we idealize classical Persia. \n \nNow, to rescue Rumi from this inane Orientalizing comes the poet, novelist and biographer Brad Gooch with \"Rumi's Secret.\" A dazzling feat of scholarship, but a pedestrian read, the book restores Rumi to the glories and hardships of his momentous age. Gooch spent nearly eight years on the project, learning Persian and traveling to Rumi-relevant lands including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria and Turkey, co-translating the verse he quotes, steeping himself in scores of books, and interviewing Rumi luminaries and acolytes. \n \nBuilding particularly on Franklin Lewis' \"Rumi\" (2000), Gooch manages to paint an accessible, tangible portrait of the ancient poet. He makes real for us Rumi's boyhood travels from his home in the Tajik village of Vakhsh, his studies in Aleppo and Damascus, and his family and religious life in Konya, in what is now Turkey. Gooch explores Rumi's relationship not just with Shams, the older spiritual intimate with whom he became obsessed, but also \u2014 later, after Shams' suspicious disappearance \u2014 with a goldsmith, Salah, and then with Hosam, trusted longtime friend and treasurer of the informal religious order that had formed around Rumi. \n \nShams made Rumi question the expectations for his respectable and predictable future. He brought out the religious leader's budding mystic inclinations, including an unorthodox love of music and dance in which Rumi's prayers began to evolve into poetry and song. Was sex involved in the men's many cloistered hours together? \"While no evidence exists of an erotic component,\" Gooch writes, \"Rumi chose to speak of their spiritual love in the mode of Persian romantic love poetry, and from weaving the two came his evanescent message.\" In other words, who knows? \n \nRumi's masterwork, the six-volume spiritual epic \"The Masnavi,\" shivers with infinite devotion, but also infinite loss. Shams may have been murdered by one of Rumi's sons in jealous conspiracy with other apostles who felt the older mystic was undermining Rumi's calling. Or Shams may have felt driven away. Or he may have left to teach Rumi a lesson about separation. After all, he'd done that before. In any case, Shams' disappearance, absent any resolution, perhaps echoed in Rumi's mind other losses such as the death of his father and the destruction of his boyhood homes by the Mongol armies of the Khans, whose authority increasingly encroached on Konya as well. \n \nThe book's title, \"Rumi's Secret,\" is more a tease than a biographical agenda. For if you consider the secret the nature of Rumi's intimacy with Shams or the perpetual mystery underlying great poetic talent, then Rumi's secret rests securely with him in his tomb. Then again, the poet's secret might be no secret at all. Fasting, whirling, dancing and reciting while Hosam acted as scribe, Rumi, like mystics before and since, may have looked increasingly inward as the outward showed signs of toppling all around him. Worn down to his physical, spiritual and elegiac essence, he turned his back on worldly factions and reached out to Christians and Jews, tradesmen and lepers. At the risk of heresy, he found direct connection to God, to Mohammed and to the Koran, to which he brazenly considered his \"Masnavi\" a complement. \n \n\"Rumi's Secret\" is a strangely dry read considering it has a literally whirling mystic as its subject. As if fearing that too lyrical an approach to such an orphic figure would result in incoherence, Gooch describes this poet's life in a decidedly unpoetic way. He offers conscientious chronology: who traveled where, studied with whom, won which royals as patrons, and so on. And he gives us some helpful exegesis, for instance, in explaining a surrealistic dream passage by Rumi drawing on a 40-day period of bread-and-water subsistence in total isolation. But this book won't get anyone excited about Rumi. Instead, it will give those already excited about Rumi help in contextualizing his work. \n \nLook at what has become of Aleppo and Damascus, the centers of learning of Rumi's young manhood. Look at today's tatters of his ecumenical outreach. What power compels millions nonetheless to seek out his healing verses? One wishes that Gooch, for all the years he put into understanding Rumi, would offer, beyond quotes from a few Rumi scholars and enthusiasts, some deeper speculation along these lines. \n \nGooch does equip us to make some guesses of our own. Perhaps in a world of warlords, sects and terror, the enduring appeal is the immediate spiritual self-determination that Rumi promises: \n \nOh brother, you are nothing but your thoughts \n \nThe rest of you is merely skin and bones \n \nIf your thought is a rose, you are a rose garden \n \nIf your thought is a thorn, you are fuel for the fire. \n \nOr do we see ourselves reflected in Rumi's melancholic ambiguities? \"The religion of love,\" he asserts, \"is beyond all faiths.\" With the Middle East again aflame, the West in another bitter parochial crouch, one wonders, does that mean that supreme love is accessible to all of us, or to none? \n \nAlexander C.

Full details are at www.newmarketschoolprojects.com. \n \nEfforts to modernize the high school date back a dozen years, and past failed efforts led to this plan, an honest, reasonable investment that takes into account the town\u2019s economic diversity. The $39 million plan is integrated to provide shared spaces such as a cafetorium in the high school and new gymnasium in the elementary school that are available for all district students. \n \nA homeowner with a house assessed at $250,000 would pay an additional $788 per year, or $66 a month. That is a considerable amount, but it\u2019s less than the previous plan, which only dealt with the high school, and it\u2019s likely to be less than any future plan should this one not be approved, especially as construction costs and interest rates rise. It is also less of a financial impact given the town\u2019s increased property tax base since 2014, which on April 1 will include the full taxable base of the redeveloped mills as it received a tax deferral as part of its redevelopment. \n \nIt is regretful that the New Hampshire Legislature has thus far failed to reinstate school building aid. Should lawmakers do the right thing this plan is designed to be eligible for some level reimbursement. \n \nSchool leaders respected that a town with the economic diversity of Newmarket cannot pass a wish-list plan. A cafetorium, which is a cafeteria with a stage and appropriate acoustics to provide a performance venue, instead of a much more costly auditorium, is a perfect example of the pragmatic design. No one can tell all residents they should vote for this plan if they have limited income, but the committee did consider all with a need-based plan. \n \nModernizing both schools will help increase property values. In time, while building upon Newmarket\u2019s renaissance, especially its vibrant downtown, property values will equalize with surrounding towns. This pragmatic modernization will limit the tax increase to what is truly necessary and that will also help increase property values. \n \nThere will be debate about the $39 million cost, which has been referred to as the elephant in the room, but most of 2014\u2019s divisiveness will be absent because it\u2019s not as hard to sell the merits of this plan. \n \nSome will ask how an early estimate of a $15 million to $18 million renovation of the junior-senior high school rose to $28.4 million. School officials say that estimate didn\u2019t create a real plan that provides a 50-year upgrade to the high school. This plan is not another Band-Aid, the collection of which has already cost residents millions of dollars. The high school plan will create 50,501 square feet for a total of 128,134 square feet. It preserves the original 1924 building and there is value in saving this piece of town history and culture. \n \nRenovation/expansion plans are common at Seacoast schools, including Portsmouth\u2019s high and middle schools, Winnacunnet High and Oyster River High. Those projects proved to be cost-effective and efficient. \n \nThe 2014 $45 million plan didn\u2019t address the elementary school while nearly maxing out the school\u2019s legal bonding capacity. This plan will modernize the elementary school, which now uses modular classrooms and doesn\u2019t have appropriate cafeteria or gym space. Recent approval of full-day kindergarten further adds to the need for reinvestment in the school. \n \nIt\u2019s been a long road, but this plan is worthy of approval.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Newmarket school plan worthy of approval","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203724161","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

New! New! - New Restaurants, New dishes, New meals, New Flavors. This Month\u2019s theme puts the word NEW on a whole new level. \n \nBlind Pig, in Kittery, is plowing its way through the winter season. They first opened their doors with a gastro pub menu and now almost two years later they are beginning to evolve. \n \n\u201cWe are slowly morphing the theme of the restaurant into BBQ, specifically upscale BBQ. The trend is \u2018back to basics\u2019 with clean, simple, fresh and well thought-out dishes. We are steering away from overcomplicated foods,\u201d shares chef Michael Prete, going on to add, \u201cWe already do our own butchering and now we\u2019ll be smoking meats more. This brisket dish itself will morph into a rubbed and smoked product come spring, but currently we are braising it for more of a hearty winter-style dish.\u201d \n \nThe addition of more BBQ isn\u2019t the only new addition at Blind Pig. Looking to the future, days filled with sun and warm breezes, Blind Pig will be breaking out the teeny, tiny hammers. \n \n\u201cThis summer we\u2019ll have crab and crawfish tables for our patrons. With a hole in the middle you can crack some crabs and drink some beer. We\u2019ll also have music outside,\u201d Prete says. \n \nIn addition, everything on the new menu will be available in their new provision section. \n \n\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to buy everything we make by the pound. We will be making our own bacon, pulled pork by the pound, ketchup, BBQ sauces, hot sauces and more,\u201d Prete adds. \n \nBraised Brisket, Sweet Pepper Glaze with Butter Smashed Fingerlings and Crispy Haricot Vert \n \nBrisket instructions, according to Prete \n \nFirst the brisket gets lightly trimmed of the deeper fat spots, seasoned and grill seared on all sides, then goes into a braising pan with a briny bath of BBQ-esque liquids. (Ketchup, Worcestershire, molasses, vinegar, seasonings, etc.) Covered tight and into a 300 degree oven for at least 5 hours. Then into the fridge to chill. \n \nSweet Pepper Glaze \n \nA combination of local sweet and hot peppers, sugar, corn starch, seasoning and cooked down to a nice glaze and then finished off with some finishing sherry vinegar and honey. \n \nGreen Bean Frits \n \nWe use Haricot Verts, a French-style green bean, lightly blanched, we toss them in buttermilk, then into a dry coating of corn meal, corn starch, flour with seasoning and herbs, then fried crispy. \n \nSmashed Fingerlings \n \nBlanch the fingerling potatoes and to order, hand crush them into a pan with butter, roasted garlic paste, shallots and mixed herbs. \n \nTo assemble: \n \nWe sear the sides of the portioned brisket and then into a 450 degree oven until hot. We place our potatoes on the bottom of the plate as a nest, the brisket goes on top, the glaze gets drizzled over part of the brisket and it's finished off with the crispy green beans. Easy, delicious. \n \n The Dish is a weekly series about local chefs and bakers and their favorite recipes based on a monthly theme. This month's theme is New! New!

Regarding the MLK Jr. holiday, I am panicked that my mind may be playing tricks on me. After reading \u201cAsk Jerry\u201d for many years, I am optimistic you will settle my concern. Here is the issue.  \n \nEarlier this month, my new senior-citizen neighbors and I were watching the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday observances. There was a fair amount of coverage on television. It mentioned that MLK Jr. Day did not become a holiday until 1983. Unless my mind is totally disappearing from reality, I have a clear recollection that we celebrated Martin Luther King, Jr. Day during the mid-1970s.  \n \nAm I totally losing my memory?  \n \n\u2014 Mary T., Dubuque, Iowa  \n \nDear Mary:  \n \nYour memory sounds excellent to me. When you lived in Galena, Illinois, you happen to reside in the first state to observe Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as an official holiday. It was 1973 when Illinois adopted it as a state holiday.  \n \nFour days after the assassination of The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. (1968), legislation was introduced to make MLK Jr. Day a federal holiday. However, it took 15 years before legislation was passed (1983). Then, it was another three years before the legislation and MLK Jr. Day were in effect (1986).  \n \nThe holiday was not observed immediately in all 50 states though DC, like Illinois, observed it officially before it became a national holiday. Following a tourist boycott, Arizona approved the holiday in 1992. New Hampshire, the last state to acknowledge Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in its own right, did not adopt the holiday until 1999. It was 13 years after it became a federal holiday that New Hampshire actually changed the name of its Civil Rights Day to Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Obviously, this holiday did not happen instantly across the United States.  \n \nEven today, there are three southern states that combine Martin Luther King, Jr. Day with Robert E. Lee Day. Those are Alabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi. Albeit controversial, that one-stop holiday still exists in those states.  \n \nIn fact, many variations have occurred throughout the country and over the years. For example, the Commonwealth of Virginia merged the commemoration of Robert E. Lee, Thomas J. (\u201cStonewall\u201d) Jackson, and Martin Luther King, Jr. into one holiday. Although the Lee and Jackson portion were subsequently separated from the King portion, Lee-Jackson-King Day was observed annually in Virginia from 1984 through 2000.  \n \nWhile hardly a comprehensive history, that would be a CliffsNotes version of the MLK Jr. holiday. Meanwhile, Mary, I am impressed that you recall events so specifically from the mid-1970s. Congratulations.  \n \nJerry Romansky is a syndicated columnist.

This is a good thing. \n \nThis new government should aim to act boldly and quickly. \n \nFor conservatives, there are also smaller but significant issues \u2014 points of unfinished business, some dating back as far as President Reagan \u2014 that should be completed. \n \nHere are five, all of which are doable. \n \nFirst, repeal Davis-Bacon. This law, which was enacted in 1931 and purports to ensure that workers on public projects are paid the prevailing local wage, was in fact a pay-off to Big Labor for its support of the Democratic Party. It costs taxpayers dearly. \n \nBy inflating labor costs, Davis-Bacon inflates overall construction costs for the federal government. If the Trump administration and Congress are going to do an infrastructure bill to push the economy forward, repealing Davis-Bacon would increase its impact. \n \nRepeal would also make the point that taxpayers should not be footing the bill to pay off special interests such as trade unions. Repeal of Davis-Bacon could be included in a reconciliation bill. \n \nSecond, pass medical malpractice tort reform. Just as President Trump and Congress look to replace ObamaCare by delivering better care at a lower cost, fixing the legal system around healthcare should be a no-brainer. This reform can and should move quickly and early. \n \nThe Congress could even follow a template set out by the state of California a generation ago. It would mean that doctors and hospitals would not have to constantly order unnecessary tests and procedures just to protect themselves from scurrilous lawyers. \n \nThey could actually practice quality medicine instead of defensive medicine. Costs would go down and patients would receive the care they need, not the care dictated by fear of inappropriate lawsuits. \n \nThird, take back Congress\u2019s constitutional responsibility to control the funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and make it answerable to elected government. \n \nThe manner in which the CFPB was set up was an obscene relinquishment of Congress\u2019s obligation to govern. The CFPB is the only federal agency which essentially answers to no-one. It is funded totally independently of the Congress and it has no oversight. It is a rogue agency. \n \nThe CFPB needs to be reined in before it does real damage. At a minimum, its funding should be subject to review and its leadership answerable to lawmakers. These changes could also be done through reconciliation. \n \nSince the early days of the Reagan presidency, right up to the present, National Public Radio (NPR) has been the voice of the left. It pursues an unending and vicious editorial policy that attacks conservatives and Republicans. It is incomprehensible that dollars raised through taxes from conservative and moderate Americans should be used to subsidize NPR\u2019s extreme liberal agenda. \n \nNPR has the right to say and report whatever it wishes, but it should not have its efforts paid for by American taxpayers. Any funding that goes to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting should be fenced so it cannot be used to underwrite NPR. This approach should have been taken years ago. It should be structured as a cut in spending and put in reconciliation. \n \nFifth, reform the civil service so that the large number of people who work for the government and are not doing anything but sitting at desks can be dropped from the taxpayers\u2019 expense account. \n \nOnce again, reconciliation could be used \u2014 in this instance, to direct a ten percent reduction in the workforces of all federal agencies, with the exception of the Department of Defense. \n \nA system-wide cut in personnel, using attrition and allowing termination for non-performance, is the only way to get real action. The 19th century Pendleton Act was supposed to protect the federal workforce from direct political cronyism. But instead, the culture has become one of liberal-agenda cronyism. \n \nThe federal workforce needs a major do-over, but a marginal downsizing of about 10 percent is at least a good place to start. This also can be done in reconciliation. \n \nThis Congress has the opportunity to do a great deal. Much of it can and needs to be accomplished by aggressively using reconciliation. \n \nThese are Five Easy Pieces, which would allow this new government to help put together the puzzle that will produce a better government. \n \nJudd Gregg of Rye is a former governor and three-term senator from New Hampshire who served as chairman and ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, and as ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Foreign Operations subcommittee.

The impact on victims can be measured, not in traumatized days and months, but in years and decades. The psychological impacts are multiplied by difficulties encountered keeping jobs and maintaining relationships. Often memories of such horrific assaults only surface years later, after countless hours of therapy and support. \n \nWe have also learned that rapes and sexual assaults are less likely to be perpetrated by strangers preying on strangers. It is much more likely, we now know, to be perpetrated by a family member in familiar surroundings or by a colleague in the workplace. \n \nAnd while rape remains egregiously underreported, we now know that efforts in recent decades to encourage reporting have brought more cases to the attention of the courts without the recriminations that were so often present in the past. As we have begun to take the impacts of sexual assault on victims and their families much more seriously, we are also seeing that the way police, prosecutors, court personnel, and medical professionals interact with victims of rape and sexual assault has been changing as well. \n \nOne thing that has not changed, however, is one of the most important threshold questions asked when someone comes forward: When did the attack take place? In New Hampshire, if a victim answers with any date before Jan. 29, 2011, the reporting officer might just as well stop writing, crumple up the form they were filling out and aim for the recycling bin. There is nothing that that officer or any prosecutor or judge in the state can do in such a situation. Because the alleged crime was committed over six years ago, no case can ever be brought against the accused perpetrator, thanks to our current statute of limitations. This law must be changed. That is why this year I have filed legislation (SB 98) to end New Hampshire's harmful and arbitrary six year statute of limitations for sexual assault claims. \n \nStatutes of limitations serve a purpose in property crimes. No one thinks that police should spend years tracking down a stolen car or investigating an act of vandalism. People file an insurance claim, purchase a new vehicle, and move on with their lives. Statutes of limitations also stop prosecutors from holding charges over a suspect\u2019s head for years without proof. There are hundreds of classes of criminal cases that don\u2019t merit remaining prosecutable for an indefinite period. Sexual assault and rape is not one of them. \n \nNationwide attention to the arbitrary nature of short statutes of limitations has recently received much greater public attention. Most notably, in the last year, as a result of claims leveled against Bill Cosby for rape and sexual assault going back forty years. A number of Cosby\u2019s alleged victims have come forward, in the wake of others speaking out, only to find themselves without legal recourse against the comedian due to such statutes of limitations. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, only two in 100 rapists will be convicted of a felony and spend any time in prison. The other 98 percent will never be punished for their crime. (Felony Defendants in Large Urban Counties, Dept. of Justice publications, 2009) \n \nCalifornia, undoubtedly in response to the Cosby case, has just recently joined a number of other states in seeking to remedy this egregious situation by passing legislation ending such statutes of limitations without opposition. It is time for New Hampshire to reform its laws as well. \n \nOnce armed with the ability to bring such cases long after the six-year limit, I am confident that prosecutors in our state will be able to put more rapists behind bars and stop sexual offenders, who are routinely discovered to be serial offenders, before they can reoffend. This means fewer rapes, fewer women \u2013 and men \u2013 being victimized, and fewer New Hampshire lives shattered by sexual violence. \n \nFor those wishing to support this effort, SB 98 and SB164 (companion legislation covering sexual crimes against minors) will have a hearing before the Judiciary Committee next Tuesday, January 31 at 9 a.m. in Senate Hearing Room 103 in the State House. The Judiciary Committee can also be reached at 271-3092. \n \nMartha Fuller Clark represents her hometown of Portsmouth as well as Durham, Lee, Madbury, Newfields, Newington, and Newmarket in the New Hampshire State Senate.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Martha Fuller Clark"},"topics":[{"name":"Crime and punishment news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Remove the statute of limitations on sex crimes","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203725148","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Playing and working with such folks as Daniel Johnston, Rachael Davis, Wooden Eye, his wife Dawn Boyer (and Rock My Soul) as well as sharing the stage with Ellis Paul, Mary Lou Lord, Teddy Thompson, Eddie from Ohio, Susan Werner, Garnet Rogers, Girlyman, Kris Delmhorst, Mark Erelli and Josh Ritter, it\u2019s not as if he hasn\u2019t found some cherished musical moments from his side of the bandstand. In light of dire personal challenge, Brett released what amounts to his debut record, \u201cFrame from a Bad Movie,\u201d in June of 2016 \u2013 a collection of his own original material. \n \nOn Jan. 7, 2011, Hartenbach was diagnosed with a grade III anaplastic astrocytoma brain tumor. He has fought valiantly for the past six years, but is now in a palliative-care-to-hospice program. The following is an interview that he graciously accepted to do. It is a conversation about his latest album. It is a conversation about leading a musical existence. It is, inherently, a conversation about life, and of making the most of your time. It is a conversation about believing in yourself and allowing yourself the opportunity to give a little something for the world to hold onto. And finally, it\u2019s a conversation about calling a tie between the Beach Boys and the Clash. \n \nSeacoast Sunday: Let\u2019s start by chatting about the latest record (which for all intents and purposes is your \u201cdebut\u201d), \u201cFrame From a Bad Movie.\u201d It\u2019s been years in the making and ultimately has a bit of a sad story behind it. I\u2019ve never been in the position of having to ask someone a question like this (so I\u2019m still going to tread very lightly), but, what was it like putting this album together as a \u201c\u2019bucket list\u201d type of entity knowing what you knew when you began to really push this thing across the finish line? \n \nHartenbach: It was a relief to finally be able to finish it. I also experienced a deep sense of accomplishment and satisfaction because it\u2019s an album I\u2019m very proud of. My wife, Dawn Boyer, asked me what top three things I\u2019d want to do while I had time, and this was the first on the list. Making a trip to Paris and playing as many good gigs as possible followed. She, with the help of many friends, made all three happen. In the case of the album, she contacted Joe Rogers, a great friend, who was enthusiastic about helping to engineer and produce some recordings I\u2019d made many years earlier as well as to add final touches on songs that needed them. Joe and I spent about a year working together, and I enjoyed every moment. I had worked with Chris Magruder of Thundering Sky and Jeff Landrock of Landrock Recording a few years back as well, but the bulk of the recording was done at one home or another between here and Michigan.  \n \nI really didn\u2019t have any bittersweet feelings about it. I\u2019d been wanting to make this album for more than 30 years, and it\u2019s gratifying to know I can now offer it to the world, leave a little something of me and my music behind. \n \nSS: You\u2019re a lifelong writer. Is the act of putting pen to paper an easy or arduous task when you put on the \u201csongwriting\u201d hat? Do you look at your tunes like you would another songwriter\u2019s tunes when you\u2019ve got your \u201ccritic\u201d hat on? That\u2019s an interesting dynamic. \n \nHartenbach: Anyone who knows me would laugh and immediately say it\u2019s an arduous task. I\u2019m probably the harshest critic about my work than anyone else could ever be. It\u2019s a blessing and a curse; it keeps me sharp, but it can also do my work in. I do look at my tunes the way I\u2019d look at another artist\u2019s \u2014 I wrote as a music critic for All Music Guide for many years, and I learned a lot from Robert Christgau as well \u2014 actually, maybe I look at my tunes in a more critical light than I do with others, now that I think of it. \n \nSS: Music. What is it good for? Why have you spent your life seeking it? Why have you spent your life creating it? \n \nHartenbach: Okay, so now I can\u2019t get Edwin Starr out of my head. Music is good for entertainment, sure, but in my case, music has been, and is, a lifeline, the core of who I am. It\u2019s a lens through which I view the world. People have joked that I\u2019m a walking music encyclopedia or a music geek, but it goes much deeper than that. It\u2019s a reason to be, a way to make life meaningful, if that makes any sense. And practically speaking, it\u2019s been a way to make a pretty decent living. I feel fortunate for that. \n \nSS: What do you hope people take with them when they experience \u201cFrame From a Bad Movie\u201d? \n \nHartenbach: That it\u2019s a completely immersive experience, the way albums used to be. That when you begin listening to the first song, you\u2019re on a journey that makes sense all along the way until the end, when you feel you wound up where you needed to or should have with the musical thread that weaves through. I hope people can feel the joy and satisfaction I got when making it. I want people to engage and think and feel on a deeper level than they would with many other records out there. I hope these songs invite them to do that. \n \nSS: Looking back, are there things you might have done differently in regard to your musical career? What advice might you offer to someone just starting out? \n \nHartenbach: With all the technical tools out there now, I would have told myself to make many more albums before it was too late. They\u2019d have to be of high quality, though. Just because you have the tools doesn\u2019t automatically mean the album or the songs are going to be stellar. That takes time, experience, lots of mistakes, and a lot of work. \n \nI would have also believed in myself more. Self-doubt is a terrible hindrance, and it definitely held me back more than I want to admit. I would have liked to have been more confident and assertive about introducing my songs to audiences and to others in the business. I\u2019ve had a great career as an acoustic guitarist \u2014 some have referred to me more than once as \u201cthe other guy\u201d when I\u2019ve accompanied some fine singers and musicians \u2014 and although I wouldn\u2019t trade any of those experiences because I count myself lucky to have had them, I do wish I\u2019d been more forthcoming about my own music. I found that, at times, certain people wouldn\u2019t respond to it the way they would to songs that were less demanding, and that made me doubt my vision and talent. I wish I\u2019d seen that it was more an issue of many listeners not knowing how to engage with material that required more of them than simply listening to a tune that\u2019s easy to sing along with or dance to. Language, rhythm, picking patterns, unusual chord progressions, the different sonic layers it takes to convey the right shades of meaning, the emotional message behind a song \u2014 all those are important to me. \n \nMy advice to someone starting out would be to record any ideas that you have and not worry about how strange they might be. That strangeness is what makes you an artist and gives you a voice different from the millions out there. Also, if you\u2019re stuck on something, don\u2019t keep working on it, because you can kill it. Leave it until later. Find people in your life who believe in you, too, because the business side can be tough, and we all need support to get us through. A strange combination of stubbornness and being a nice person are also important. You don\u2019t want to compromise your vision, but no one wants to work with an egotistical jerk. Many times, others have great ideas you might not have thought of on your own.  \n \nSS: You grew up in Ohio and came to Portsmouth in 2003 from Michigan, where you moved when you were in your twenties. What brought you to the Portsmouth area? What kept you sticking around all these years? \n \nHartenbach: My wife brought me to Portsmouth. She lived in the area, and I wanted to be with her and marry her. So I moved, and I did marry her, and I never looked back. Marriage kept me sticking around, and so did the community of musicians I began to find myself part of. I\u2019ve played with many different people across the U.S. and the world, but I\u2019ve made deep friendships here, both musical and personal, that I treasure. In fact, Dawn once asked me if we might move to Nashville or Austin before we got too old, and I told her I didn\u2019t want to leave this community. It means too much to me. \n \nSS: I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of highlights that you look back on, but, for me, I was really touched by the record, \u201cEverything's OK ... If You Look at It That Way,\u201d which was a batch of your tunes performed by your peers and culminated with a monumental show (which featured one of your collaborators, Daniel Johnston) at the Rochester Opera House about five years ago. I mean, that was a special record. What was your first reaction to it when you first took it for a spin? \n \nHartenbach: I felt pride, humility, a sense of being blown away about what everyone had done \u2014 it was incredible to hear how others interpreted my music. All those different shades of meaning and color that I might not have thought of or given a tune \u2013 I loved hearing how some people took them to completely different places. I still play them over and over in order to learn from them. \n \nSS: Looking back on a lifetime of music, what are five tunes that have stuck with you the entire way? \n \nHartenbach: \n \n\u201cBus Stop\u201d by The Hollies (it can be thought of as my fundamental driving force) \n \n\u201cLate for the Sky\u201d by Jackson Browne \n \n\u201cJust One Smile\u201d by Dusty Springfield \n \n\u201cPenny Lane\u201d by The Beatles \n \n\u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow,\" Judy Garland\u2019s version, because there really isn\u2019t any other that compares. \n \nI want to list my top five albums, too, if that\u2019s okay, because I love how the great albums are almost like novels comprised of song. You hear the story running through, and you\u2019re changed. \n \n\u201cShoot Out the Lights\u201d by Richard and Linda Thompson \n \n\u201cGrievous Angel\u201d by Gram Parsons \n \n\u201cHighway 61 Revisited\u201d by Bob Dylan \n \n\u201cDusty in Memphis\u201d by Dusty Springfield \n \n\u201cPet Sounds\u201d by the Beach Boys, tied with \u201cLondon Calling\u201d by The Clash \n \nSS: With respect, what\u2019s one question that you wish a journalist would ask you that hasn\u2019t happened yet? \n \nHartenbach: What are some of your favorite musical memories? \n \nSS: What\u2019s the answer to that question? \n \nHartenbach: Standing on stage and turning to see Taj Mahal singing right behind me while playing at one festival. That was a thrill. Jim Lauderdale telling me he enjoyed my playing during a round  \u2014 another thrill for sure. Getting to meet Richard Thompson, a musical hero of mine, at a Passim benefit at the Sanders Theatre in Boston. I got tongue-tied. He\u2019s such a nice guy, but shy the way I am, and we both kind of stood and grinned at each other, and I had no idea what to say. Meeting and talking with Jeff Daniels at the Michigan Theatre. Playing the Newport Folk Festival with Mary Lou Lord and Rachael Davis. Playing with Dawn and Rock My Soul \u2014 it\u2019s a gem of a group, and the musicians are among the best I\u2019ve worked with, not just in this area, but in general. I\u2019ve had the most fun with them over the years. And finally, playing with Dan Johnston \u2014 so many great moments and stories there. He gave me the chance to perform around the world with him, and I\u2019ll forever be grateful to him for that. The Union Chapel in London was an all-time favorite venue for me, and so were the Black Cab sessions we got to do together there. I\u2019ve met so many great people along the way, established so many long-lasting and deep friendships through music, and I count myself a lucky man.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Christopher Hislop"},"topics":[],"title":"A life surrounded by music","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203726645","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:23:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In fact, it was just the opposite. \n \n\u201cI am extremely proud of this team\u2019s resolve, commitment and work ethic,\u201d Kinney said. \u201cTheir hard work is going to pay off as we press forward looking towards the league and state meets at the end of the season. Overall, we have a young team but have received outstanding leadership from the seniors.\u201d \n \nOne of the biggest highlights of the meet for the Wildcats was senior Nick Gorham throwing a monster personal best throw of 44\u201911\u201d to take the shot put. \n \nWilmington also got a big win in the 1,000 meters where senior Ray Russell took first place in a time of 2:44.85, while fellow senior Jason Dunn followed close behind in a time of 2:51.36. \n \nOther top performances for the Wildcats came from sophomore Kevin Elderd, who ran a personal best of 5:06 to take second in the mile, along with fellow sophomore Ben Packer, who took second in the two mile in a time of 11:06.62. Senior Ryan Aldrich, meanwhile, took second place in the 600 meters in a time of 1:32.40. \n \nThe Wildcats best event of the day was the 300 meters, where they swept the top three spots behind the efforts of juniors Sean Braz (40.25) and Tom Hogan (40.42), along with sophomore Joe Dumolin (40.93). \n \nSenior Dave Bell had an outstanding day, grabbing a third place finish in the 55 meter dash in a time of 7.11, while also helping to lead the Wildcats to a win in the 4x400 relay, running the first leg in 57.5 seconds. Bell was joined in winning the 4x400 by Sean Braz, Ryan Aldrich and Ray Russell. \n \nIn the high jump, sophomore Jordan Olatilu took second place with a top mark of 5\u201905\u201d, while Dumolin placed third at 5\u201903\u201d. Sophomore Sam Vince meanwhile, ran a personal best 9.99 to take second in the 55 meter hurdles. \n \nFollowing the loss to Stoneham, the Wildcats continued their season at the State Relay Meet at the Reggie Lewis Center on Sunday, January 15, with several Wildcats once again giving great efforts. \n \nThe best of the bunch on the day for the Wildcats was the 4x800 relay team of seniors Justin Eckstrom, Jason Dunn, DJ Kenney and Ray Russell who finished in a personal best, state qualifying time of 8:46.04. \n \nOther state qualifiers on the season thus far for the Wildcats have been Ray Russell in 1,000 meters, Nick Gorham in the shot put and the 4 x 400 relay team of Dave Bell, Sean Braz, Ryan Aldrich and Ray Russell. \n \nThe Wildcats faced Burlington on Wednesday in the team\u2019s final regular season meet with results not known as of presstime.

Such is the case with Trump\u2019s latest Mexico tariff proposal. \n \nI have no doubt Trump floated the idea without much thought, maybe as part of a pending negotiation between the two countries. I also have no doubt this article might be dated before we go to print, but the mere fact Trump suggested the tariff needs to be addressed. Whatever the reason, it is an absolutely stupid idea. \n \nTariffs come in many forms and some are sound in their conception. One example of a tariff might be a fee applied to all ships that \u201cdock\u201d at a port. This type of tariff is common and is comparable to a parking fee you and I might be charged when we park downtown. However, a tariff can only be as high, and fair, as the market is willing to bear. None of you would park in downtown Portsmouth or Dover if the parking was $20 an hour, which would have an adverse effect on a city\u2019s economy (fewer customers means fewer employees, which means fewer goods purchased, etc.). Likewise, a ship would not dock if the cost to do so was disproportionate to the goods or service. Economics 101 has many tenets, one being that the profit ratio has to be within a margin a customer feels is just, while at the same time the merchant knows they are being fairly compensated. \n \nThen there are more punitive types of tariffs, the ones designed to punish, to reduce the flow of goods, that have an adverse effect on a country\u2019s internal commerce, or to protect businesses in our country that also happen to offer the same goods. It is these types of tariffs that seldom benefit the entirety of a nation\u2019s economy. The \u201cTariff of 1828\u201d and \u201cSmoot-Hawley Tariff Act\u201d of the 1930s are two examples. \n \nAlthough slightly different in conception, both had a negative effect on parts or all of our economy.  The Tariff of 1828, which would become known as the Tariff of Abominations, only benefited the economy of the North, in particular New England. The Smoot-Hawley tariff had a devastating effect on our economy, not at first, but as other countries countered with their own tariffs, our economic woes worsened. The Smoot-Hawley tariff came when the U.S. economy was on the brink of total collapse, and served to aggravate the Great Depression. \n \nAlthough Trump\u2019s tariff probably would not be to the extremes of either of these two tariffs, there will be negative consequences. One only needs to follow the flow of agricultural goods between Mexico and the United States to understand the consequences. \n \nThe United States exports approximately $19 billion in agriculture to Mexico. Mexico is the third largest U.S. agricultural export market. Mexico exports approximately $18 billion worth of agricultural goods to the United States. The Trump Tariff would attach a 20 percent fee on all those goods coming to the United States. A tomato or avocado from Mexico would increase in price, compounded at every point of sale. Now, history tells us Mexico would almost certainly apply a similar tariff on our goods coming into their country. That is how a tariff war starts. \n \nThat U.S. farmer that exports pork to Mexico sees a reduction in orders because the cost is more than the market will bear. That pork farmer needs to adjust his model, which includes fewer workers, less need to transport goods, a reduction in grain purchases to feed his livestock and so on. A tariff of any percentage would have a devastating effect to our country, especially to an economy that only grew 1.6 percent over this past year (U.S. economic growth in 2016).  \n \nPresident Trump promised to build a wall between Mexico and the United States. Trump additionally promised Mexico would pay for that wall. I happen to believe in a physical barrier between Mexico and the United States. Mexico is a country in crisis with serious internal security issues. This border in particular is extremely vulnerable to the point that those wishing to do this country harm exploit the Mexico-U.S. border. However, a physical barrier can only be one part of an effective security strategy. In the end, it is the responsibility of the United States to provide for its own security needs. \n \nMake no mistake; Americans will pay for this wall, directly or through increased cost due to a tariff war. This tariff will hurt the U.S. and Mexican economies. Hopefully, I am correct about Trump coming to his senses on this tariff. If not, Congress should not support this economic lunacy, and a more commonsense approach to funding our southern border security needs should be presented, discussed and supported. If not, everyday Americans will pay a steep price. \n \nJeff Chidester was raised in Portsmouth and is a lifelong resident of New Hampshire.

If blind people do dream, what do they dream about? Can they see in their dreams? How else do their dream experiences differ from sighted people? A great deal of information is known about the dreams of blind people, and you may be surprised to learn about the nature of blind people\u2019s dreams. \n The Dreams of Blind People  \nFirst, blind people do dream. \n \nDream sleep is often associated with the sleep stage called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. It is generated deep within the brain. As it is a function of the brain, and not the eyes, blind people dream as much as a sighted person would. No matter the cause of the blindness, this remains true. It is interesting that the timing of the blindness in life may in fact impact the content of the dreams, however. \n What Do Blind People Dream About?  \nWhen most people think about dreams they recognize the intense visual imagery that creates the dreamscape. For many, it is like watching and participating in a movie that plays in your head. There may be other elements to the experience, including sounds, touch, taste, smells, movements, and even fear. Nevertheless, the visual experience has a central role. Dreams may be in color or in black and white. As a result, it is natural to wonder if blind people are able to see in their dreams. \n \nResearch has evaluated the sensory experiences of blind people while dreaming for decades. These findings have been interpreted within the context of sighted people\u2019s experience of dreams. It is useful to consider the content of all dreams to better understand where it differs among the blind. \n \nMost dreams contain features that are both visual and kinesthetic (related to movement, such as falling). \n \nMore than half of dreams contain an auditory element (related to sound). It is rare for people to describe other sensory experiences, such as those related to smell (olfactory), taste (gustatory), and pain. It is estimated that these latter three elements occur in less than 1 percent of dream reports. Interestingly, women more often experience smell and taste in their dreams while men more often report sound and pain. \n \nBlind people are more likely to report feelings of touch, taste, and smell in their dreams compared to sighted people. This likely corresponds to their waking experience which relies more on these senses. They do not have dramatic differences in dream content, except that they seem to have less aggression in their dreams. \n Can Blind People See in Their Dreams?  \nDespite these subtle differences in dream content, can blind people see when they dream? Some blind people actually can see in dreams, but it depends on when they lost their vision. \n \nIndividuals who are born blind, or those who become blind at a young age (typically by the age of 4 or 5 years) do not have visual imagery in their dreams. \n \nThis is supported by careful laboratory studies that documented dreaming without associated reports of visual experiences. \n \nOn the other hand, those who become blind after 5 or 6 years of age are able to see in their dreams. Therefore, there seems to be a window in the development of the brain in which the capacity to have visual dreams is established. If visual input is present, the person is able to generate sight within dreams, even after vision is lost. For those who cannot see from a young age, dreaming still occurs but other sensory input may be more prominent in their experience of these dreams. \n \nAside from unique dream content, some blind people cannot perceive light and they may be subject to a unique sleep disorder called a nonentrained circadian rhythm . This may lead to symptoms of insomnia and daytime sleepiness that is cyclical, experienced in a pattern that unfolds over weeks. This condition may be improved with the use of melatonin and a prescription medication called tasimelteon (sold as  Hetlioz ). \n \nSources: \n \nBerger, R et al . \"The EEG, eye movements, and dreams of the blind.\" Q J Exp Psychol 1962;14:183-186. \n \nKerr, N et al . \"The structure of laboratory dream reports in blind and sighted subjects.\" J Nerv Ment Dis 1982;170:286-294. \n \nKryger, MH et al . \"Principles and Practice of Sleep Medicine.\" ExpertConsult , 5th edition, 2011, p. 591. \n \nZadra, AL et al . \"Prevalence of auditory, olfactory and gustatory experiences in home dreams.\" Percept Mot Skills 1998;87:819-826.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Do Blind People Dream?

He told them \"attitude is all important\" for the seven-week tour. \n SHARE  Share on Facebook  SHARE  Share on Twitter  TWEET  Pin to Pinterest  PIN  Link   Rare occurrence: The Australians celebrate their series win in India in 2004.  Photo:   \n\"I was very much a follower and believer of most things Steve Waugh was talking to us about. I took that very much on board and tried to do that as much as possible, still do now. I find it a fascinating country,\" Gilchrist, who has business interests in India, told Fairfax Media. \n \n\"It's a country that weighs you down, too. You have highs and lows, it's an emotional roller-coaster, on the field and off the field. \n \n   \n\"You've got to find a way to escape from it \u2013 if it's in your hotel room, but you don't want to become a prisoner to your hotel room, you have to get out there. \n \n\"It's [attitude] going to be a huge percentage of what's required. The ingredients to success is a positive attitude, not just positive like you have to use your feet and go after the spinner but everything.\" \n \nGilchrist said Waugh, in a bid to keep morale high, told the players at the start of the tour \"attitudes are contagious, is yours worth catching?\" \n \n\"From that, he extended it, saying this will be a 'no whinge tour',\" Gilchrist said. \"Forever we've come to India and we're beaten before we get here. We're whinging about the food, the conditions, the umpiring and the hotel room, the flights. We weren't allow to whinge, pretty much. It was amazing. \n \n\"It's a great question you can ask yourself every day: how you think is how you feel and that's how you're going to act, is yours worth catching? And that really helped. We didn't get the chocolates on that tour but it was a strong foundation to what lay ahead.\" \n \nAustralia's players were also given a mid-tour break between Tests in 2004, which allowed them to spend time in Singapore and the Maldives with family and partners. The current squad has been given time off between the second and third Tests but they will not be leaving the country. \n \nOn the field, Gilchrist said, Australia needed to buck with tradition and adopt a more conservative game plan like the 2004 team did. Smith has already foreshadowed a more defensive strategy with the bat. \n \n\"That allowed us to get into the game without being blown away and the deeper you take it the more chance you are,\" Gilchrist said. \"The tactics will be important.\" \n \nWhile Ponting has said a competitive series loss would be a positive, Gilchrist is drawing hope from England's strong start to their recent series against India where they fell just short of victory in the first Test. But he said it would be \"frightfully difficult\". \n \n\"There's no reason why they can't get there and start well and build up confidence and be competitive about challenging for the series,\" Gilchrist said. \n \n\"As is the way in India momentum swings, whether it's an innings, a Test or a series, once it's against you it's a hard freight train to stop.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrew Wu"},"topics":[{"name":"Retail industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Philadelphia 76ers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"India v Australia Test series: Adam Gilchrist tells Australia to embrace India","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Sydney Morning Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587970","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Sydney Morning Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Cricket","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.smh.com.au/","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203736314","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:24:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long. \n \nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports. \n \nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader. \n \nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion. \n \nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups. \n \nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism. \n \n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

Of more than 17,000 high schools in the United States that field varsity football teams, only 50 were being recognized on the 2016-17 MaxPreps Tour of Champions. \n   \nMaxPreps computer rankings were used to determine team ranks for its Tour of Champions. The system utilizes the huge number of game results stored in the MaxPreps database.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 58 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lancaster","zipCode":"17603","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169674001","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"WGAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203741885","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The team is also two wins shy of qualifying for the state tournament for the first time since the 2013-\u201914 season. \n \n\u201cWe have to keep fighting because there is a long road ahead of us,\u201d said head coach Brie Karow. \n \nCaroline Andersen led the way with 12 points and Christina Woods added 9. \n \nOn Friday night, during the Coaches vs Cancer Fundraiser, the Wildcats defeated Burlington, 58-44, for the team\u2019s third win in a row bringing their overall record to 7-4. Andersen led the way with 16 points and Woods added 11. \n \n\u201cThe girls worked hard all game,\u201d said Karow. \u201cIt was a great night for a great cause.\u201d \n \nThe Wildcats will look to qualify for the state tournament with three games this week including road trips to Winchester on Friday and Reading on Tuesday, before facing Tewksbury on Wednesday. \n \nBOYS HOOP \n \nThe WHS boys\u2019 basketball team fell to 3-10 on the season with an 84-62 road loss to Burlington on Friday night followed up by a 62-36 home loss to Arlington on Tuesday night. \n \nIn the loss to Burlington, the Red Devils jumped out to an early lead and never looked back. They led 24-13 after the first before building a 20-point lead into the third quarter. Wilmington did cut it down to 11 before Burlington opened it back up in the fourth. \n \nJoe Gaudreau led the way for the \u2018Cats with 25 points and 6 rebounds, while Dan Gracia added 19 points, 7 rebounds and 7 assists. \n \nOn Tuesday night, the teams were tied after the first quarter, trailed by eight at the half before the Spy Ponders opened the lead in the second half. \n \nGaudreau led the way with 11 points and Cam Walsh added nine. \n \nArlington forced Wilmington to turn the ball over 25 times. \n \nWilmington will return home for two games this week, Winchester on Friday and Reading on Tuesday. \n \nGIRLS HOCKEY \n \nThe WHS girls\u2019 hockey team fell to Burlington, 7-2, last Wednesday night. The loss puts the team\u2019s overall record to 2-4-4. \n \n\u201cWe were in that game in the second period, trailing by a goal,\u201d said coach Mike Gautreau. \u201cWe had a turnover while on the power play and a Burlington player got the puck and scored a short-handed goal. That seemed to change the momentum and we could never get it back.\u201d \n \nOlivia Wingate scored the Wildcats\u2019 first goal with helpers going to Payton Fuller and goalie Melanie Hayden, according to the scoresheet. Wingate assisted on the second goal sending Sam Grasso in on a breakaway and she found the back of the net. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re playing better and the effort is there,\u201d said Gautreau. \u201cIt\u2019s always there. I just think the girls need to listen a little better in special team\u2019s situations. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be working on a lot in the next few practices \u2014 special teams.\u201d \n \nWilmington has still been dealing with the injury bug, and that will continue this week as defenseman Molly Foley will most likely play one more game before missing the rest of the season due to knee surgery. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a big loss for us,\u201d said Gautreau. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need and find someone to fill her shoes.\u201d \n \nDespite the team losing 7-2, Gautreau said Hayden played exceptionally well. \n \n\u201cThe score doesn\u2019t reflect that, but she played another great game for us,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has kept us in every game this season and we don\u2019t even have a full team with all of the injuries.\u201d \n \nWilmington has a busy slate this week. On Wednesday the team faced Arlington with results not known as of presstime. On Thursday afternoon, the \u2018Cats will host St. Joe\u2019s Prep in a non-league game before hosting a very good Winchester team on Saturday afternoon at 2 pm. The home stretch will continue next Wednesday with Reading coming to town. \n  \n© 2017 Homenewshere.com. All rights reserved.

Karnesky was not able to get into the win column on the day, but Wildcats coach Joel McKenna was very impressed with his efforts. \n \n\u201cEthan is taking some lumps as part of the growth process this season. He wrestled at 106 pounds last season and now he is up wrestling 126 -132 pounds this season,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cIn wrestling terms this is a big jump. There is a big weight and strength difference. He is taking some losses this season, but over the past month, Ethan has shown a lot of grit and fight. Ethan is battling for six minutes every time he goes out there. Win lose or draw, Ethan's opponent will know that they were in a match. In the end Ethan didn't get the win but he competed and battled.\u201d \n \nAnother wrestler who impressed McKenna in this meet was junior John Cox at 138 pounds. Cox gave a very tough opponent a very good battle, but came up a little short. \n \n\u201cHis opponent (from Wakefield) has been a multiple time state place finisher,\u201d McKenna said. Johnny was another guy who went out there and wrestled tough. He wrestled without fear and for John that is the difference maker. He quickly took down his opponent and they battled back and forth with each wrestler reversing each other twice throughout the match. In the end John got turned and gave up some back points, and that was the difference in losing the match 13-5. It was a good match that John can take into the post season and learn from it. He needs to know what he is capable of doing.\u201d \n \nSenior captain Sam Jennings meanwhile, continues to pile up the wins for the Wildcats at 170 pounds, picking up two more wins on the day, including an overtime win over Wakefield. \n \n\u201cSam continued to roll. He was able to grind out a gutsy overtime win for himself,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cSam wasn't at 100% on Saturday. I think if he was at full strength the match would have been a lot different. I don't think that match goes to over time. That is the best thing about Sam is that even if he isn't 100 percent he will give his best shot and sometimes it isn't pretty. He is as tough as they make kids at this point in time, and he continues to be a beacon for his teammates to follow.\u201d \n \nHeavyweight Paxton Cook also won a pair of matches on the day for the Wildcats, both by pin, continuing to defy the odds against his much bigger opponents. \n \n\u201cPaxton continues to impress us every time he goes out on the mat. For a heavyweight, he is a strong competitor. He is not a big heavyweight either. He can sometimes be giving up 30-40 pounds of weight, but he will get out there and brawl,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cHe is out there to beat you, plain and simple. He has grown as a wrestler too. He listens and he follows instructions. He is becoming more and more a student of wrestling, asking questions. It has been a good transformation for him. He is tasting a lot of success.\u201d \n \nSenior captain Jimmy Carroll also wrestled some great matches for himself on Saturday at 220 pounds. \n \n\u201cJimmy has been wrestling well over the last few weeks. He is building to where he needs to be for the end of the season,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cHe looked great wrestling on top pinning his opponent from Saugus.\u201d \n \nMcKenna was happy with his team\u2019s effort on the day, and is hoping to see even better efforts from his team down the stretch of the season. \n \n\u201cOn this day we were at a disadvantage due to some injuries and illnesses,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cWe regrouped as a team and said that we will have a renewed sense of purpose with the last couple of weeks of the regular season and hopefully well will be getting some of these kids back to make a good push for the sectional tournament.\u201d \n \nThe Wildcats will be back in action on Saturday at the Middlesex League Meet which will be held at Wakefield High School. \n  \n© 2017 Homenewshere.com.

They are coming off a 1-1 tie with Malden Catholic, and we were right there with them,\u201d Scanlon said. \u201cWe skated really hard. I think we ran out of gas a little in the third period, but for the most part we stayed with them. If we play like this against most teams we will be able to get some wins.\u201d \n \nIt looked for a while like the Wildcats were going to get a win in this game as well. Trailing 1-0 at the end of a first period in which Burlington for the most part controlled play, the Wildcats came out strong in the second period, pressing the attack in the early going. \n \nSophomore forward Ryan Barrett probably had the best early chance for the Wildcats, picking up a loose puck from behind the net and attempting to stuff it in behind the Burlington goalie, but he was denied. Barrett\u2019s efforts behind the net, however, would provide some good foreshadowing for what was to come later in the game. \n \nJunior forward Bobby Lord finally broke the ice for the Wildcats, beating Burlington goalie Paul Barbieri with a power play goal at 9:28 of the period, putting in a rebound off the post to tie the game 1-1, with assists going to junior defensemen Jarred Aucoin and Anthony McKearney, who had executed a perfect D to D pass at the blue line before Aucoin put the shot on net and Lord pounced on the rebound. \n \nThe score would remain the same heading into the third period, but it didn\u2019t take Burlington long to retake the lead, with senior captain Patrick O\u2019Halloran putting a seeing eye slap shot past Wilmington goalie Ryan St. Jean just 24 seconds into the period. \n \nBurlington would control play for the next several minutes, but it was the Wildcats who would be next on the board, with Barrett finally being rewarded for what was a great overall game. Moments after being denied on a breakaway, Barrett once again set up behind the Burlington net. A Burlington defender attempted to steal the puck from Barrett, but instead ended up banking the puck off the back of the Burlington goalie\u2019s leg and into the net to tie the game at 2-2 with 9:06 left in the game. Barrett was given credit for the goal, while senior captain Joshua Buske picked up the assist. \n \nBurlington would once again respond, as less than two minutes later senior Drew Metzdorf scored on a great wrist shot from the faceoff circle, through a screen for a 3-2 lead with 7:18 left in the game. \n \nBurlington controlled play for the rest of the game, out shooting the Wildcats 13-3 in the period, but they were unable to extend their lead thanks to several great stops from St. Jean, who was outstanding throughout the game, making 32 saves, but particularly over the final 15 minutes when the game could have gotten out hand. \n \nThe performance was nothing new for St. Jean, who has been great all season for the Wildcats. \n \n\u201cThrough the first ten games, he has really been our MVP,\u201d Scanlon said. \u201cHe makes big saves and plays well when he\u2019s getting peppered. He\u2019s having a good year.\u201d \n \nOffensively, while the Wildcats scored only two goals, and were held very much in check in the third period, they were able to create several offensive opportunities on the day, moving the puck well to create scoring chances. \n \nOffense has been hard to come by this season for the Wildcats, who have scored just 22 goals in ten games this season, including six in a 6-3 win over Medford last Wednesday, but with that six goal effort, as well as the improved play against Burlington, Scanlon is hoping his team is on the verge of turning things around. \n \n\u201cWe were a little bit better. Goals have been hard to come by for us, but I thought we created some stuff,\u201d Scanlon said. \u201cWe had 20 shots on goal, so I think we are getting better in that department. Wednesday night we were able to get things going and build our confidence a little bit. We are hoping that we are starting to get something going. It is about getting timely goals and more goal scoring.\u201d \n \nThe Wildcats got plenty of goal scoring last Wednesday night in their 6-3 win over Medford, breaking open what was a 0-0 game after the first period, getting single goals from Connor Benoit, Dan Woods, Ryan Barrett, Bobby Lord, Joey Mirabella and Josh Buske. St. Jean (17 shots, 14 saves) combined with junior goalie Stephen Bowker (5 shots, 5 saves) to pick up the win in net. \n \n\u201cIt was a back and forth first period, but we had a little bit of explosion with six goals from six different goal scorers and three of them from kids with their first varsity goals,\u201d Scanlon said. \n \nThe Wildcats were back in action on Wednesday night, traveling to Ed Burns Arena in Arlington to take on Arlington High School, and they will continue a tough stretch of games on Saturday afternoon against Winchester at O\u2019Brien Arena, before facing Wakefield at Ristuccia Monday night at 8 pm.

We are a country where measurement is almost an anathema. The problem is not that of government alone but a general reluctance even in the academia to measure output. \n\nLet us look around our various touch points to see if we can say with certainty that we know whether there has been improvement or not. Let\u2019s take electricity for one, every year we discuss how many megawatts of electricity is generated, sometimes we hear 4000MW another time we hear 5000MW. When we announce these numbers, it is supposed to be understood by everybody, including my grandmother in the village, that we are making progress. The fact that all the technical information provided about transmission, distribution and generation have little meaning to the consumer who only wants light in his house, office or factory seem to not move the electricity providers. \n\nIn more numerate culture, the information to the consumer would have been broken to how many hours of electricity you receive daily and the time belt that you have the most unbroken supply of power. This information will make it possible for us to measure month on month, year on year if we are making progress in providing electricity to the consumer throughout the country. With that information, we can also see the regional and state variations and possibly link that to the investments we are making in the power sector. Further analysis will also reveal how much of the distributed power is paid for to enable us link supply to revenue. This kind of visibility will provide an environment that can attract more private sector investment and enable the government hold officials accountable. \n\nIn the area of security, we see another example of absence of measurement supporting stereotypes and perception of safety. Annually, the Police publish crime statistics and that is the end. I have not seen the police showcase the impact of the statistics to the average citizen. The question is: are you safer today? Is crime higher in your locality than state and national average? What is the national average of homicide, armed robbery or kidnapping? Are more people killed, robbed or kidnapped in my community? How effective is the Police station in my neighbourhood? How many emergency calls did they receive last month and what was their response rate? How many reports were lodged at the station and what are the status of the reports? \n\nWe need data to make informed decisions about where we live, site our businesses and educate our children. If we have these statistics, it may well be that many Nigerians who sent their children abroad, ostensibly because of higher quality education and safety, may well find out that Nsukka or Ife is safer than Chicago or Johannesburg. \n\nTalking about education, a family friend moved his son to this very expensive international school that is supposed to make it easy for his son to walk into an Ivy League university abroad. As he excitedly told me how happy he is about the school, I asked him if the school provided any information on the number of students from the school who are currently in Ivy League universities or passed out from same. I also asked him if he checked the average SAT scores of past students of the school. He had no answers but mumbled some words about checking out the facts. \n\nIt is still a mystery to me how parents are spending so much money on private school education without inquiring about the outputs from the schools from third party standardised tests. We need to see both public and private schools publicise the average scores of their students in JAMB, WAEC, NECO and foreign tests top enable comparison and measurement. \n\nWhen Nigerians troop abroad for \u201cmedicals\u201d they are voting with their feet against what many consider our poor medical facilities and rampant misdiagnosis. The horror stories are told about the mistakes of Nigerian doctors and the deaths arising from the murderous gang. Curiously the issue of misdiagnosis is an international problem according to the British Medical Journal quoted by the Financial Times of London. One in eight patients are misdiagnosed in the UK. The report pointed out that medical error kills about one thousand people a month in the UK and is also the third leading cause of death in the US. Yet Nigerians think we are the worst, which is possible, but we need to see hospital data by locality to support or disprove that and help accountability. \n\nWe need to see hospital websites provide information about patient throughput and the outcomes. We need to match the hospital budget for public hospitals, or charges for private hospitals to the treatment rates and output. Many state governments still engage in building new hospitals where utilisation rate of existing ones are, in many cases, below 40 per cent. \n\nAt the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), automating data collection revealed trends informing proactive action that led to reduction in road crashes. Turning the annual ritual of publishing crash data to a daily exercise revealed the states and routes with the most crashes and fatalities. In 2013 when the data collection went fully electronic, we discovered that the top three states by crashes recorded were FCT, Kaduna and Nasarawa. It also revealed that the top three states by deaths were Kaduna, Oyo and FCT. \n\nContrary to common sense, it was discovered that the top crash-prone route was not Lagos-Ibadan but Abuja \u2013 Kubwa expressway followed by Abuja \u2013 Nyanya and Abuja \u2013 Lokoja. Lagos \u2013 Ibadan was number 7 on the list. Data revealed that Toyota hiace was the most involved in crashes in the bus category while Volkswagen Golf was the most involved in the car category. The FRSC call centre in 2013 handled 48,032 calls and responded within 35 minutes nationwide while Abuja averaged 25 minutes. Intervention to stem crashes became a dynamic action of reviewing manpower and resource allocation to ensure optimal utilisation. \n\nThe data automation process at the FRSC was motivated by my motto of Monitor, Measure and Improve. It didn\u2019t come as a surprise to stakeholders when the World Bank declared FRSC the best example of a Road Safety Lead Agency in the developing world. The key message is that we need to move from anecdotes to measurement. We need to move from an innumerate to a numerate culture if we want to benefit from the 21st century. Measurement can only lead to improvement and informed decision.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Wale Suleiman"},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Building A Culture Of Measurement","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Leadership","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"291406177","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"384"},"name":"Leadership","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.leadership.ng"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203748266","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:17:22Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If Mr Ang is living in a 3-room HDB flat, the  S & CC rebates  for 2013 was only for 2 months, not to mention that 7 town councils increased S & CC in late 2012. \n \nDoes he get additional S & CC rebates in view of his circumstances? \n \nAccording to the MOF web site \u2013 \u201cThose living in 3- to 4-room HDB flats can offset up to  4 months of utilities bill s on average\u201d \u2013 does he get additional utilities rebates in view of his circumstances? \n \nSavings depleted by deceased\u2019s wife\u2019s medical costs? \n \nAs to \u201cMr Ang hopes this year\u2019s Budget will give him some extra pocket money for a rainy day. \u201cMy biggest worry is what will happen to my special needs daughter when I am not around,\u201d he frets. \u201cI have depleted my savings over my wife\u2019s chemotherapy sessions\u201d \n \n\u2013 why did Mr Ang have to deplete his savings to pay for his wife\u2019s chemotherapy sessions? Whatever happened to our MediShield, Medisave, Medifund assistance, etc? \n \nDropped to 150th Press Freedom ranking?  \n \nIf this is the  best kind of example that we can come up with, to promulgate the propaganda that we are helping Singaporeans  in a big way \u2013 is it any wonder that our Press Freedom ranking has just dropped another notch to 150th?\u201d \n \nExample No. 2  (\u201c Foreigners make up 50.5% of total workforce in Singapore? \u201c, May 1, 2014): \n \n\u201cIn the article, \u201c Jobless rate inches up amid tight labour market \u201d (Straits Times, May 1, 2014), it is stated that the unemployment rate for Singapore citizens was 3 per cent last quarter, up from 2.8 per cent, while that for residents (Singapore citizens and permanent residents) was 2.9 per cent, up from 2.7 per cent. \n \nAccording to the Ministry of Manpower\u2019s (MOM) Employment Situation First Quarter 2014 report, there were 3,518,700 persons in employment in March 2014. \n \nAn estimated 59,300 residents, including 52,300 Singapore citizens, were unemployed in March 2014 while the seasonally adjusted figures were 62,500 for residents and 55,700 for citizens. [Statistics from  MOM report .] \n \nOnly 49.5 per cent of total workforce are Singaporeans? \n \nSo, although there is no breakdown of the employment statistics for residents into Singaporeans and permanent residents (PRs), if we divide 52,300 unemployed Singaporeans by their 3 per cent unemployment rate, we get 1,743,333 Singaporeans in the workforce. \n \nDivide this 1,743,333 by the total employment in Singapore of 3,518.700, and we get 49.5 per cent. \n \nTherefore, does this mean that about 50.5 per cent of the workforce are not Singaporeans? \n \nIf so, then we may have reached a milestone in our labour statistics \u2013 with more than half of the workforce being non-citizens for the first time in Singapore\u2019s history. \n \nWhatever happened to the consistent rhetoric in recent years that the influx of foreign labour will be curtailed? \n \n133,033 new citizens = 55 per cent not \u201cSingaporeans\u201d?  \n \nIf we make an adjustment for the 133,033 new citizenships granted from 2007 to 2013, what percentage of the workforce are not originally Singaporeans? Is this about 55 per cent or more? \n \n150th Press Freedom ranking? \n \nFinally, don\u2019t you feel that there may be something wrong with the title of the subject news report \u2013 \u201c Jobless rate inches up amid tight labour market \u201d?  In a tight labour market, shouldn\u2019t the unemployment rate go down instead of up? \u201d \n \nExample No. 3  (\u201c HDB Studios subsidised \u2026 after MDA licensing starts? \u201c, May 29, 2013): \n \n\u201cI refer to Raymond Ng\u2019s letter \u201c Reveal the actual cost of public housing \u201d (Today, May 25, 2013). \n \nFormula for HDB subsidies? \n \nMr Ng asked \u201chow the Housing and Development Board (HDB) derives its formula for \u201csubsidies\u201d for each housing type and the profit margins\u201d. \n \nWell, I thought that a good starting point in trying to dwell deeper into this question (since years of repeated calls by MPs and citizens for this \u201ctop secret\u201d information has fallen on deaf ears!) may be to examine the cheapest HDB flats that one can buy. \n \nI refer to the booklet \u201cEnhancing Your Retirement Income\u201d. \n \nSell flat buy studio? \n \nIt states that \u201cMove to a smaller flat or Studio Apartment \u2013 when doing so, you can choose to sign up for the Silver Housing Bonus (SHB), which provides additional financial help to lower-income elderly, who sell their flat and buy a smaller one\u201d. \n \nWhy 30-year lease so expensive? \n \nSince a Studio Apartment has a lease of only 30 years, why is it that it cost almost as much as a 2-room flat with a 99-year lease? \n \nCan\u2019t be sold in open market? \n \nMoreover, a Studio Apartment cannot be sold in the open market like 2-room flats, and as I understand it, can only be sold back to the HDB after a Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) of 5 years. \n \nHigher profit margin? \n \nSo, in view of the above, is the profit margin higher for Studio Apartments compared to 2-room flats. \n \nIf this is the case \u2013 why? \n \nHelping lower-income retirees? \n \nArguably, are we really helping lower-income retirees to monetise their existing HDB flat, by selling Studio Apartments to them at such \u201crelatively\u201d high prices? \n \nIn this connection, the lowest priced BTO Studio Apartments in Choa Chu Kang were from $58,000 to $66,000 (December 2008 BTO) and $77,000 to $104,000 (January 2012 BTO). \n \nPSM \u2013 Studio cost as much as 3-room? \n \nFor 3-room flats in the same January 2012  Choa Chu Kang BTO, the price range was $146,000 to $172,000. \n \nUsing the floor area of 37/47 sqm for studio and 68 sqm for 3-room, the psm is $2,081 to $2,213 for studio and $2,147 to $2,529 for 3-room. \n \nSo, on a psm basis comparison, Studio Apartments can cost as much as 3-room flats. Why? \n \nIn mature estates like Queenstown, prices were from $113,000 to $168,000 (November 2012 BTO). \n \nI have been told that one could buy a Studio Apartment for only around $50,000 about a decade or so ago. \n \nBreakdown of costs? \n \nIn view of the 30-year lease, what is the breakdown of the construction and land costs for Studio Apartments? \n \nTop-up CPF $90,000 to get SHB $20,000? \n \nIn the booklet\u2019s \u201cSHB Example 3 \u2013 A couple sells their 5-room flat to buy a Studio Apartment for $100,000, and top-up their CPF accounts to enroll in the CPF Life Scheme. \n \nThey use $90,000 of their flat\u2019s cash sale proceeds to top up their CPF to get a $20,000 Silver Housing Bonus. \n \nWhere does the money go? \n \nSince the CPF Life annuity payouts are projected (in this example \u2013 $975 to $1,071 (husband) and $764 \u2013 $843 (Wife)) at the average yield of the 10-year government bond plus 1 per cent, in a sense the Government gets to utilize $70,000 from this couple. \n \nSo, what happens to this $70,000? \n \nWhat returns on the money? \n \nWell, since the total sum of our reserves and the rate of return on our reserves is not known, we can only look at Temasek\u2019s 17 per cent per annum return over the last 34 years or so, and GIC\u2019s 6 per cent per annum in US$ over the last 20 years or so, as a guide. \n \nWhat happens to excess returns? \n \nIf the average return that is derived from this example of $70,000 from this couple exceeds the 10-year government bond yield plus 1 per cent, in the future \u2013 then, in a way, the Government gets to keep the excess. \n \nWho\u2019s making how much for what? \n \nIn the final analysis, can the experts give us some ideas about how much the Government makes or lose from Studio Apartments and CPF Life for the entire population of Singaporeans now and into the future? \n \nOne-way ride to oblivion? \n \nSince the accumulation of our reserves are like a never ending one-way ride that never seems to be returned to benefit Singaporeans, is the Government\u2019s gain in a sense a loss to Singaporeans? \n \nStudios subsidised? \n \nOr, are Studio Apartments subsidised at a loss, as we have always been told about the Market Subsidy Pricing of HDB flats? \n \nAre there any countries in the world that helps their retirees to retire, by way of the above? \n \nNew MDA licensing rules? \n \nStop press! You may not be able to read any more articles like the above soon \u2013 that tries to analyse whether HDB flats are really subsidised (or for that matter healthcare) \u2013 because when the new MDA licensing requirements (\u201c Singapore to regulate Yahoo!, other online news sites \u201c, Reuters, May 28 ) announced on 28 May kicks in \u2013 volunteer citizen web sites like theonlinecitizen and TR Emeritus may become history. \n \nIn this regard, to quote the article \u201c TOC\u2019s statement on MDA licensing of online news sites \u201d (theonlinecitizen May 28 ) \u2013 \u201cwe will have to reassess the viability of continuing the website in light of the significant financial and legal liability the new rules impose\u201d. \n \nPress freedom dying a slow death? \n \nYou wanna bet that Singapore\u2019s press freedom ranking will fall to yet another record low from the current 149th \u2013 thanks to  yet another draconian rule to dampen free speech and freedom of expression  in Singapore! \n \nMajulah Singapura! \n \nYou can kiss goodbye to Article 23 \u2013   Every person has the right to freedom of opinion and expression, including freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information , whether orally, in writing or through any other medium of that person\u2019s choice\u201d of the  ASEAN HUMAN RIGHTS DECLARATION  \u2013 which also states \u2013 \u201cREAFFIRMING FURTHER our commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Charter of the United Nations, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, and other international human rights instruments to which ASEAN Member States are parties\u201d\u201d.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Singapore news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"So Chee Hong Tat\u2019s \u201ccredible and reliable news source\u201d means keeping press suppressed at 154th?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"SG","country":"Singapore"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Independent.sg","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"610102831","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Independent.sg","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://theindependent.sg"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/critical-for-singapore-to-continue-to-have-a-reliable-news/3474374.html","http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/04/20/singapore-drops-another-rank-to-154th-in-world-press-freedom-index-yet-another-lowest/","https://leongszehian.com/?p=7797","http://www.straitstimes.com/the-big-story/budget-2014/story/aid-office-near-home-boon-widower-three-children-20140219","http://www.cpf.gov.sg/cpf_info/Online/Contri.asp?prof=emp","http://app.mof.gov.sg/newsroom_details.aspx?type=press&cmpar_year=2013&news_sid=20130328447173805498","http://app.mof.gov.sg/newsroom_details.aspx?type=press&cmpar_year=2013&news_sid=20131230193530679575","http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2014/05/01/foreigners-make-up-50-5-of-total-workforce-in-singapore/","http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/more-singapore-stories/story/jobless-rate-inches-amid-tight-labour-market-20140501","http://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Employment-Situation-First-Quarter-2014.aspx","http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2013/05/29/hdb-studios-subsidised-after-mda-licensing-starts/","http://www.todayonline.com/voices/reveal-actual-cost-public-housing","http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/28/net-us-singapore-internet-idUSBRE94R0G220130528","http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2013/05/tocs-statement-on-mda-licensing-of-online-news-site/","http://www.asean.org/news/asean-statement-communiques/item/asean-human-rights-declaration"],"sequenceId":"695203748438","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:15:49Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They started out playing together in Compton, California, hardly a hotbed for tennis, with their father Richard and mother Oracene as coach and mentor. And they still practice and travel together around the world. \n \nThey met for the first time at a major at Melbourne Park in 1998 \u2014 Venus won that one. In 2003, when the younger of the Williams siblings completed her \"Serena Slam\" of four consecutive titles, Venus was on the other side of the net. She didn't reach another Australian final for 14 years. \n \nWhen Serena sat on the court, holding both arms up to celebrate on Saturday, Venus walked over to her sister's side of the net for a hug. \n \n\"This was a tough one,\" Serena said. \"I really would like to take this moment to congratulate Venus, she's an amazing person \u2014 she's my inspiration. \n \n\"There's no way I would be at 23 without her \u2014 there's no way I would be at one without her. Thank you Venus for inspiring me to be the best player I can be and inspiring me to work hard.\" \n \nAsked if it felt awkward to be on the receiving end of so many losses to her sister, the 36-year-old Venus didn't flinch. \n \n\"No, because I guess I've been here before,\" she said. \"I really enjoy seeing the name Williams on the trophy. This is a beautiful thing.\" \n \nVenus won the last of her seven majors in 2008 at Wimbledon. She didn't make the second week of a major for a few years as she came to terms with an energy-sapping illness after being diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome in 2011. And she only made it back to the semifinals last year at Wimbledon. \n \nAnother shot at a first Australian Open title was a sign of progress, she said. \n \n\"That's exactly where I want to be standing during these Grand Slams, is on finals day, having an opportunity,\" she said. \"That's the highlight of all this, is to be in that moment.\" \n \nSerena Williams, meanwhile, enjoyed the fact she made history in Melbourne. Only Margaret Court, with 24, is in front of her in terms of overall Grand Slam singles titles, although the Australian great won 13 of her Grand Slams before the Open era began in 1968. \n \n\"My first Grand Slam started here, and getting to 23 here, but playing Venus, it's stuff that legends are made of,\" Serena said. \"I couldn't have written a better story.\" \n \nThe match didn't live up to its classic billing, with nerves and tension causing uncharacteristic mistakes and unforced errors, with four consecutive service breaks before Venus finally held for a 3-2 lead in the first set. That included a game when Serena had game point but served back-to-back double-faults and three in all to give up the break. \n \nThere were six service breaks in total. Both players were relatively subdued, except when Serena smashed her racket in the third game. \n \nAfter the fourth game, however, Serena Williams didn't face another break point in the 1-hour, 22-minute match. \n \n\"Serena Williams, that's my little sister,\" Venus said. \"I have been right there with you. Some of them I have lost right there against you. It's been an awesome thing, your win has always been my win.\" \n \nIn terms of total years, it was the oldest Grand Slam women's final in the Open era \u2014the Williams sisters combining for 71 years, 11 months. \n \nRoger Federer will be aiming to increase his all-time men's record to 18 when he takes on 14-time major winner Rafael Nadal on Sunday, completing the singles finals lineup of all 30-somethings. \n \nBob and Mike Bryan missed out on a doubles record, losing the final 7-5, 7-5 to Henri Kontinen of Finland and John Peers of Australia. \n \nThe third-seeded twins were trying to win their 17th Grand Slam title, which would have tied them with John Newcombe. \n \nSpeaking of records, Serena got a little bit superstitious Down Under, and hadn't wanted to talk about the No. 23 until she got it. \n \nNow there's a limited-edition racket \u2014 23 of them to be released \u2014 and some custom-made shoes sent by former NBA great Jordan. It had Jordan's usual jersey number No. 23 stamped on the heel, helping to provide some synchronicity for the numbers involved.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"23: Serena Williams sets major record with win over Venus","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"R8N","state":"Manitoba","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Thompson","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Thompson Citizen","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169670545","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Thompson Citizen","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thompsoncitizen.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203758651","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

That\u2019s when the Tigers climbed back into the game. \n \nDrew Michaels\u2019 3-pointer started a 12-2 run to end the second quarter, including a stretch over the final 10 seconds that saw Harward pick up his third foul and the Tigers scoring five points in the final eight seconds to send the teams to the break tied at 29. \n \nThings didn\u2019t get much better early in the third quarter as Harward (16 points) picked up his fourth foul and Southern Columbia (7-7) took a 36-33 lead on a Julian Fleming drive with 4:40 left in the third period. \n \nThat\u2019s when Bickhart took over, scoring eight consecutive points to give Danville a 41-36 lead. \n \n\u201cI felt we were down and we needed momentum,\u201d Bickhart said. \u201cI just started shooting and hoping they would go in.\u201d \n \nThe lead climbed to 47-38 on a Holcombe (13 points) foul shot with 28 seconds left in the third quarter. \n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s good about it, is we were down and Dyson went out, we responded without our big man,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty nice to see. We didn\u2019t panic.\u201d \n \nFleming hit a 3 to pull the Tigers within six early in the fourth, but again Danville pushed the lead to nine with 5:01 left in the game on a Shane Kozick jumper. \n \nSouthern Columbia answered with junior guard Brett Szuler. Szuler didn\u2019t attempt a shot until the fourth quarter, but he nailed two 3-pointers, including one from the Tiger emblem on the floor to help the Tigers get to within 54-51 with 2:48 left in the game. \n \nHolcombe scored inside to push the lead to 56-51 before Garrett Henry hit a jumper with 2:00 left to again pull Southern within three. That\u2019s when Harward closed out the game for Danville with a bucket inside and nailing four straight shots from the free-throw line over the 27 seconds to seal the game. \n \n\u201cNo lead is safe against Southern Columbia. I\u2019ve seen them go off a couple times this season,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThis is a great win for our kids and should give us some confidence for the stretch run.\u201d \n \nShane Kozick led the Ironmen with 18 points. Harward and Holcombe each had seven rebounds, while Peyton Riley had seven points, six assists and three steals. \n \nFleming was the lone Tigers\u2019 player in double figures with 21.  \n \nEmail comments to thummel@dailyitem.com .

Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov.

When the potential game-tying free throw was missed, Thacker corralled the rebound. Her teammate Saylair Grandon, who had a double-double, chuckled because Thacker inadvertently nudged over Bengal Freya Newton to get the board. \n \n\u201cIf it\u2019s in the air, it\u2019s a loose ball,\u201d said Grandon, who had 14 points and 10 rebounds. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got to go get it. \n \nEven if it\u2019s against your own teammate,\u201d added a joking Grandon. \n \nAfter Thacker secured the defensive rebound, the Australia native made two free throws at the other end, increasing Idaho State\u2019s lead to 55-52, which turned out to be enough as Weber State (8-11, 2-6 Big Sky Conference) could not get a clean look at a 3. \n \nThe Bengals were 22 of 27 from the free-throw line, a noteworthy stat considering they had a 65.3 free-throw percentage in conference play, ranked 11th in the Big Sky. \n \nTo improve that area, the Bengals increased their repetitions at the charity stripe. ISU, which normally shoots free throws five minutes per day, took them before, during and following each practice for 55 total minutes this week. \n \nThe Bengals (10-9, 4-4 Big Sky), who play Thursday at Northern Arizona, needed every point they earned in yet another close home game. Reed Gym has been host to four basketball games decided by fewer than six points this season, three of which ISU has won. \n \nThe Bengals had to climb into the game to have a shot at defeating the Wildcats, trailing for nearly the first 13 minutes of the matchup and down by as many as seven points. Freshman Estefania Ors triggered a run to put the Bengals ahead, contributing seven points in a 9-0 run to put her team ahead 20-18. \n \nIdaho State created separation in the third quarter, outscoring Weber State 14-6 and holding its rival to 12 percent shooting. While the Wildcats tried to charge back, it was behind for the final 15:14 of the game. \n \nFollow @JeffPapworth","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jeff Papworth jpapworth@journalnet.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"ISU WBB: Bengals survive 57-52 against rival Weber State","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bannock","zipCode":"83204","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Pocatello","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Idaho State Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675817","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"473"},"name":"Idaho State Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.idahostatejournal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/JeffPapworth"],"sequenceId":"695203779582","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:22:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Our real fear, and we may already be there, is that they will use mercenaries, people who will do anything for money,\u201d Poupard said. \n \nThe Islamic State group, Al-Qaeda and other jihadist groups are so far using the internet mainly for propaganda and recruitment purposes. \n \n\u201cThe skills are complex, though not at the level of a nuclear weapon,\u201d Poupard said. \n \n\u201cWith a few dozen people, a little money, but not that much, you can be effective.\u201d \n \n\n \nEarlier this month, Europol director Rob Wainwright also warned of the use of digital mercenaries by jihadist groups at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \n \n\u201cEven if they don\u2019t have access to the capabilities, they can simply buy it on the darknet (a hidden internet realm of encrypted websites), where there is an enormous trade in cyber criminal technology,\u201d Wainwright said at a panel discussion on \u201cTerrorism in the Digital Age\u201d. \n \n\u201cThat said, attacking the critical national infrastructures at least of most countries is... not easily done, and it\u2019s something that is not as immediate and showy as firing automatic weapons in a theatre or in public,\u201d he added. \n \nData pirates and cyber criminals from several countries, often linked to organised crime, offer their services on the darknet. \n \nEven if they don\u2019t have access to the capabilities, they can simply buy it on the darknet \n \nEuropol director Rob Wainwright \n \nGiven the anonymity of the sites, some may help jihadists without realising it. \n \n\u201cIn fact, that\u2019s our fear,\u201d Poupard said. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s no so much that IS can quickly develop cyberattacks but that they will be able to go through intermediaries.\u201d \n \nSpeaking in Davos, retired Pakistani general Raheel Sharif said cyber terrorism is \u201ca real threat\u201d. \n \n\u201cAs technology improves, the possibility exists that someone can hack into a very sophisticated system and control that resource in such a way as to do maximum damage somewhere.\u201d \n \n\n \nMost developed countries are steadily boosting their defences against the cyber threat, be it terrorism, crime or espionage. \n \n\u201cTerrorist groups that currently use the internet for planning, propaganda and recruitment purposes could become full players in the cyber arena,\u201d French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said last month as he unveiled his country\u2019s policy on military cyber security. \n \n\u201cSince asymmetrical operations are naturally etched into their DNA, cyber space gives them an obvious field of action, where major damage can be inflicted with limited means,\u201d he said. \n \nDisturbing precursors of more insidious actions ahead are internet interlopers that do not steal or destroy data but appear to map websites, preparing offensive weapons for later use. \n \n\u201cThis kind of attack has even begun in some countries,\u201d Poupard said. \u201cWe are closely following what\u2019s happening in Ukraine where strange breakdowns are becoming frequent that are caused by extremely sophisticated actions.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Terrorism news","group":"Society"},{"name":"International relations news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Could jihadists paralyse a city - with help from \u2018cyber mercenaries\u2019?","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Eastern Asia","countryCode":"HK","country":"Hong Kong"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"South China Morning Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169685908","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"216"},"name":"South China Morning Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.scmp.com","publisher":"South China Morning Post Publishers"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203784682","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/140x87/public/images/methode/2017/01/29/ad54ea72-e5fa-11e6-8801-9f557f980a64_image_hires.JPG?itok=ZnWe6FR_"}],"video":[]}}

That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.\n\nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.\n\nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government.\n\nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.\n\n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\"\n\nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.\n\n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said.\n\n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\"\n\nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. An has temporarily stopped the government from sending those who landed with valid visas out of the country.\n\nCrowds of protesters have gathered at US airports in response to the order and subsequent detainments.

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale\u2019s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\u201cThe judge\u2019s order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US \u2014 it doesn\u2019t immediately order that they be released from detention,\u201d he told CNN. \n \n\u201cWe are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\u201d he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \u201cour courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump\u2019s controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \u201conly for nationals of countries for whom\u201d members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump\u2019s order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\u201cAmerica is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump\u2019s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump\u2019s order and pledged continued action. \n \n\u201cThis should not happen in America,\u201d Velazquez said following Darweesh\u2019s release. \u201cOne by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\u201d \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\u201cBecause the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK\u2019s Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\u201cWhen Mr. Darweesh\u2019s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u2018Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\u201d the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\u201cOur courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump\u2019s order puts those who have helped us in harm\u2019s way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, titled \u201cProtection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\u201cI am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security.\u201d \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"New York","zipCode":"10121","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"New York","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"77 WABC RADIO","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"197961871","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"29"},"name":"77 WABC RADIO","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wabcradio.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/ny-immigration-order-stay/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695203791274","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. \n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. \n\nThe Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up. Crowder scored eight of the Celtics' first 11 points to help Boston get out to a nine-point lead in the first 21/2 minutes. \n\nThat was just the beginning of what ended up as a 42-point first quarter for the Celtics. With Crowder leading the way with 11 points and Thomas chipping in 10, the Celtics picked apart the Bucks' defense on the way to 63.2 percent shooting from the field in the period in addition to 11-of-11 shooting from the free-throw line. Gerald Green put the exclamation point on the quarter by making a 25-footer before the buzzer that gave the Celtics a 42-27 lead after 12 minutes. \n\nIn that opening stanza, the Bucks got nothing from Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker. Milwaukee's leading scorers combined to go 0-of-8 from the field as Michael Beasley shouldered the scoring load off the bench with 11 points. \n\nAntetokounmpo made his first three shots of the second quarter, including a pair of dunks, to highlight an 8-0 run that brought the Bucks within eight, but that was as close as they would get. That's because Thomas subbed back in and went on a tear. He got fouled shooting a 3-pointer and made all three free throws, made a 26-footer and a 30-footer and hooked a left-handed layup over Snell on the way to scoring 13 points in the final six minutes of the second quarter, putting him at 23 at the half.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MATT VELAZQUEZMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Milwaukee Bucks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Boston Celtics news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NBA news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Thomas shines again as Celtics hold off Bucks for 112-108 OT win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fayette","zipCode":"40507","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lexington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kentucky.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658700","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4463"},"name":"Kentucky.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kentucky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203808768","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But they're better right now. Until we improve, they're going to keep beating us.\" \n\nRivers mostly sat and witnessed his team go down in the third quarter under an avalanche of Stephen Curry three-point slings and Warriors points that sent the Clippers to their eighth consecutive defeat to Golden State. \n\n\"If I won eight games in a row, I would have a mental edge,\" Rivers said. \n\nCurry, supposedly playing with a sore left quadriceps, detonated for 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter. He was five for eight from three-point range in the period, during which he seemed to be playing alone. \n\nFor the game he was 15 for 23 from the field, nine for 15 from three-point range. \n\nOf all the 72 points the Clippers surrendered in the first half, the most painful had to be when Curry eased up the court and casually and knowingly hoisted a three-pointer from half court that splashed through the net as the halftime buzzer sounded. \n\nThe fans went crazy. The Warriors celebrated, none more so than Draymond Green, who chest-bumped Curry so hard he fell on the court. Curry stayed on his belly for a few seconds, his arms extended. \n\nThe Clippers could only solemnly trudge to their locker room. \n\n\"We can talk about, like, being who we are. But who are we?\" Clippers guard J.J. Redick said. \"To me, we're the most inconsistent team, maybe in the league. Like, we're inconsistent. That's who we are. So, like, if we're going to be inconsistent, we can't expect to come in here and play these guys and be inconsistent and play well. It's not realistic.\" \n\nThe Clippers have lost four of five games since point guard Chris Paul had surgery for a torn thumb ligament that is expected to sideline him six to eight weeks. \n\nBut they will see the Warriors again Thursday night at Staples Center knowing it's going to take a better effort than this one. \n\nBlake Griffin, in his second game back after missing 18 games following right knee surgery, had 20 points for a Clippers team that was never in this game. \n\nThe total destruction by the Warriors notwithstanding, Rivers has been unsure what has put him in a weakened state. \n\n\"It has been three weeks now, so it's not been a fun stretch,\" he said. \"I'll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BRODERICK TURNERLos Angeles Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NBA news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Curry, Warriors clobber Clippers, 144-98","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fayette","zipCode":"40507","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lexington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kentucky.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658700","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4463"},"name":"Kentucky.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kentucky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203809174","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 59 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sacramento","zipCode":"95814","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Sacramento","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KCRA.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662541","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"522"},"name":"KCRA.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kcra.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203819034","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The sequel to 2012's Dishonored, the game is available for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The series takes place in the fictional Empire of the Isles with the majority of Dishonored 2 set in the coastal city of Karnaca. After Empress Emily Kaldwin is deposed by an \"otherworldly usurper\", the player may choose between playing as either Emily or her bodyguard and father Corvo Attano as they attempt to reclaim the throne. \n \nDishonored 2 is set fifteen years after the first Dishonored, wherein Corvo Attano restored Emily Kaldwin to the throne after being framed for her mother's assassination. Dunwall has prospered under the reign of Emily, who has been training with Corvo to protect herself from assassins. The Empire is plunged into chaos when the Empress is suddenly dethroned by an \"otherworldly usurper\", and becomes an outlaw to society.

The method is 10,000 times more sensitive than current methods employed by spacecraft like NASA's Mars Curiosity rover, according to researchers. \n\nOne of the key advantages of the new way of using capillary electrophoresis is that the process is relatively simple and easy to automate for liquid samples expected on ocean world missions. \n\nIt involves combining a liquid sample with a liquid reagent, followed by chemical analysis under conditions determined by the team. \n\nBy shining a laser across the mixture - a process known as laser-induced fluorescence detection - specific molecules can be observed moving at different speeds. They get separated based on how quickly they respond to electric fields. \n\nWhile capillary electrophoresis has been around since the early 1980s, this is the first time it has been tailored specifically to detect extraterrestrial life on an ocean world, said Jessica Creamer, a postdoctoral scholar at JPL. \n\n\"Our method improves on previous attempts by increasing the number of amino acids that can be detected in a single run,\" Creamer said. \n\n\"Additionally, it allows us to detect these amino acids at very low concentrations, even in highly salty samples, with a very simple 'mix and analyse' process,\" she said. \n\nThe researchers used the technique to analyse amino acids present in the salt-rich waters of Mono Lake in California. The lake's exceptionally high alkaline content makes it a challenging habitat for life, and an excellent stand-in for salty waters believed to be on Mars, or the ocean worlds of Saturn's moon Enceladus and Jupiter's moon Europa. The researchers were able to simultaneously analyse 17 different amino acids, which they are calling \"the Signature 17 standard.\" These amino acids were chosen for study because they are the most commonly found on Earth or elsewhere. \n\n\"Using our method, we are able to tell the difference between amino acids that come from non-living sources like meteorites versus amino acids that come from living organisms,\" said the project's principal investigator, Peter Willis of JPL. \n\nThe study was published in the journal Analytical Chemistry.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"NASA develops new test to detect signs of life on exoplanets","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNPY"],"sequenceId":"695203845985","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2016-11/01/full/1478010603-7261.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

In his monthly 'Mann ki Baat' broadcast, he underlined the need for students to relax by taking breaks from studies and rest properly and said that the memory's recall power is at its best when the mind is relaxed. He also asked students to chose 'anuspardha' (competing with self) over 'pratispardha' (competing with others) and cited the example of legendary batsman Sachin Tendulkar who kept challenging himself and bettered his records. Students, parents and teachers were the focus of Modi's 40-minute address as he noted that he found exams a source of concern for them wherever he went all these years and he always felt that they should come out of this \"strange psychological pressure\".\n\n\"Examination should be a source of happiness. It should be seen as an opportunity to highlight all the hard work you have done in a year. There should be enthusiasm and zest. It is your decision to treat as a pleasure or pressure. Those who treat it as a pleasure will gain and those who treat it as pressure will repent.\n\n\"My view is that examination is a celebration. Take it as if it is a festival. And when there is a festival or celebration, then the best comes out of us. We feel the society's strength during celebrations. Whatever is the best comes out... Smile more to score more,\" he said.\n\nHe gave the example of discipline seen among masses in 'kumbh' fair even though it is generally felt that there is a lot of indiscipline among people. \"This is the strength of celebration.\"\n\nDuring the examination, there should be a festive atmosphere among students, families and neighbours and it will convert this pressure into pleasure.\n\nHe also asked people to put examination in perspective and not treat it as \"a question of life and death or as a test of life but merely of the study students have put in during the year\".\n\nHe urged students not to chase marks but gain knowledge.\n\n\"Only studying for marks will lead to shortcuts and one will limit himself or herself. It is important to study for knowledge. Marks and mark sheet have a limited use. Knowledge, skill, self-confidence and commitment will be of use to you during life,\" Modi said.\n\nHe have the example of late President A P J Abdul Kalam's failure in an air force recruitment examination and said had he accepted it as a defeat, then India would not have got such a great scientist and President.\n\nHe also asked students to desist from resorting to shortcuts and cheating to score more.\n\n\"To cheat is to be cheap. It makes you a bad person. If you form a habit of cheating, there will be no desire to learn. Trying to cheat involves one's time to find ways. Use it for better purposes. People have told you often but I am saying again -- do not cheat. Even if no one catches you, you know that you have cheated in exams,\" he said.\n\nTurning his focus to parents, Modi said they should accept\n\ntheir children as they are and not burden them with expectations.\n\n\"There is a lot of discussion about the weight of students' school bag. It seems that the weight of parents' expectations is more. Expectation is at the root of problems while acceptance gives you an opportunity to improve things and look for new ways,\" he said, asking them to spend quality time with their children.\n\nUnderlining the need to avoid competing with others, he said it leads to jealousy, disappointment and complacency while if one competes with oneself it leads to stronger resolve, introspection and inspiration.\n\nHighlighting the need to play sports even as they prepare for exams, he said, \"Letter 'P' is for preparation and 'P' is also for play. The person who plays shines. Proper rest, adequate sleep and physical exercise should be there...\n\n\"A happy mind is the secret for a good mark sheet. When you are tense, knowledge takes a back seat. Do not let that happen.\"\n\nHe asked students to strike a balance between their mission and ambition, saying if they do it, good marks will follow them.\n\nThe burden of scoring good marks at times prevents them from taking the right path, he said, noting that people never inquire about how much marks a doctor or a lawyer has scored when they go to them.\n\nIn a lighter vein, Modi said parents and teachers may not like his emphasis on the need for relaxing and playing.\n\n\"Whatever I say, it does not mean that you keep sleeping or your family will blame me when the mark sheet comes... You should not allow whatever I have said to become a burden. Do it if possible or leave it.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"PM's advice to students: Smile more to score more; treat exams as festivals","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNPF"],"sequenceId":"695203846906","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:55:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2017-01/12/full/1484209692-4509.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Without funds for an attorney, I accepted deferred probation. It has followed me my entire life. \n \nI graduated from college, law, and graduate school, yet I had to endure a hearing to ascertain my fitness to practice. It also caused employment rejection. \n \nLater, as assistant county attorney in El Paso, and elected district attorney in Willacy County, I routinely dismissed pot cases. Prosecutor\u2019s offices have limited budgets, yet mountains of cases. Dismissing marijuana offenses, allowed me to send more dangerous criminals to prison. \n \nEven probation for pot was wasteful. Curfews and reporting requirements should be for prowlers and burglars, not pot smokers. \n \nThis problem persists, as 620,000 Americans were arrested for pot last year. Yes, illegal marijuana creates jobs for probation officers, prosecutors, bailiffs, chemists, clerical staff and many more; however taxpayers get soaked. \n \nCalifornia and three other states legalized marijuana on Nov. 8. Voters were persuaded by the Colorado experience, where $2.4 billion in revenues and 17,000 jobs were created in legalization\u2019s first year. Some of this boom comes from visiting Texans. \n \nThe Denver Post polled, \u201cWould you repeal legalization?\u201d The answer; \u201cNo\u201d, by a 51 percent to 36 percent margin. Gallup\u2019s 2016 poll showed support for legalization has grown to 60 percent nationally, and recent studies demonstrate no increased use among youngsters since legalization. Colorado is booming, and other states want what they\u2019re smoking. \n \nThe old \u201cReefer Madness\u201d arguments against marijuana have been dispelled. Today\u2019s legalization opponents such as Insys Therapeutics, which develops synthetic painkillers, poured $500,000 into the \u201cNo\u201d vote in Arizona. It\u2019s these legal painkillers which cause so much addiction and harm. \n \nPrescription drugs increase our health costs and Big Pharma doesn\u2019t want competition. The Catholic Church was also a huge contributor, with the Boston Archdiocese donating $850,000 to oppose Massachusetts\u2019 marijuana initiative. \n \nOne lingering anti-pot argument is that people will ingest and drive. This happens anyway and it will be illegal everywhere. \n \nNot satisfied, opponents wonder how they will test for marijuana. Field tests still work, but how about we just arm each officer with a chocolate bar, and they could cuff the stoned drivers as they grab for it. \n \nLegalization will come eventually, as it\u2019s only the oldest age groups who are opposed. \n \nAn estimated 15 million Americans use marijuana regularly, and about half our population has admitted trying marijuana. \n \nMarijuana decriminalization bills for the 2017 Texas Legislature, have been filed, including one by El Paso\u2019s own Joe Moody. \n \nRepublicans are increasingly in favor, because of the fiscal benefits and individual freedom arguments. Democrats are already there, and almost everyone wants to decrease the power of the violent drug cartels who smuggle pot across our border. \n \nLet\u2019s legalize it, and have Mexico put up the wall to keep Texans from trafficking marijuana into their country. \n \nEl Paso attorney Steve Fischer has been a professor of criminology and a Texas State Bar director.

It is also attempting to create its own state, which ISIS claims as a 'caliphate'. But there can be no accommodation or negotiation with it,\" Trump said in his executive order. \n\n\"For those reasons I am directing my administration to develop a comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS,\" he said. The plan to be submitted to the President within 30 days calls for a comprehensive strategy to defeat the ISIS and recommend changes to any US rules of engagement and other American policy restrictions that exceed the requirements of international law regarding the use of force against the terror group. \n\nTrump said the ISIS has engaged in a systematic campaign of persecution and extermination in those territories it enters or controls. \n\n\"If ISIS is left in power, the threat that it poses will only grow,\" he warned. \n\n\"We know it has attempted to develop chemical weapons capability. It continues to radicalise our own citizens, and its attacks against our allies and partners continue to mount.

whisky, and the US in bourbon Britain\u2019s prime minister is the first foreign leader to visit the new American president, Donald Trump. They have lots to discuss \u2013 international security, immigration, \"the special relationship\". There is also much talk of laying the ground for a US-UK trade deal.\n\nMuch of the talk of a trade deal, however, misses some of the fundamentals of what trade deals actually are and what they involve. They are agreements over the extent to which countries will agree the scale and scope of access to each other\u2019s markets. These may be reciprocal: \"We agree to trade in cars in both directions with a 10% tariff.\" Or they can be quotas, limiting the quantity or value of certain goods that can be traded. Alternatively they can be multi-faceted: \"We agree to have no restrictions on you exporting gin to us if we can export bourbon to you on the same terms.\" They are not, as most politicians seem to think: \"We agree to buy £100m worth of stuff from you if you buy £100m worth of stuff from us.\"\n\nSo why does the UK need these deals at all? It could simply have free trade with everyone \u2013 . In practice, this would mean offering other countries free access to its markets and hoping that they would reciprocate. Countries would only agree to this where they think it is in their interests \u2013 where they assume they will sell more to us than we will to them.\n\nIn this situation, comparative advantage dominates. This means that production (all those manufacturing jobs) gravitates to the location with the lowest costs. This is often politically unacceptable, as governments generally look to protect jobs and tax revenues, as well as to protect activities that fund innovation.\n\nThe difficult bit\n\nThis is why there is so much talk of trade deals going on. But the difficult part of a trade deal is not the negotiation itself; it\u2019s figuring out which industries will gain or lose from a given deal, and what the overall outcome will be, given the knock-on effect for various sectors of the economy. Equally, they must take into account how businesses will respond to a given agreement and what lobbying they will they do in advance.\n\nNegotiators are essentially like barristers that put forward arguments based on the analysis that they are given.\n\nA closer look at how the much vaunted UK-US \"trade deal\" would work shows what\u2019s really involved. In order to ascertain whether this will be \"good\" for the UK, you have to start with an understanding of what the nature of comparative advantage is between the UK and US \u2013 what is the UK better at than the US, and what is the US better at than the UK. Then you have to work out how this relates to goods and services that each wishes to trade.\n\nFor example, one could argue that the UK has comparative advantage in whisky, and the US in bourbon. But just because the imported products become cheaper after a reduction in tariffs, does that mean that the UK will actually import more bourbon and, if so, might that actually be bad for the Scotch whisky industry? Then it\u2019s necessary to work out the overall effect on each economy \u2013 by combining the comparative advantage for all sectors (from agriculture to pharmaceuticals), and work out if the deal is a good one.\n\nA lack of experts\n\nThe UK used to have \"sector experts\" who knew everything about their sector to figure this out. But it hasn\u2019t needed them for 25 years, as the EU has performed this role on the UK\u2019s behalf. As a result, the civil service has neither the capacity or the skills to fill this gap. Equally, many private sector firms had economics departments \u2013 Unilever, British American Tobacco, Ford among them \u2013 whose job it was to figure out what would happen to their sector if certain tariffs were agreed (or not). But neither the private nor public sectors have had those skills for a generation because they have not been needed.\n\nThe large professional service firms are circling to do the job \u2013 at £2,000 per person per day \u2013 but they are generalists.

Those 111 appearances have come over around four years, and he's failed to establish himself as a regular in Liverpool's starting XI under Klopp, with the German often preferring versatile playmaker Roberto Firmino in the central striking role. \n \nThe Reds boss has become frustrated with Sturridge's history of injuries and conceded that the England international simply doesn't play enough games for him to have a future under him at the club. \n \n\n \nKlopp is aware that, at his best, Sturridge is capable of being one of English football's most clinical goalscorers, but numerous fitness issues have clearly taken a toll on the 27-year-old, who now appears to be a shadow of the player he was two or three years ago. \n \nWith that said, the former Borussia Dortmund manager believes that the end of the season is the right time to let arguably his most talented and most recognised centre-forward go. \n Who would replace him?  \nKlopp would surely love a reunion with Dortmund hitman Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, although the deadly pace merchant is on the radar of giants like Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid . \n \n\n \nPromising Athletic Bilbao forward Inaki Williams is the name most often linked with a move to Anfield, while for Sturridge, it would be very difficult to find a club of the same size as Liverpool. \n \nEvery top side in England already seems to have a top-class striker, from Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Manchester United and Arsenal 's Alexis Sanchez to Chelsea's Diego Costa and Man City talisman Sergio Aguero. \n \nDo YOU think Klopp should sell Sturridge in the summer, or is it still too soon to say?

We have another away game then we have two home games. We are in the race and that's all we wanted.\" \n \nMeanwhile, Team Wellington produced an incredible fightback against Hamilton Wanderers in Hamilton on Sunday, coming from 2-1 down with 15 minutes to go to win 4-2. \n \nAndy Bevin scored the winner, sneaking in with a header at the back post, and then put the icing on the cake in stoppage time.  \n \n\u200b AT A GLANCE \n \nCanterbury United 4 (Stephen Hoyle 2, Andre de Jong, Jake Williams OG) Wellington Phoenix reserves 1 (Ruari Cahill-Fleury).

His shot from the edge of the box took a deflection off Phoenix defender Jacob Tratt to wrong-foot Glen Moss. \n \nThe only assistance Phoenix left back Doyle needed to score four minutes later was from Adelaide's left upright as his blistering shot from the edge of the box cannoned in off the post. \n \nThe pace of the game ebbed and flowed from there as the match required drinks breaks every 15 minutes. The Phoenix looked better coming out of the first break, but Adelaide grabbed the upper hand before and after the second. \n \nThat meant it was somewhat against the run of play when Krishna gave the Phoenix the lead in the 37th minute, just beating the offside trap to race away for a slick goal on the counter. \n \nBarbarouses should have put his side up by two before halftime when rounding Galekovic in his box, but didn't pull the trigger from a tight angle and didn't have any support to lay off to when he looked to play a pass. \n \nEven after that chance, it was tough on Adelaide to be trailing given their 15 first-half shots. Wellington were sloppy playing out of the back and only inaccurate Adelaide finishing meant the Phoenix's mistakes went unpunished.  \n \nThe Phoenix started brightly in the second half with Roly Bonevacia just unable to get a toe onto a Barbarouses cross within five minutes of the resumption. Ten minutes later Eugene Galekovic made a good save to deny the Dutchman. \n \nAdelaide looked to be struggling, but came back strongly in the final 20 minutes as Wellington wilted. \n \nTwice they squandered chances to equalise before Mileusnic finally drew his side level. Moss was only able to push a Ben Garuccio freekick onto his post, with Mileusnic on hand to bundle the ball across the line. \n \nAdelaide's Sergio Cirio will not look back fondly on this game. Twice in the final 20 minutes he had golden chances to score what would have been the winning goal, but both times he sent his shots from close range horrendously wide of the mark. \n \nThe Phoenix players would have been horrified to see the fourth official signal seven minutes of added time due to the drinks break, but somehow they held on for a point which sees them remain in seventh place, while Adelaide stay in last. \n \nAs for the hot conditions, the A-League heat policy doesn't go off everyday temperatures, rather it involves Wet Bulb Globe Temperature readings. That's meant to give a measure of comfort levels and was low enough to start the match. \n \nAT A GLANCE \n \nWellington Phoenix 2  (Tom Doyle 11', Roy Krishna 37') Adelaide United 2  (Riley McGree 7', Nikola Mileusnic 80'). HT: 2-1. \n \n ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"LIAM HYSLOP"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Phoenix succumb late in heat","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"The Press NZ","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"189987471","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"The Press NZ","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203853447","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.\n\nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.\n\nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government.\n\nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.\n\n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\"\n\nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.\n\n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said.\n\n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\"\n\nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. An has temporarily stopped the government from sending those who landed with valid visas out of the country.\n\nCrowds of protesters have gathered at US airports in response to the order and subsequent detainments.

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

I'm not going to stir the hornet's nest, but a number of other teams have had the opportunity to control where they've played this year.\"\n\nAnother sticking point is training.\n\nUnited can train throughout the week at McKellar for minimal cost, but would get limited access to Canberra Stadium.\n\nLast time the Mariners were in town, Canberra played its season opener against Melbourne City as part of a Canberra Stadium double-header, losing that game 2-1.\n\nThey were unable to train on the ground in the lead-up to that match.\n\nUnited co-captain Ellie Brush reiterated Dower's preference, but added they'd be ready regardless of where the game was.\n\n\"This is our favoured home, but ... we don't really mind where we suit up, we know the crowd will get out and support us. Just two more [wins] to go,\" she said.\n\nDower said Brush's fellow co-captain Michelle Heyman was unlikely to be ready for the semi, although she had returned to training with the main group as she continued her comeback from toe and ankle injuries.\n\nThe Matildas striker has been out since she rolled her ankle against the Melbourne Victory at the end of December.\n\n\"She was back training [Friday], which was a great sight to see her out here at McKellar juggling, jogging laps, kicking the ball around,\" Dower said.\n\n\"It was really great.

Lockheed Martin, the largest U.S. government contractor, is an American global aerospace, defense, security and advanced technologies company. G-PMC Group is accredited by the American Board of Accredited Certification (ABAC), the leading independent accreditation body in the United States at http://www.aboac.org \nAccording to Richard Milton, spokesman for G-PMC, the company's CEO, Daryl Guberman has been involved in a series of discussions with Lockheed Martin since questioning the aerospace giant's accreditation requirements for its suppliers, specifically for first tier and second tier contractors certified to ISO 9001:2015 and AS 9100 Rev C. standards. \n\nGuberman is no stranger to the aerospace industry. In 2013 he informed the FAA of quality issues plaguing the industry, particularly associated with the growing problem of supplier certification and accreditation. His letter can be found online at http://dguberman.com/Guberman_FAA_Flight_Safety_Letter.pdf \n\nHe is also the author of \"AS 9100 Systematic Failures,\" a deeply researched investigative report highlighting serious concerns with Locked Martin's F-35 Lighting II Program at http://dguberman.com/F-35-ISSUE.pdf \n\nGuberman challenged Lockheed Martin to improve their accreditation protocol, by asking the aerospace giant to recognize the many Veteran-owned and minority-owned businesses certified by G-PMC Group, as well as giving equal opportunity for accreditation bodies, registrars, and the thousands of American manufacturers and government contractors independent of ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB®) and/or its sister organization the International Accreditation Forum (IAF). Both organizations have the same individual listed in public records as Chairman and Vice President. \n\nGuberman's position on the matter prompted an internal investigation by Lockheed Martin involving two of its auditors that have allegedly misled a New York-based manufacturer and a Connecticut manufacturer concerning Lockheed Martin's accreditation requirements for its suppliers certified to quality management standards set forth by the International Organization for Standardization, including ISO 9001:2015 and AS9100 REV C certification. \n\nGuberman said by recognizing only accreditation bodies that are a member IAF, Lockheed would clearly be infringing on its own Code of Ethics regarding Fair Competition. The Lockheed Martin website affirms that \"Lockheed will conduct business in accordance with all applicable anti-trust or anti-competition laws and regulations, including those requiring avoidance of unlawfully restraining competition.\" \n\nAs the nation's largest government contractor Guberman believes Lockheed Martin is obligated to follow all anti-competition laws, including The Sherman Antitrust Act (Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1-7), a landmark federal statute in the history of United States antitrust law (or \"competition law\") passed by Congress in 1890. \n\n\"Antitrust laws and federal contractor requirements enable independently accredited certification bodies to issue ISO 9001:2015 and AS 9100 certificates to suppliers of Lockheed Martin and other defense contractors by affirming the same equal opportunity all certification and accreditation bodies, said Donald LaBelle, President of the Industrial Leaders Group which analyzes Federal contracts being investigated by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). \n\nHe added, \"If Lockheed Martin shuts out competition by colluding with a single accreditation body, and making it mandatory for its suppliers to be accredited by that sole entity, the massive defense contractor would risk losing a substantial amount of the $2.4 billion plus in defense contracts it receives annually from the Federal government.\" (Source: http://dguberman.com/lockheed_issues.pdf) \n\nGuberman said he appreciates Lockheed Martin for following anti-competition laws, and enforcing its policy on equal opportunity for independently accredited certification bodies. \"G-PMC Group and ABAC are proud of its supplier diversity programs, and its emphasis on certifying the quality management systems of companies that are Veteran-owned, Minority-Owned, and Woman-owned,\" said Guberman. \n\nG-PMC Group said it's reaching out to additional Lockheed Martin sub-contractors and prospective suppliers seeking to transfer their certification for ISO 9001:2015 (QMS), AS 9100 REV C (Aerospace), as well as VOB 9009 (Veteran-Owned), MOB 9009 (Minority-Owned-Business), WOB 9009 (Woman-Owned-Business) certifications. All certifications are fully accredited and internationally recognized. \n\nAbout G-PMC Group: \nG-PMC (http://www.g-pmc.com) is a registrar that carries a distinct accreditation and a distinct mission compared to the accepted norms in the world of quality. As one of the first ABAC™ accredited certification bodies, the company maintains the highest standards and practices to issue certifications.

Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. Qantas is offering refunds to any passengers travelling from Australia to the United States who are affected by a new entry ban. Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days. That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.\n\nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.\n\nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government.\n\nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.\n\n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\"\n\nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.\n\n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said.\n\n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\"\n\nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. An has temporarily stopped the government from sending those who landed with valid visas out of the country.\n\nCrowds of protesters have gathered at US airports in response to the order and subsequent detainments.

Orwell set his story in Oceania, one of three blocs or mega-states fighting over the globe in 1984. There has been a nuclear exchange, and the blocs seem to have agreed to perpetual conventional war, probably because constant warfare serves their shared interests in domestic control.\n\nOceania demands total subservience. It is a police state, with helicopters monitoring people\u2019s activities, even watching through their windows. But Orwell emphasizes it is the \"ThinkPol,\" the Thought Police, who really monitor the \"Proles,\" the lowest 85 percent of the population outside the party elite. The ThinkPol move invisibly among society seeking out, even encouraging, thoughtcrimes so they can make the perpetrators disappear for reprogramming.\n\nThe other main way the party elite, symbolized in the mustached figurehead Big Brother, encourage and police correct thought is through the technology of the Telescreen. These \"metal plaques\" transmit things like frightening video of enemy armies and of course the wisdom of Big Brother. But the Telescreen can see you, too. During mandatory morning exercise, the Telescreen not only shows a young, wiry trainer leading cardio, it can see if you are keeping up. Telescreens are everywhere: They are in every room of people\u2019s homes. At the office, people use them to do their jobs.\n\nThe story revolves around Winston Smith and Julia, who try to resist their government\u2019s overwhelming control over facts. Their act of rebellion? Trying to discover \"unofficial\" truth about the past, and recording unauthorized information in a diary. Winston works at the colossal Ministry of Truth, on which is emblazoned IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. His job is to erase politically inconvenient data from the public record. A party member falls out of favor? She never existed. Big Brother made a promise he could not fulfill? It never happened.\n\nBecause his job calls on him to research old newspapers and other records for the facts he has to \"unfact,\" Winston is especially adept at \"doublethink.\" Winston calls it being \"conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies\u2026 consciously to induce unconsciousness.\"\n\nOceania: The product of Orwell\u2019s experience\n\nOrwell\u2019s setting in \"1984\" is inspired by the way he foresaw the Cold War \u2013 a phrase he coined in 1945 \u2013 playing out. He wrote it just a few years after watching Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin carve up the world at the Tehran and Yalta conferences. The book is remarkably prescient about aspects of the Stalinist Soviet Union, East Germany and Maoist China.\n\nOrwell was a socialist. \"1984\" in part describes his fear that the democratic socialism in which he believed would be hijacked by authoritarian Stalinism. The novel grew out of his sharp observations of his world and the fact that Stalinists tried to kill him.\n\nIn 1936, a fascist-supported military coup threatened the democratically elected socialist majority in Spain. Orwell and other committed socialists from around the world, including Ernest Hemingway, volunteered to fight against the rightist rebels. Meanwhile, Hitler lent the rightists his air power while Stalin tried to take over the leftist Republican resistance. When Orwell and other volunteers defied these Stalinists, they moved to crush the opposition. Hunted, Orwell and his wife had to flee for their lives from Spain in 1937.\n\nBack in London during World War II, Orwell saw for himself how a liberal democracy and individuals committed to freedom could find themselves on a path toward Big Brother. He worked for the BBC writing what can only be described as \"propaganda\" aimed at an Indian audience. What he wrote was not exactly doublethink, but it was news and commentary with a slant to serve a political purpose. Orwell sought to convince Indians that their sons and resources were serving the greater good in the war. Having written things he believed were untrue, he quit the job after two years, disgusted with himself.\n\nImperialism itself disgusted him. As a young man in the 1920s, Orwell had served as a colonial police officer in Burma. In a distant foreshadowing of Big Brother\u2019s world, Orwell reviled the arbitrary and brutish role he took on in a colonial system. \"I hated it bitterly,\" he wrote. \"In a job like that you see the dirty work of Empire at close quarters. The wretched prisoners huddling in the stinking cages of the lock-ups, the gray, cowed faces of the long-term convicts\u2026\"\n\nOceania was a prescient product of a particular biography and particular moment when the Cold War was beginning. Naturally, then, today\u2019s world of \"alternative facts\" is quite different in ways that Orwell could not have imagined.\n\nBig Brother not required\n\nOrwell described a single-party system in which a tiny core of oligarchs, Oceania\u2019s \"inner party,\" control all information. This is their chief means of controlling power. In the U.S. today, information is wide open to those who can access the internet, at least 84 percent of Americans. And while the U.S. arguably might be an oligarchy, power exists somewhere in a scrum including the electorate, constitution, the courts, bureaucracies and, inevitably, money. In other words, unlike in Oceania, both information and power are diffuse in 2017 America.\n\nThose who study the decline in standards of evidence and reasoning in the U.S. electorate chiefly blame politicians\u2019 concerted efforts from the 1970s to discredit expertise, degrade trust in Congress and its members, even question the legitimacy of government itself. With those leaders, institutions and expertise delegitimized, the strategy has been to replace them with alternative authorities and realities.\n\nIn 2004, a senior White House adviser suggested a reporter belonged to the \"reality-based community,\" a sort of quaint minority of people who \"believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.\u2026 That\u2019s not the way the world really works anymore.\"\n\nOrwell could not have imagined the internet and its role in distributing alternative facts, nor that people would carry around Telescreens in their pockets in the form of smartphones. There is no Ministry of Truth distributing and policing information, and in a way everyone is Big Brother.\n\nIt seems less a situation that people are incapable of seeing through Big Brother\u2019s big lies, than they embrace \"alternative facts.\" Some researchers have found that when some people begin with a certain worldview \u2013 for example, that scientific experts and public officials are untrustworthy \u2013 they believe their misperceptions more strongly when given accurate conflicting information. In other words, arguing with facts can backfire. Having already decided what is more essentially true than the facts reported by experts or journalists, they seek confirmation in alternative facts and distribute them themselves via Facebook, no Big Brother required.\n\nIn Orwell\u2019s Oceania, there is no freedom to speak facts except those that are official. In 2017 America, at least among many of the powerful minority who selected its president, the more official the fact, the more dubious. For Winston, \"Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.\" For this powerful minority, freedom is the freedom to say two plus two make five.

Rookie Kai Sotto is slowly but surely making his presence felt for Ateneo. \n  \nTEAM STANDINGS \nAdamson 11-1 \nNU 10-2 \nFEU-Diliman 9-3 \nAteneo 7-5 \nUST 4-8 \nDLSZ 3-9 \nUPIS 3-9 \nUE 1-11 \n \nKai Sotto started his very first game for Ateneo de Manila High School on Saturday at the San Juan Arena. \n \nAnd the much-hyped rookie left an immediate impact that bodes well for the Blue Eaglets\u2019 present and future. \n \nThe six-foot-nine 14-year-old towered above all to pick off nine points, 13 rebounds, and three blocks as Ateneo made quick work of archrival De La Salle Zobel, 69-53, to snare the fourth and final playoff berth in the UAAP 79 Juniors Basketball Tournament. \n \nSotto, whose minutes have slowly but surely gone up through the tournament, held down the fort right from tip-off as the Eaglets blitzed the Junior Archers all the way to a 43-29 advantage by halftime. They wouldn\u2019t look back from that point. \n \nOf course, it was SJ Belangel who was at the forefront of the Ateneo attack and wound up with 19 points, nine rebounds, three assists, and three steals. Dave Ildefonso then chipped in a 15-point, 13-rebound double-double of his own in their team\u2019s seventh triumph in a dozen tries. \n \nEven with the win in the first game of the day, the Eaglets had to wait until afternoon to earn entry into the Final Four. \n \nNazareth School of National University made their wait worth it as it rallied by University of Sto. Tomas for a 72-59 decision. \n \nThe defending champions trailed by six after two quarters until John Lloyd Clemente got going and sparked a 24-point third quarter that took away the advantage in their favor. In the final frame, they just kept on rolling just as the Tiger Cubs ran out of gas. \n \nThe versatile forward finished with 19 points, all but five coming in the second half, to lift the Bullpups onto a 10-2 standing. They remain a game ahead for the second-seed and a game back for the first-seed. \n \nThe loss proved to be the death knell for UST\u2019s playoff hopes. Now standing at 4-8, they will not be able to catch up with Ateneo. \n \nMeanwhile, the first-seed still belongs to Adamson High School after it dominated University of the East, 93-68. \n \nEncho Serrano poured in 17 points while EJ Agbong pounded in 14 points and 15 rebounds as the Baby Falcons improved to 11-1. With one more win, they will secure a twice-to-beat advantage. \n \nStill in the running for that incentive is Far Eastern University-Diliman which bounced back big-time via a 99-75 triumph over University of the Philippines Integrated School. \n \nXyrus Torres scored 17 points and had five other teammates in double-digits in the Baby Tamaraws\u2019 ninth win in 12 games. \n \nTheir respective losses dropped the Junior Archers to 3-9, the Junior Maroons to 3-9, and the Junior Warriors to 1-11. \n \nBOX SCORES \n \nFIRST GAME \n \nATENEO 69 \u2013 Belangel 19, Ildefonso 15, Credo 13, Sotto 9, Escalona 5, Manuel 4, Berjay 2, Deonio 2, Gatmaytan 0, Flores 0, Espino 0, Angeles 0, Laud 0, Afable \n \nDLSZ 53 \u2013 Diaz 13, Sobrevega 11, Natividad 6, Santos 5, Cortez 4, Vista 3, Romero 2, Cosejo 2, Carlos 2, Vesagas 2, Laurente 2, Mariano 1, Terrado 0, Chavez 0, Damiles 0, Umali 0 \n \nQUARTER SCORES: 17-11, 43-29, 55-40, 69-53 \n \nFOURTH GAME \n \nNU 72 \u2013 Clemente 19, Amsali 12, Penano 12, Manalang 11, Sarip 8, Callejo 6, Malonzo 2, Fortea 2, Atienza 0, Coyoca 0, Mosqueda 0, Peralta 0, Tolentino 0 \n \nUST 59 \u2013 Cansino 21, Ratuiste 9, Narvasa 7, Dela Cruz 7, Fornillos 5, Balingit 5, Ballada 3, Baquial 2, Morales 0, Ian 0, Juan 0, Vince 0 \n \nQUARTER SCORES: 17-22, 26-32, 50-48, 72-59 \n \n--- \n \nFollow this writer on Twitter, @riegogogo.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"UAAP - BASKETBALL Blue Eaglets swoop into last playoff berth","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"PH","country":"Philippines"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ABS-CBN SPORTS","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"553774679","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4051"},"name":"ABS-CBN SPORTS","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://sports.abs-cbn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203885217","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Tomas Tigresses ripe enough to bring back their lost glory? \n  \nYears have passed and the University of Sto. Tomas Tigresses are still in search of the killer\u2019s instinct and fierceness that brought them success in the UAAP. \n \nSave for returning Pam Lastimosa, no other player in the current Tigresses roster has ever set foot at least in the Final Four in the collegiate level. \n \nIt's a goal that UST is looking to accomplish in UAAP Season 79 to end a five-year semis drought. \n \nThe Espana-based squad closed their previous campaign at sixth spot, a level lower than their finish in Season 79. \n \nBut with an almost intact lineup and new rising stars, UST is considered to be a top contender this year especially after undergoing extensive training and build up for the season. They are even in the radar to vie for the crown the Tigresses last held back in Season 72 during the time of now Adamson assistant coach Angeli Tabaquero and Aiza Maizo-Pontillas.   \n \nPower-hitting Cherry Rondina, who is taking the role as team captain, and Season 77 Rookie of the Year EJ Laure are back to power UST while Lastimosa will return to action to add stability and leadership inside the court \u2013 one thing the Tigresses missed last year when the former team captain had to skip the season due to a knee injury. \n \n\u201cSuper excited and a bit nervous siguro,\u201d said the graduating Lastimosa. \u201cIt\u2019s my last playing year and we should do good this year.\u201d \n \nOther holdovers Ria Meneses, Chlodia Cortez, Alexine Cabanos and rising star Carla Sandoval are all expected to shine this year to fill in the void left by the departure of Mela Tunay and Jessey De Leon.    \n \nUST hopes to ride the momentum of its UniGames conquest and decent finishes in a couple of V-League tournaments and apply the lessons the Tigresses learned in their Thailand training camp. \n \n\u201cCompared last year mas grabe ang inihanda namin this year kasi marami ang nagsasabi na may potential nga raw ang team this year for the Final Four,\u201d Lastimosa added. \u201c\u2019Yung V-League stint namin was really good, nag-fourth place finish kami sa Reinforced Conference. Nakakadagdag \u2018yun sa confidence ng team and nakita namin \u2018yung improvement na nangyari and kung ano ang dapat naming i-improve this coming UAAP.\u201d \n \nIndividually, the Tigresses has enough firepower to outgun the opposition. \n \nRondina and Laure played for Foton in the Philippine Superliga helping the team win the Grand Prix crown and a runner up finish in All-Filipino Conference. But the biggest exposure for the two were a stint in the Asian Women\u2019s Club Volleyball Championship where they showed great improvement in their game as they faced the powerhouse club teams in Asia.            \n \nCortez and Menese also saw action in the PSL while the team showed much potential in the V-League. \n \nThese things gave the Tigresses the confidence to do better this time that Rondina even revealed their ambitious goal.   \n \n\u201cFor me naman po, we really want na makabalik sa Finals,\u201d declared Rondina, who gave UST a beach volleyball title \u2013 her second in three years. \n \n\u201cSiyempre, kung gusto niyo malaman ang goal namin talaga, 'yun po talaga,\u201d she added. \u201cSiyempre, maganda na rin po ang makapasok sa Final Four, pero mas maganda po \u2018pag Finals. Tatrabahuhin namin. Hindi po kami mag-iiwan ng salita, basta trabaho, trabaho lang talaga.\u201d \n \nRondina and UST will be tested on February 4 against Season 78 runner up Ateneo de Manila University. \n \n--- \n \nFollow this writer on Twitter, @fromtheriles","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: volleyball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"UAAP - Volleyball UST Tigresses: Confident to hunt for glory","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"PH","country":"Philippines"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ABS-CBN SPORTS","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"553774679","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4051"},"name":"ABS-CBN SPORTS","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://sports.abs-cbn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203885382","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Andrews from The Villages stated that Russ Sloan needs a history lesson. No, it is Mr. Andrews that needs a lesson on our Constitution and the First Amendment.  \n \nIn the column by Russ Sloan regarding 49ers quarterback Colin Kaeperneck not standing for the National Anthem, Mr. Sloan pointed out that while Mr. Kaeperneck has the right to do that as an individual, that right does not exist if your employer, the 49ers, does not approve. First Amendment rights are not the same as an employee as they are as an individual. We have freedom of speech, but an employer can take action against an employee who uses vulgar or obscene language with a customer or coworker. Legally, Colin Kaeperneck does not have the right to protest standing for our National Anthem unless his employer approves. Russ Sloan simply pointed out that if he was the head football coach of the 49ers, he would privately let the ownership know that either Kaeperneck stands for the National Anthem or the 49ers can find a new coach or a new quarterback. \n \nIt is clear that Mr. Andrews does not fully understand the limits of the First Amendment as an individual versus as an employee. The ownership of the 49ers, for whatever reason, chose to tolerate Kaeperneck's disrespect of our National Anthem. Apparently Mr. Andrews feels the same way.

And it's easy today, as most modern smartphones are powerful enough to double up as really good handheld gaming devices. But there are times when we are stuck with poor internet connectivity and are unable to access our favourite games. In these situations, offline Android games are the way to go. \nWe have handpicked some of our favourite offline Android games. These are guaranteed to keep you engrossed, even when there's no network connectivity. \n\nTemple Run \nThe original Temple Run is one of the first titles that took the smartphone gaming world by storm. The game involves running endlessly while trying to avoid falling off a cliff or getting killed by traps and demons. Players can also collect coins and other items along the way. Given how popular it is, we may see a Temple Run-themed movie in the near future as well. \n\nSubway Surfers \n \n \nSimilar to Temple Run, the Kiloo-developed Subway Surfers is an endless runner and one of the most downloaded games on Android. Players have to keep running without getting caught by the cop who's chasing you. Along the way, they can also collect coins and unlock goodies like jetpacks and gifts. \nBadland \n\n\n \nBadland is a side scrolling action adventure game set in a dark forest. The forest appears beautiful, but there is something wrong with it. The player has to control a creature and find out what's going wrong. There are numerous traps and obstacles, and the game also offers a multiplayer mode with support for up to four players. It has 23 levels and offers an immersive gaming experience. \nFruit Ninja \nWant a good workout routine for your fingers? Look no further than Fruit Ninja. You need to slice all the fruits that appear on the screen by quickly running your finger across them. But you also have to be careful and avoid slicing the explosives that appear along with the fruits \nAsphalt 8: Airborne \nNo list of best offline mobile games can be considered complete without Asphalt 8: Airborne. Among the best racing games available on Android (and other platforms), Airborne's game play is similar to that of its predecessor. You are given four control options - Tilt to steer, Tilt and icons, On-screen controls and Tap to steer. However, the game consumes a lot of storage space and its frequent updates are equally big as well. \n\nLimbo \nLimbo is an interesting 2D puzzle game that can played offline. Players just need to use elements of the environment to solve the puzzles and move forward. Limbo has silhouetted and monochrome graphics that give it a sort of a creepy feel. Along with this, players also have to take care of things like electricity, bullets and water. \n\nMinecraft: Pocket Edition \nMinecraft: Pocket Edition offers a huge open world for creation and survival. The players can create new worlds and play in them offline. The creative or survival mode allows them to build and mine stuff, kill the bad guys and do lots of other cool things. The mobile version is not as immersive as the desktop one, but it's still enough to keep one glued even without internet connectivity. \n\n \nAlto's Adventure  \nThis is a side scrolling adventure game set against the backdrop of beautiful snowy mountains. The game is about the journey of Alto and his friends on a snowboard. On the way, they have to rescue and collect llamas, perform stunts, all while avoiding getting crashed. \nWorld of Goo   \nWorld of Goo is another puzzle game. Players just need to make bridges using bits of goo in order to make it to the end. The main challenge is that they must use the goo to its fullest potential to get across and earn a 3-star rating. The game offers a freestyle mode where players can build the tallest tower, with the results being stacked up against other players from across the world. \nSmash hit  \nSmash Hit is a first person running game where players have to throw balls to break obstacles in their way. The game has 50 different rooms and 11 styles. The catch is that the number of balls in the inventory also equate to total lives. The game requires focus, concentration and timing to not only travel as far as possible, but also break glass objects that stand in the way.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Gadgets Now Bureau"},"topics":[{"name":"Handhelds news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Android news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"}],"title":"10 cool Android games you can play \u2018without internet\u2019","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Gadgets Now","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"613374115","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"41"},"name":"Gadgets Now","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Games","Recreation","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gadgetsnow.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203886949","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The seed of the current United Nations was initiated during WWII as a united effort to defeat the Axis powers. The initial effort was led by U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin of the USSR \u2014 all allies at the time. The first use of the term \"United Nations\" was made in early January 1942 when 26 nations signed the original declaration. By early 1945 it had been signed by 25 more. On Oct. 24, 1945 the U.N. was officially formed. Flushed from the victory of the Allies over the Axis powers, the U.S. Senate and House voted unanimously in December of 1945 to see the permanent U.N. headquarters located in New York City. A major gift of $8.5 million was given by John D. Rockfeller, Jr. toward land acquisition. In January of 1951, the U.N. building was open for business, full of lofty ideals and noble goals. \n \nHowever, the foundation of the U.N. began with a serious fatal flaw as the original charter had to be ratified by the U.S., France, the United Kingdom, the Republic of China and the USSR. The USSR, an ally against Hitler, was led by a tyrant as ruthless as Hitler, Joseph Stalin, who soon showed his true colors by gaining control of the countries of eastern Europe, supposedly freed by Russian troops from Nazi control. Later, China would also internally fall to communism and its brutal dictator, Chairman Mao. Between the two tyrants, Stalin and Mao, millions and millions of their own people were murdered in order for them to maintain control. Both tyrants proved to largely undermine any real effectiveness of the U.N. during their lifetimes. \n \nAside from the U.N.'s efforts to fight against the invasion of South Korea by North Korea in 1950, primarily defended by U.S. forces and command, the U.N. has been sliding steadily downhill since, embroiled in multiple scandals and ineffectiveness. Because any one of the original five members of the Security Council (including the USSR and China) could veto and prevent any meaningful actions the Council might take, the U.N. was structurally doomed to be an ineffective force for good fighting evil. Evil was always present and could veto any worthy endeavor. That evil still exists, as does their veto. \n \nThe U.N. has grown to 193 member states/nations, many of which are dictatorships. It has become a hotbed for graft and corruption, largely unaccountable, and the U.S. taxpayers pick up close to 25 percent of the annual bill. There was proven to be a huge kickback scandal surrounding them, U.N.'s \"Oil-for-Food\" fiasco in Iraq, as well as the sickening U.N. sex scandals in the Congo uncovered in February of 2004. \n \nWhile no world war has transpired since the founding of the U.N., there have been 250 armed conflicts since 1945 \u2014 an average of four per year. The organization's history has also proven to be largely anti-Israel. The U.S. has been the leading protector of Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East. However, the recent vote by the U.S. to abstain from (instead of veto) a U.N. Security Council measure negatively affecting Israel has stunned Democrats, Republicans and Israel. It was an unforgivable act of betraying our best ally in the Middle East. In the last month of his presidency, and after the presidential election, President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry showed their true feelings. \n \nThe U.N has for decades been a feckless, corrupt organization with minimal accountability and integrity. We would be better off to exit the U.N. and create a new organization composed of democracies and member nations with a proven record of non-aggression and respect for basic human rights. The noble U.N. dream of 1945 never materialized and has become a 2017 geopolitical quagmire.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"International relations news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Sloan: The United Nations, from a dream to a quagmire","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lake","zipCode":"34749","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Leesburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Leesburg Daily Commercial","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169663137","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Leesburg Daily Commercial","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailycommercial.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203890345","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

After the success of its first game, Nguyen is back with another title that promises the same level of addiction, but slightly less impossible gameplay mechanics. \n \nNinja Spinki Challenges is far more polished than Flappy Bird, a game launched back in 2014, and, as mentioned earlier, less challenging to those who played and loved Nguyen's first game. \n \nThe new title is in fact a collection of six different games types , which is available on both the Android and iOS platforms. All six feature the same formula that made Flappy Bird so addictive: erratic controls, avoid obstacles. \n \nHowever, Nguyen adds a new element that seems to be the main theme of all six games: shooting stuff. Playing as a ninja rookie, you'll have to complete a series of challenges during a supposedly training session. Your main task is to hit various targets with a shuriken while avoiding cats and cannon fire. \n Choose endless mode for the ultimate Flappy Bird-like experience  \nTo make things slightly more difficult, the challenges are timed-based, so you will also be able to see how long you can survive the cats onslaught. As soon as you complete a challenge, an endless mode will unlock. \n \nDuring the endless mode , you can play as long as you want assuming you can survive the bouncing cats and cannon fire. Obviously, the longer you survive, the higher your score will be. \n \nAlthough the game starts easy, so that everyone can get a sense of the game's controls, Ninja Spinki Challenges becomes more difficult as you progress. \n \nIt's also worth mentioning that while the game is available for free, it does come with ads, but they are smartly implemented. So, if you fail a challenge, you can opt to continue from where the timer left off by watching a 15- or 30-second video ad. \n  \n  CHECK OUT THE GALLERY   (5 Images)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Mobile industry news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Wireless industry news","group":"Technology"}],"title":"Flappy Bird Developer Is Back with Yet Another Addictive Mobile Game","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"RO","country":"Romania"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Softpedia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658046","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"424"},"name":"Softpedia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.softpedia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203892576","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/fitted/340x180/flappy-bird-developer-is-back-with-yet-another-addictive-mobile-game.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

November also saw a double fatal on Highway 99 north of town. \n \nAll of the crashes occurred on two-lane highways. As we\u2019ve pointed out before, Chico is largest city in California that can\u2019t be accessed by a four-lane road. To get here you\u2019re going to have to drive 20 miles or more with cars zipping by in the other direction just a few feet away. \n \nThere\u2019s little margin for error, and with two oncoming vehicles\u2019 combined speed in excess of 100 mph, if one slips into the other\u2019s lane, the results are likely to be disastrous. \n \nWe\u2019re not expecting Caltrans to build a four-lane connector anytime soon, so it\u2019s hard to blame the roads. That small margin of error we mention requires an error, and it\u2019s not possible to engineer away recklessness, drunkenness or inattentiveness. \n \nOn Highway 32, Caltrans in recent years has rebuilt the bridge over Stony Creek and moved the dangerous intersection of River Road a 100 yards or so east to a much safer location. Left-turn pockets have been added and the road has been repaved and striped with markings that you can actually see at night. If you want to go back a few more years, the frighteningly narrow Gianella Bridge was replaced. \n \nWe\u2019re not sure what more can be done with asphalt and concrete, short of the expansion that\u2019s not realistic to expect \u2014 look at how long the planned four-lane artery from Chico to Sacramento has languished. Perhaps the oncoming lanes could be separated, but even that doesn\u2019t guarantee safety. \n \nIt\u2019s the same with Highway 99 north of town. Caltrans made improvements including rumble strips to tell drivers when they were leaving their lane, but again what more is there, unless the lanes could be physically separated? \n \nIt\u2019s hard to say that, as a couple of these crashes have reached into the newsroom at this newspaper, and they hurt. But you can\u2019t idiot-proof a road. \n \nOne thing that could be done is the Highway Patrol could dedicate a little more manpower to the state\u2019s two-lane highways, which have so much more potential to be deadly. Have a presence. Enforce the laws. \n \nAnd then, make the \u201ctraffic schools\u201d bad drivers use to clear their records less of a joke, figuratively and literally. How in heck do comedy traffic schools get approved by the state? Add a little rigor to that process and maybe some responsibility can be hammered into a few thick skulls. \n \n \nUltimately highway safety comes down to driver safety. We\u2019ve had callers and letter writers say they\u2019re afraid of the highways around Chico, and that\u2019s actually a good thing. Driving afraid is driving cautious, and the more cautious drivers on the road the better. \n \nBut the state has to go after the fools who aren\u2019t afraid, if the rest of us are to be safe.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Editorial: Bad drivers a worse problem than bad roads","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Butte","zipCode":"95966","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Oroville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ChicoER.com","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169657822","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"62"},"name":"ChicoER.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.chicoer.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203900193","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They have no water of their own, so they have to buy it from PG&E. They charge rates two to four times higher than the other two companies that serve Oroville.

The substation is the first of three that will support d3\u2019s innovative business partners as well as the events and activities hosted within this vibrant destination. \n \nThe first d3 substation will provide current and future power requirements for d3 with a total capacity of 178 megawatts (MW) to support lighting, district cooling, and general power requirements. The new station mirrors d3\u2019s unique design and enhances the creative environment provided to all visitors and partners. \n\u201cDEWA strives to achieve the directives of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to develop an integrated infrastructure for the energy sector, based on the highest standards of availability, reliability, efficiency, and safety. This has helped us achieve advanced results in the global competitiveness indices related to obtaining electricity. We continuously seek to improve our energy-related developmental plans and projects to meet the needs of customers, developers and other business sectors too. The construction of the first d3-132/11 kV substation is part of DEWA\u2019s efforts to achieve its vision to become a sustainable and innovative world-class utility,\u201d said HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, MD & CEO of DEWA. \n\u201cThe project is a first of its kind in the region, with plans to launch two more substations in d3 in the future. DEWA continuously works on developing its water and electricity infrastructure, and enhancing its services\u2019 reliability and efficiency by launching ambitious projects to actively increase our effective contribution to Dubai\u2019s economic growth and prosperity. We follow our strategic plan which is aligned with Dubai Plan 2021 to enhance Dubai\u2019s leading position as an international role model for electricity and water grid effectiveness and sufficiency, to meet Dubai\u2019s current and future demand,\u201d added Al Tayer. \n \n\u201cTECOM Group contributes to Dubai\u2019s economic development diversification, and we are proud to work closely with them. We are pleased to celebrate their success, and provide them with support in their new business destinations,\u201d concluded Al Tayer. \n\u201cDEWA has been one of the most prominent national entities to support Dubai\u2019s sustainable development, helping achieve the ambitious goals of Dubai Plan 2021.  DEWA exerts great efforts to support TECOM\u2019s business communities by supporting our strategic initiatives and qualitative services ensuring a distinguished infrastructure for our customers and visitors,\u201d said Dr. Amina Al Rustamani, CEO of TECOM Group. \n \n\u201cWe have a close relationship with DEWA and we share the same successes and strategic goals. Achieving the ambitions of Smart Dubai is a priority for us, as we are working hard to deploy distinctive smart services at d3, being the pilot development in achieving this promising vision,\u201d added Al Rustamani. \n \n\u201cWe are proud of our fruitful collaboration with DEWA to launch the first d3 substation. This is a constructive step to enhance d3 operations as per the highest quality and sustainability standard.

She replied, \u201cyes the (expletive) it is a gas you ignorant (expletive). sarin is a liquid & can evaporate ... shut the (expletive) up.\u201d \n \nTom Nichols, professor at the U.S. Naval War College and the Harvard Extension School, writing in The Chronicle Review, says such a \u201cstorm of outraged ego\u201d is an increasingly common phenomenon among students who, having been taught to regard themselves as peers of their teachers, \u201ctake correction as an insult.\u201d \n \nNichols relates this to myriad intellectual viruses thriving in academia. Carried by undereducated graduates, these viruses infect the nation\u2019s civic culture. \n \nSoon the results include the presidential megaphone being used to amplify facially preposterous assertions, e.g., that upward of 5 million illegal votes were cast in 2016. A presidential minion thinks this assertion is justified because it is the president\u2019s \u201clong-standing belief.\u201d \n \n\u201cCollege, in an earlier time,\u201d Nichols writes, \u201cwas supposed to be an uncomfortable experience because growth is always a challenge,\u201d replacing youthful simplicities with adult complexities. \n \nToday, college involves the \u201cpampering of students as customers,\u201d particularly by grade inflation in a context of declining academic rigor: A recent study showed \u201cA\u201d to be the most commonly awarded grade, 30 percent more frequent than in 1960. And a 2011 University of Chicago study found that 45 percent of students said that in the previous semester none of their courses required more than 20 pages of writing and 32 percent had no class that required more than 40 pages of reading in a week. \n \n\u201cUnearned praise and hollow successes,\u201d Nichols says, \u201cbuild a fragile arrogance in students that can lead them to lash out at the first teacher or employer who dispels that illusion, a habit that carries over into a resistance to believe anything inconvenient or challenging in adulthood.\u201d \n \nA habit no doubt intensified when adults in high places speak breezily of \u201calternative facts.\u201d \n \n\u201cRather than disabuse students of their intellectual solipsism,\u201d Nichols says, \u201cthe modern university reinforces it,\u201d producing students given to \u201ctaking offense at everything while believing anything.\u201d \n \nMany colleges and universities, competing for tuition dollars \u201ctoo often drawn thoughtlessly from an inexhaustible well of loans,\u201d market a \u201ccollege experience\u201d rather than an education. The experience \u201cturns into five and, increasingly, six (years).\u201d \n \n \nNichols notes that \u201cthe fragility of 21st-century students\u201d results from \u201cthe swaddling environment of the modern university\u201d that \u201cinfantilizes students\u201d who demand \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d and \u201csafe spaces.\u201d \n \nMuch attention has been given to the non-college-educated voters who rallied to Trump. Insufficient attention is given to the role of the college miseducated. They, too, are complicit in our current condition because they emerged from their expensive \u201ccollege experiences\u201d neither disposed nor able to conduct civil, informed arguments. They are thus disarmed when confronted by political people who consider evidence, data and reasoning to be mere conveniences and optional. \n \nFor all the talk in high places about emancipating the many from \u201cthe elites,\u201d political philosopher Walter Berns was right: The question always is not whether elites will govern but which elites will. And a republic\u2019s challenge is to increase the likelihood that the many will consent to governance by worthy elites. \n \nSo, how is our republic doing? \n \nWhat is most alarming about the president and his accomplices in the dissemination of factoids is not that they do not know this or that. And it is not that they do not know what they do not know. Rather, it is that they do not know what it is to know something. \n \nThe republican form of government rests on representation: The people do not decide issues, they decide who will decide. Who, that is, will conduct the deliberations that \u201crefine and enlarge\u201d public opinion (Madison, Federalist 10). This system of filtration is vitiated by a plebiscitary presidency, the occupant of which claims a direct, unmediated, almost mystical connection with \u201cthe people.\u201d \n \nSoon, presidential enablers, when challenged about their employer\u2019s promiscuous use of \u201calternative facts,\u201d will routinely use last week\u2019s \u201cjustification\u201d of the illegal voting factoid: It is the president\u2019s \u201clong-standing belief,\u201d so there. \n \nIn his intellectual solipsism, he, too, takes correction as an insult. He resembles many of his cultured despisers in the academy more than he or they realize. \n \nGeorge Will\u2019s syndicated column appears each Sunday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"George Will: An excess of intellectual emptiness","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Butte","zipCode":"95966","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Oroville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ChicoER.com","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169657822","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"62"},"name":"ChicoER.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.chicoer.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203904026","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:50:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

VIVA achieved these results due to the superior customer experience, high quality of services, innovative promotions and packages offered to its customers to meet their needs and expectations, inspired by our customers\u2019 confidence which motivates us to provide the best services with the highest possible quality. \n \nCommenting on announcing the annual financial results, Dr. Mahmoud Ahmed Abdulrahman, VIVA\u2019s Chairman, has stated that \u201cDespite the high competition witnessed in the Kuwaiti Telecom Market, VIVA was able to achieve growth in revenues, good profitability levels, in addition to sustain the operational efficiency that led to generating positive return to our shareholders during 2016. The witnessed growth in VIVA\u2019s revenues was a result of the approved business strategy to be one of the most developed telecom companies in Kuwait and the region. Also, our positive and pivotal role, as a pioneering telecom company, always contributes in providing smart telecommunications solutions to satisfy our customers aspirations and needs.\u201d \nHe added that \u201cVIVA has demonstrated its ability to achieve good level of profit amidst the current hard economic conditions and strong competition witnessed in the year 2016 which resulted from the decline in telecom tariffs thus pressurizing the profit margin of all telecom companies in Kuwait. VIVA has enhanced shareholders' equity base to stand at KWD 133 million at the end of 2016 with a growth rate of 43% compared to 2015. The Board of Directors has recommended distributing cash dividends of 10 fils among the shareholders representing 10 percent of the nominal share value for the year ended 2016 subject to the approval of the Ordinary General Assembly of the company.

This rise in awareness has resulted in a strong response from eager exhibitors for the World Food \u2013 one of eight specialist sectors in the newly evolved format of Gulfood 2017, which is taking place from 26 February to 2 March 2017 at the Dubai World Trade Centre (DWTC). \nOne trend seen across the globe is product knowledge and value, as consumers become more price conscious and increasingly mistrust brands, especially those from the largest global food manufacturers. \n \nThere is also a shift towards more \"authentic\u201d, niche and natural products, with people seeking brands that they see as upholding key values. In addition, a growing number of consumers trust organic products to be healthier, more natural and greener but also favour smaller niche food manufacturers over large food multinationals. \nThe Asia-Pacific and Middle East and Africa regions are the main global growth drivers of packaged food globally. \n \nNations from East to West, North to South have signed up to showcase country-specific products, services and business opportunities at the 22nd edition of the world\u2019s largest food and hospitality show, which will feature 120 national pavilions \n \n\u201cTransparency on sourcing is taking centre stage in the food-value chain and World Food recognises demand for nations to build brand-trust that is now paramount to consumers,\u201d said Trixie LohMirmand, Senior Vice President, Exhibitions & Events Management, DWTC. \n \n\u201cThe new sectorised format of the show will create better access for visitors to reach their target products and with World Food housed in its own dedicated sector, exhibitors will be able to offer greater insight into origin and source of their produce.\u201d \n \nSouth America is out in force at Gulfood 2017 with Minerva Foods, one of the continent\u2019s biggest players in the production and sale of fresh beef and its bi-products. With the Middle East and Africa so important to the company, representing 35 per cent of the company\u2019s international sales in the last twelve months ended in September 2016, the firm is now developing new, market-specific products, says Minerva Chief Commercial Operator, Iain Mars. \n \n\u201cWe have a plan with SALIC (Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Company) to address the food security issue in this region through a new distribution system focused on high-quality food supply,\u201d Mars said. \n \n\u201cThe Middle East region faces a lot of challenges, including the non-favourable climate and limited availability of water, as well as the political insecurity in some countries. Despite the influence of urbanisation, westernisation, population growth and better purchasing power contributing to an increase in regional meat consumption, the elevated cost of production has historically limited investments in meat production and created a higher dependency on imports. \n \n\u201cAll these factors increase the potential for South America to become the main supplier for the Middle East, exporting high-quality products with efficiency and at competitive prices. \n \n\u201cThe change in format can only help as the dedicated World Food sector will allow us to better showcase what we have to offer.\u201d \n \nMars is tipping Halal and organic foods to be the Middle East\u2019s premier growth sectors, adding: \u201cOrganic and grass-fed demand should increase following a shift in global behaviour towards lean and natural products.\u201d \n \nBrazilian interests at Gulfood will be boosted by the presence of the Arab Brazilian Chamber of Commerce, with spokesperson Michel Alaby citing the Arab world as the second major importer of Brazilian foodstuff after China ­- regional sales hit $8.68 billion in 2015. \n \nAlaby said: \u201cAmong the most important Brazilian foodstuff products exported to the Arab countries are meat, sugar, cereals, oil seeds, coffee, milk and fruits. Brazilian companies are developing their knowledge of the Arab countries and features such as the Halal certificates for, but not limited to, meat and its bi-products.\u201d  \n \nIreland, meanwhile, hopes a strong reputation in the provenance of its beef and poultry will boost regional sales, during Gulfood 2017.  A highlight of the Bord Bia Ireland pavilion will be the showcasing of the Golden Irish eggs brand, with the Emerald Isle\u2019s food board eager to leverage the country\u2019s product pedigree. \n \nGolden Irish spokesman Brian Eivers, said: \u201cWe\u2018re focused on offering customers a range of high-quality, 100 per cent Republic of Ireland BRC Grade A eggs. With a strong customer based across both retail and foodservice industries, we\u2019re well placed to service the needs of a growing market. \n \nThe brand, operating in the GCC since 2014, were the first to introduce Irish eggs to the market and are now moving into the supply of boiled and liquid egg to enhance their stronghold. The World Food sector at Gulfood 2017 will also see the launch of a new, bilingual Golden Irish Organic 10 Pack designed especially for the Middle East. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen significant growth in our organic offering and created this product to offer customers greater options,\u201d said Eivers, \u2018adding to our range of beautiful colour coded retail packs\u2019 \n \nIreland is eager to showcase its reputation for providing great quality food at the Bord Bia Ireland pavilion, this will be championed by dry-aged grass-fed beef producer John Stone Beef. \n \nAllan Morris, its Managing Director, said Ireland\u2019s standard, yet stand-out beef rearing processes gives it the edge with increasingly quality conscious consumers: \u201cOur beef is sourced from suckler farmers, which means the calves stay with their mothers to suckle until they are independent and can forage for themselves,\u201d Morris said. \u201cThis system is quite unique but is the normal standard in Ireland, ensuring sustainability and grassland management is achieved. \n \n\u201cAll Middle East countries are growing in terms of their desire for safe, sustainable and natural foods for their consumers. We are keen to show in the World Food segment why Ireland is well positioned to help them achieve this within their marketplaces.\u201d \n \nAt the show, John Stone will roll out a host of new products all falling in line with its strict Halal protocols. Morris added: \u201cWe are proud to say that we are the first meat company in Europe that has been granted the National Halal Mark. This mark is an assurance of quality and verification that the highest Halal standards have been achieved.\u201d \n \nThe dairy sector, meanwhile, is a key focus for Belgium\u2019s Flanders' Agricultural Marketing Board, which will have six dairies on show, under its White Gold from Europe banner. \n \nLatvia, making its fourth Gulfood foray, is fielding its largest national delegation to date, with 20 companies under the banner of the country\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture \u2013 up from seven producers three years ago. And the Latvians have high hopes of new business. \n \n\u201cOur aim is to cover all countries in the Middle East region and to introduce our high-quality and healthy products,\u201d explained ministry of agriculture spokesperson Daina Saktina. \u201cA high share of all Latvian products can be evaluated as eco and healthy-life products. We know that clients and customers from the region have high demands for food quality and we can satisfy these. We don\u2019t have many mass production companies with average products. We have smaller, diverse companies which prioritise quality, uniqueness and healthy life products.\u201d \n \nWorld Food is one of eight dedicated segments now housed within Gulfood to ensure buyers can more easily and effectively navigate the giant show. The other features are: beverages; dairy; fats & oils; health, wellness & free-from; pulses, grains & cereals; meat & poultry and Power Brands. \n \nGulfood 2017 is a trade event open strictly to business and trade visitors. The show is open 11am-7pm from February 26 to March 1 2017 and 11am-5pm on March 2 2017.

After spectacular goals lately, Lyon winger Mathieu Valbuena produced a contender for the French league\u2019s best miss when he fluffed an open goal as they lost at home to Lille 2-1 on Saturday.\n\nFollowing good work down the right from substitute Maxwell Cornet, the ball fizzed across the area and landed perfectly for Valbuena with no defenders around him. But he tried to smash it into the net from six meters out and it hit the crossbar.\n\nLille goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama made the noble gesture of comforting Valbuena, who buried his head in the net in disbelief at missing a chance to equalize with 20 minutes left.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t condemn someone because they miss a chance,\u201d Lyon coach Bruno Genesio said. \u201cEven though it was a huge one.\u201d\n\nValbuena\u2019s bad day got worse when he gave away the penalty that led to Lille\u2019s second goal in the 80th, dispatched by former Lyon striker Yassine Benzia, who then got into an argument with goalkeeper Anthony Lopes and midfielder Maxime Gonalons, his ex-teammates.\n\nThe Lyon crowd greeted Benzia\u2019s second goal with vitriolic chanting, but should perhaps have saved it for its own players.\n\nThe defeat left Lyon eight points behind third-place Paris Saint-Germain and four ahead of fifth-place Marseille, although Lyon has a game in hand.\n\nMemphis Depay made his full debut for Lyon after joining last week from Manchester United, but the winger did not make much of an impression, and neither did his teammates in a much-vaunted attack that scored 15 goals in the five previous matches.\n\nDepay came off midway through the second half and Cornet made far more of an impact.\n\nAlthough Lyon top-scorer Alexandre Lacazette netted his ninth goal in seven games with a late penalty \u2013 taking his league tally to 18 \u2013 he also missed a great chance for 2-2 when he drilled his shot just wide.\n\nIn the first half, Lyon struggled to break down a Lille side that kept its shape well and threatened on the counterattack. Benzia scored in the 38th minute with a deflected shot. He played more than 50 games for Lyon before joining Lille two years ago.\n\n\u201cOnce again we only played one half properly,\u201d said Genesio who, before the match, touted Lyon as a title contender. \u201cWe were invisible at the start. It\u2019s hard to explain why.\u201d\n\nOTHER MATCHES\n\nBordeaux moved up to sixth place after a 2-0 win away to Nancy, with 19-year-old striker Malcom getting the second goal.\n\nRennes needed a late equalizer from defender Joris Gnagnon to draw at home to Nantes 1-1.\n\nLast-place Lorient looked set for a much-needed win before conceding two late goals in a 3-2 home loss to Dijon.\n\nBut Angers moved away from the relegation zone after a 2-1 home win against Metz, which had two players sent off, while in the other match Corsican side Bastia drew with fellow struggler Caen 1-1.\n\nOn Sunday, PSG faces league leader Monaco in Paris and second-place Nice plays Guingamp.

Nearly a century after it was theorised, Harvard scientists claim to have succeeded in creating the rarest and potentially one of the most valuable materials on the planet \u2013 atomic metallic hydrogen. In addition to helping scientists answer fundamental questions about the nature of matter, the material is theorised to have a wide range of applications, including as a room-temperature superconductor.\n\n\u201cThis is the holy grail of high-pressure physics,\u201d said Professor Isaac Silvera from Harvard University in the US.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first-ever sample of metallic hydrogen on Earth, so when you\u2019re looking at it, you\u2019re looking at something that\u2019s never existed before,\u201d said Silvera. To create it, researchers squeezed a tiny hydrogen sample at 495 gigapascal, or more than 71.7 million pounds-per-square inch \u2013 greater than the pressure at the centre of the Earth. At those extreme pressures, solid molecular hydrogen breaks down and the tightly bound molecules dissociate to transform into atomic hydrogen, which is a metal, Silvera said. While the research offers an important new window into understanding the general properties of hydrogen, it also offers tantalising hints at potentially revolutionary new materials.\n\n\u201cOne prediction that\u2019s very important is metallic hydrogen is predicted to be meta-stable,\u201d Silvera said. \u201cThat means if you take the pressure off, it will stay metallic, similar to the way diamonds form from graphite under intense heat and pressure, but remains a diamond when that pressure and heat is removed,\u201d he said.\n\nUnderstanding whether the material is stable is important, Silvera said, because predictions suggest metallic hydrogen could act as a superconductor at room temperatures. \u201cThat would be revolutionary. As much as 15 per cent of energy is lost to dissipation during transmission, so if you could make wires from this material and use them in the electrical grid, it could change that story,\u201d he said. Also Read: Among the holy grails of physics, a room temperature superconductor could radically change our transportation system, making magnetic levitation of high-speed trains possible, as well as making electric cars more efficient and improving the performance of many electronic devices, said Ranga Dias, post-doctoral fellow at Harvard.\n\nThe material could also provide major improvements in energy production and storage \u2013 because superconductors have zero resistance energy could be stored by maintaining currents in superconducting coils, and then be used when needed.\n\nThough it has the potential to transform life on Earth, metallic hydrogen could also play a key role in helping humans explore the far reaches of space, as the most powerful rocket propellant yet discovered, researchers said. Read More: \u201cIt takes a tremendous amount of energy to make metallic hydrogen,\u201d Silvera said. \u201cAnd if you convert it back to molecular hydrogen, all that energy is released, so it would make it the most powerful rocket propellant known to man, and could revolutionise rocketry,\u201d he said.\n\nThe most powerful fuels in use today are characterised by a \u201cspecific impulse\u201d \u2013 a measure, in seconds, of how fast a propellant is fired from the back of a rocket \u2013 of 450 seconds. The specific impulse for metallic hydrogen, by comparison, is theorised to be 1,700 seconds. \u201cThat would easily allow you to explore the outer planets. We would be able to put rockets into orbit with only one stage, versus two, and could send up larger payloads, so it could be very important,\u201d Silvera said.\n\nTo create the new material, Silvera and Dias turned to one of the hardest materials on Earth \u2013 diamond. Rather than natural diamond, Silvera and Dias used two small pieces of carefully polished synthetic diamond which were then treated to make them even tougher and then mounted opposite each other in a device known as a diamond anvil cell. Also Read: \u201cDiamonds are polished with diamond powder, and that can gouge out carbon from the surface. When we looked at the diamond using atomic force microscopy, we found defects, which could cause it to weaken and break,\u201d Silvera said.\n\nThe solution, he said, was to use a reactive ion etching process to shave a tiny layer \u2013 just five microns thick, or about one-tenth of a human hair \u2013 from the diamond\u2019s surface. The diamonds were then coated with a thin layer of alumina to prevent the hydrogen from diffusing into their crystal structure and embrittling them.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Science.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"IE Online"},"topics":[{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"}],"title":"Atomic Metallic Hydrogen created claim scientists","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Indian Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660698","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"Indian Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnEzRlEVGZQWs1UDjVI3_8Q"],"sequenceId":"695203923792","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:25Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:25:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/hydrogen-metal-480.jpg?w=450"},{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/hydrogen-metal-480.jpg?w=480"}],"video":[]}}

Noting that India\u2019s spend on healthcare is much lower than some fellow BRICS and SAARC nations, a health body has asked the Centre to bolster investments in health, particularly in family planning, in the upcoming budget. Insisting that increasing the budget allocation for health and family planning is of \u201cutmost concern\u201d, Population Foundation of India (PFI) has said low spending by the country in the sector has caused growing inequities, insufficient access and poor quality of healthcare services. \u201cIndia spends just 1.3 per cent of its GDP on healthcare. This figure is much lower compared to BRICS countries \u2013 Brazil spends around 8.3 per cent, Russian Federation 7.1 per cent and South Africa around 8.8 per cent. \u201cAmong SAARC countries, Afghanistan spends 8.2 per cent, Maldives 13.7 per cent and Nepal 5.8 per cent. This low spending by India has been a cause for the growing inequities, insufficient access (to), and poor quality of healthcare services,\u201d Poonam Muttreja, Executive Director, PFI said. PFI said the 12th five year plan recommends increasing public expenditure on health to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2017. Between 2015-16 and 2016-17, the government\u2019s allocations for Health Ministry increased by 13 per cent but the share of National Health Mission in the Ministry\u2019s budget declined to 48 per cent.\n\nTrends in budget allocations indicate that percentage share to family planning has remained unchanged between 2013-14 and 2016-17 \u2014 at 2 per cent of the total Health Ministry\u2019s budget.\n\nNoting that during 2015-16, 59 per cent of government fund was released primarily in the last quarter while 72 per cent was released in the first two quarters in 2014-15, PFI said this evidences staggered supply of funds for health resources and affects investments.\n\n\u201cInvesting in health is critical for achieving the economic development goals. The health sector, which drives domestic demand for health care, has the potential of providing new jobs. The lack of skilled workforce is stark in the health sector. Increased investment will also bring down the prices of health services and assist in sustaining the medium term inflation target of four per cent.\n\n\u201cAdequate and proportionate resources invested (in health and specifically family planning) in the upcoming budget announcement will bear positive dividends for the country\u2019s future,\u201d Muttreja said.\n\nAccording to Census 2011, 53 per cent of the country\u2019s population is reproductive age group (15- 49 years) while one of five persons in the country is an adolescent (10-19 years) and every third is a young person (15-24 years).\n\n\u201cThere is a collective responsibility on the government, civil society and other stakeholders to work together to plan adequate and suitable opportunities to meet their needs and aspirations and address the health and well-being of this population,\u201d she said.\n\nPFI said that at the London Summit 2012, India committed to provide family planning services to an additional 48 million new users by 2020.\n\nTo fulfill our FP-2020 commitments and meet the responsibility towards the large young population, investments in health and family planning need to be proportionately increased.\n\n\u201cAccording to the FP-2020 progress report 2015-16, India has only reached 7.7 million additional users, by July 2016. Three million additional users have been reached last year, in contrast to 1.5 million additional users reached, each for the first three years.\n\n\u201cThe accelerated efforts of the government towards universal access to family planning are also evident in its introduction of three new spacing methods of contraception in the family planning programme\u2026 in 2015, offering greater choice and autonomy to the users of family planning,\u201d she said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Global news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Economics news","group":"Society"}],"title":"\u2018India spends less than BRICS, SAARC nations on health, should fix it in Budget\u2019","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Indian Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660698","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"Indian Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203923981","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:25:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/healthcare-main.jpg?w=820"},{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/healthcare-main.jpg?w=450"}],"video":[]}}

Child actor Sunny Pawar who made his debut in acclaimed Hollywood film Lion on Saturday said that he enjoyed shooting in Australian cities and developed a great bonding with his co-actor Dev Patel.\n\n\u201cAlthough we shot in Bhopal, Kolkata I loved shooting in Australia. The place was so beautiful. There were so many places to roam and play around, we went there after shooting and I loved the place,\u201d the young actor told IANS here.\n\nThe film Lion, an adaptation of the non-fiction book \u201cA Long Way Home\u201d, revolves around the story of a boy Saroo looking for his roots.\n\nWhile Dev Patel plays the lead character, Sunny played the young Saroo in the film.\n\nMore from the world of Entertainment: The young boy, who studies in class III at the Air India Modern School, Kalina and lives in a slum with his parents and two young siblings in Mumbai, went through an audition to bag the role.\n\n\u201cI went to the audition where they gave me some lines and asked me to tell them looking into the camera. I did that, and then I got to know that I am selected for the role,\u201d Sunny said.\n\nRecalling the first day of the shooting, he said, \u201cDirector sir just asked me to run and I ran! I did not feel any pressure of facing camera or shooting first time.\u201d\n\nWhile the film received six Oscar nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, Sunny Pawar already has bagged Grand Jury Prize (Special Mention) at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards and he is very thrilled about the fact that he walked the red carpet wearing a black suit like his \u201cnew friend\u201d Dev Patel at the Golden Globes in Los Angeles. As the shooting went on for more than a year, though he found it little tough to manage study and acting both, Sunny enjoyed the process throughout. \u201cMy teachers congratulate me and they encourage me to study. Though I want to act, I enjoy my studies too, especially mathematics as that is my favourite subject,\u201d said the young Ajay Devgn fan.\n\nSunny said, \u201cAfter the shooting I and Dev (Patel, actor) would play cricket and would goof around on the set. It was so much fun.

This has been in effect since 1 January 2016, although some of it only provisionally because ratification by the Netherlands is still outstanding. \n \n\u201cFirstly, the \u201cUkraine Model\u201d corresponds to the British objectives in that it contains substantial market access but does not require the application of EU law or compliance with the case law of the ECJ, nor does it provide for free movement but it does allow free trade agreements with third countries. Thus the United Kingdom\u2019s four key requirements are met.\u201d \n \nHere is the CEP\u2019s table, illustrating the benefits of a Ukraine-style deal: \n \nCentre for European Policy \n  \nThe think-tank does acknowledge that issues could arise with a Ukraine-style deal for the UK, particularly when it comes to the financial services sector \u2014 which has been one of the most contentious issues since the Brexit vote. \n \nBanks currently have the right to \u201cpassport\u201d their financial licences in one EU market to another, preventing them having to go through the costly and complicated process of being regulated in each market where they operate, but that passport could be lost after the Brexit process has been completed, causing chaos for Britain\u2019s financial services industry. \n \nRoughly  13,500 companies use financial passporting  in relation to the UK with all types of businesses from newspapers to removals companies, all the way to a body that represents acupuncturists holding passports. \n \n\u201cThe agreement with the Ukraine is unlikely to satisfy the United Kingdom as regards the scope of trade liberalisation because it contains numerous restrictions on market access particularly for cross-border services. The United Kingdom will probably require better access to the EU internal market, primarily in the interests of the British finance industry,\u201d the report notes. \n \nThat\u2019s where the \u201cPlus\u201d comes in, with the UK creating a bespoke deal that includes many of the features of the Ukrainian agreement, but also includes concessions to the banking and finance sectors. \n  NOW WATCH: Theresa May: \u2018No partial membership of EU\u2019   \n\n\n Please enable Javascript to watch this video","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Will Martin"},"topics":[{"name":"Eastern Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Ukraine news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"European Union news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"UK business news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Britain could strike a \u2018Ukraine Plus\u2019 style Brexit deal","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"MY","country":"Malaysia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"BusinessInsider.sg","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"536047637","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5142"},"name":"BusinessInsider.sg","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.businessinsider.sg"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cep.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/cep.eu/Studien/cepAdhoc_Brexit/cepAdhoc_Ukraine_Plus_as_a_model_for_Brexit.pdf","http://uk.businessinsider.com/morgan-stanley-on-brexit-uk-canada-plus-2017-1","http://uk.businessinsider.com/theresa-may-brexit-speech-leaving-single-market-immigration-control-2017-1","http://uk.businessinsider.com/brexit-eu-financial-passport-city-of-london-2016-11","http://www.businessinsider.com/theresa-may-britain-european-union-eu-hard-brexit-europe-2017-1"],"sequenceId":"695203927099","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:25:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico. \n \nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends. \n \nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long. \n \nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports. \n \nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader. \n \nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion. \n \nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups. \n \nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism. \n \n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

It is also in danger of dropping further behind in the fight for an automatic spot for the Champions League, as it was five points behind third-place Barcelona. The leaders play on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe won a point, which is more than we could have hoped for in this game,\u201d Simeone said. \u201cIt was not a good game in general. We need to improve.\u201d\n\nAtletico, which had won three in a row before enduring the two consecutive setbacks, was outplayed by Alaves during most of the match at Mendizorroza Stadium.\n\nThe host\u2019s best scoring chance was a close-range shot by defender Victor Laguardia that struck the crossbar in the 30th minute. Off the rebound, striker Deyverson missed the open net with a header.\n\nAtletico missed its best scoring opportunity in the second half, when Nicolas Gaitan broke free toward the goal but wasn\u2019t able to get a shot off as Alaves goalkeeper Fernando Pacheco charged from the net to snatch the ball away from the midfielder\u2019s feet in the 78th.\n\n\u201cWe leave with the feeling that we deserved more,\u201d Alaves coach Mauricio Pellegrino said. \u201cWe played a great match against a great rival.\u201d\n\nAtletico defender Jose Gimenez left the match early in the second half because of an apparent muscle injury.\n\nAlaves, winless in four matches, stayed 12th in the 20-team standings.

Sold as a debt-cleansing wellspring of revitalization, the deal increasingly resembles a rising tide that will lift a few select ships but drown the villagers caught in its undertow. About the only aspect of the sale of Scranton\u2019s last major asset that happened as advertised was the sale price, and even that came with a caveat. Pennsylvania American Water Co. paid $195 million for the sewer system and all its assets \u2014 which included $38 million in authority cash. At the Dec. 29 closing, the authority didn\u2019t have that much on hand, so $12 million of the sale proceeds went to pay the difference. Mayor Bill Courtright revealed this at the closing, but it remains unclear when he became aware of the situation, which contributed to the city receiving $30 million less than the $96 million Mr. Courtright promised. \u201cI don\u2019t see how he could keep saying, \u2018Everything\u2019s fine, we\u2019re still getting the same amount,\u2019\u2009\u201d Councilman Bill Gaughan said Friday. \u201cWe would ask, and he would say there was nothing to worry about.\u201d After speaking with Mr. Gaughan, I asked the mayor what he knew and when. \u201cIt was a very complicated deal that was changing on a weekly basis,\u201d he said. Mr. Courtright acknowledged that he was aware of the issue prior to the closing, \u201cbut I couldn\u2019t give you an exact date. I don\u2019t know how to answer that for you.\u201d Council was caught flatfooted when the city\u2019s share of the sale shrunk to about $70 million. About $17 million was placed in escrow \u2014 $12 million of which was set aside to address a lawsuit by Green Ridge residents who were surprised to learn that sewer lines snake beneath their properties and understandably rejected offers of $100 for easements. The best-case payout for the city is now $83 million, but there are no guarantees, and still no plan to deal with stormwater management costs. The authority once took care of stormwater management, but that job will now fall to Scranton and Dunmore. Taxpayers stand to get soaked, essentially paying two sewer fees \u2014 one to a corporation and another to the governments that pushed ahead with the sale with no plan for its aftermath. Mr. Courtright said the city and authority are exploring solutions to the stormwater challenge, which he hopes will not be as costly as many predict. Time will tell, but whatever the costs, they will be a further drain on the value of the sale. Drip, drip, drip ... Also unknown to the public is the cost of attorney and consultant fees related to the sale, and who has been or will be paid. Rumors of huge payouts have been circulating for weeks. On Jan. 10, council sent a letter to William Conaboy Jr. of Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, a law firm representing the authority in the sale. Among other items, it asks for a breakdown of how the $12 million in surplus cash was spent and an accounting of legal and consulting fees. \u201cIt seems like this information should be readily available,\u201d Mr. Gaughan said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we still don\u2019t have it.\u201d The Times-Tribune has filed Right to Know requests with the city and authority on these and other issues surrounding the sale. One recipient is the new executive director of the sewer authority, Jason Shrive. He left his post as Mr. Courtright\u2019s solicitor for the new $130,000-a-year gig, which includes the authority solicitor job. In fact, Mr. Shrive is the only employee of the authority. He succeeds former Executive Director Eugene Barrett, who, after the closing, went to work for Pennsylvania American Water Co. Yep. \u201cThis whole thing stinks,\u201d Mr. Gaughan said at Thursday\u2019s council meeting. \u201cThis arrangement is similar to the fox guarding the henhouse.\u201d He called Mr. Shrive\u2019s appointment a \u201cblatant cash grab paid for by the (sewer) ratepayers of this city.\u201d Not so, Mr. Shrive told me, dismissing the councilman\u2019s comments as election-year grandstanding. He said he\u2019s a good fit for the position because of his involvement in the sale. Aside from his salary, he said he has not been and will not be paid for his work on the sale. Mr. Courtright confirmed this, and both assured that all costs will eventually be accounted for and made public. In the meantime, Mr. Courtright said the sale was \u201ca good deal for the city\u201d and that critics should have proposed alternatives during the process, not after. \u201cWe had to do something,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anyone giving me a better idea. My question to them is, \u2018What would have happened if we did nothing?\u2019\u2009\u201d CHRIS KELLY is The Times-Tribune columnist.

President Trump signed the controversial executive order that halted refugees and residents from predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. (Photo by G. Morty Ortega/) \n  \n(CNN) \n \nMore protests against President Donald Trump's immigration policies are set for Sunday across the country after hundreds of demonstrators converged on airports the day before.. \n \nProtests are scheduled today in Washington, Orlando, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle, and Chicago, mostly at airports. \n \nThis is the second weekend of demonstrations, with more than 1 million people coming out last weekend for the Women's March. \n \nOlivia Katbi Smith told CNN affiliate KATU she showed up Saturday at Portland International Airport because she believes Trump's immigration policies are cruel. \n \n\"I think it's horrific and terrible and we are basically condemning people to death by not allowing them to come here,\" she said. \n \nShe said the event appeared to be impromptu. She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\"Mr. President, look at us,\" said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \"This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American.\" \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \"We are all immigrants!\" and \"No ban! No wall!\" \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \"What's happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\" \nAirport arrests \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \"President Trump's new Muslim ban.\" \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n \n\"This executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\" he said in a statement. \n \nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \"Portland coffee comes from Yemen,\" one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n \nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \"hashtag activist\" but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n \n\"This was the last straw,\" she said of Trump's policies. \"We're all immigrants.\" \n \nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n \nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey. \n \n© Distributed by LAKANA.

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

She cited Jeremy\u2019s \u201cunreasonable behaviour\u201d in her divorce petition. \n \nA month later, in January 2016, Jeremy attended the National Television Awards and spoke about life as a singleton. \n \nHe said finding new love wasn\u2019t on the agenda so soon after his marriage breakdown. \n \nHe said: \u201cKids and work \u2013 that\u2019s it. I promise you. Literally that. I\u2019ve thrown myself into work, that has kept me going. I appreciate all the support.\u201d \n \nHe also laughed off suggestions he could find love on online dating sites like Tinder. \n \nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t understand any of that. I\u2019m not on Twitter or any of that rubbish. I\u2019m an old man.\u201d \n \nLast February the couple were granted a quickie divorce during a hearing at the Central Family Court in High Holborn, Central London. Neither were present. \n \nJeremy and Carla were married in 2002.They met when she entered a competition called Two Strangers And A Wedding run by BRMB radio station in Birmingham, where Kyle was working. \n \nAs the winner, her prize was to marry a selected groom, called Greg Cordell. \n \nBut their marriage lasted just three months amid rumours Greg had had an affair \u2013 though he protested his innocence. \n \nCarla started dating Jeremy afterwards. \n \nThe TV presenter was previously married to Kirsty Rowley, who he met in 1988 when he was working as a recruitment consultant in Bristol. \n    Jeremy Kyle  (Photo: ITV)  Read More  \nThey wed in 1989, only to split a year later. They have a daughter called Harriet, 26. \n \nIn 2007 Kirsty told how their relationship had broken down because of a gambling habit he was battling with. \n \nShe said Jeremy had ­frittered away £70,000 and had previously run up £4,500 debts at the bookies and on betting phone lines. \n \nJeremy also spoke about the addiction \u2013 which he eventually overcame \u2013 in his 2009 book I\u2019m Only Being Honest. \n \nHe wrote: \u201cGambling is the mistress that truly seduced me. I will never understand what a hit of heroin feels like, but gambling I get. Big time. \n \n\"Plenty of days I can remember taking money out of the cashpoint and going to the bookies and then losing and going again to the cashpoint \u2013 and back again and again. \n \n\u201cI would think \u2018I\u2019ve got to go now\u2019 but there was this pull and suddenly I was chasing money, trying to achieve something that has never been achieved: making a bookie poor.\u201d \n \nIn 2012 he was diagnosed with testicular cancer but was given the all-clear after chemotherapy and surgery. \n \nAside from his daytime show, famed for its lie detector test and confrontational style, he has fronted dozens of programmes for ITV. In 2015 he presented two series of primetime show The Kyle Files. \n \nHe also presented a 10-part series called Jeremy Kyle\u2019s Emergency Room. The show returned in March 2016. \n \nAnd last year he also stood in for Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain. \n \nHe started his career on local radio before getting his break broadcasting on national station Virgin \u2013 presenting Jezza\u2019s Virgin Confessions every weeknight. \n \nIn 2004 he ran a similar Confessions Show on London\u2019s Capital FM. \n \nIt proved so popular he was poached by TV bosses and in 2007 The Jeremy Kyle Show began.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Photo: Splash News"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Jeremy Kyle finds love with his children's nanny after torment of marriage split","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"IE","country":"Ireland"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Irish Mirror","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"394142178","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"76"},"name":"Irish Mirror","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.irishmirror.ie"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-kyle","http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/divorce"],"sequenceId":"695203953536","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:25:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://i1.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9714196.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/PAY-PROD-MAIN-BPP_MDG_280117jeremykyle_1362JPG.jpg"},{"url":"http://i4.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9714196.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/PAY-PROD-MAIN-BPP_MDG_280117jeremykyle_1362JPG.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

They do not conform to PSL standards so the stadium can only accommodate day-time matches. \n\n\u201cThe municipality has committed to sort out the lights issue in the next financial year. Most of our home fixtures are played at night and Wolfson does not yet have PSL-standard lights,\u201d Mzinzi said. \n\n\u201cHowever, we are glad to announce that there are two games that we are taking to the stadium. \n\n\u201cThe Ajax Cape Town and Supersport United matches will be played at Wolfson later in the season. \n\n\u201cWe hope that those two games will draw numbers of spectators and also allow our people in the area to celebrate Chippa United.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Vuyokazi Nkanjeni"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Top soccer games to be played at Wolfson Stadium","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Herald Live","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"458677779","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"name":"Herald Live","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldlive.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203960975","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:16Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:25:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Even the architect of the \u201cAmerican Alliance\u201d, Tony McKeever, would not comment on a move which has the potential to put the cash-strapped EP Rugby Union back on its feet. \n\nMcKeever said that a \u201cnews blackout\u201d had been agreed by Schoninger and SA Rugby because of the sensitive nature of the talks. \n\nSaru spokesman Andy Colquhoun said they did not give a running commentary on their operations when asked about Schoninger\u2019s trip. \n\nHowever, bits and pieces about Schoninger\u2019s secret visit slowly started to leak out and this information showed just how serious the American was about sealing a deal. \n\nSchoninger also had an informal meeting at the invitation of Alexander at a braai at the Cullinan Hotel on Sunday. \n\nLast year Schoninger met Alexander in London, when talk of his interest in buying a stake in EP Rugby first surfaced. \n\nAlexander has said previously that the increase in private stakeholding in provincial unions had \u201cattracted a lot of interest both locally and abroad\u201d. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve asked them to hold off until we\u2019ve put the model in place but the guys want to talk now,\u201d Alexander said. \n\nAlthough SA Rugby and McKeever threw a veil of secrecy over the meetings with the liquidator, it is believed that a deal could be struck next week. \n\nOne of the liquidators, Danie Acker, confirmed that negotiations were under way with interested parties. \u201cI am currently not at liberty to give detailed information,\u201d Acker said. \n\n\u201cYes, we are talking to interested parties. \n\n\u201cWe are positive that a deal is possible, but I cannot disclose names or more than that. Hopefully we will be able to give more information by next week.\u201d \n\nInsiders said the terms and conditions of the acquisition of 74% of EP Rugby Pty Ltd and its commercial rights were discussed between Schoninger and the liquidator. \n\nSources said a sticking point to any deal, which will need Sanzaar approval, is that Schoninger wants the Kings entrenched in Super Rugby until 2020. \n\nHe also wants the EP Kings to be included in the top-flight Currie Cup Premier Division and not relegated to the lower First Division. \n\nBut it is believed that nobody could give Schoninger any guarantees about the future status of the Kings and this concerned him. \n\nSanzaar are only meeting in March to decide on the structure of Super Rugby beyond 2017, and this was probably the reason why an agreement was not signed while the American was still in town. \n\nSources said the plans for a Kings takeover were so advanced that new-look jerseys had been designed for the team to play in. \n\nThe Cape Town meetings took place less than four weeks before the Southern Kings play their opening Super Rugby match against the Jaguares in Port Elizabeth on February 25. Only last month, SA Rugby downplayed reports that Schoninger was interested in buying a stake in the Kings. \n\nNews of the American Alliance first broke on November 4 last year when it emerged that Schoninger had written a letter to SA Rugby chief executive Jurie Roux expressing his interest in EP Rugby. \n\nEarlier, Schoninger had applauded SA Rugby for increasing the private ownership stake in South African Super Rugby franchises to 74%. \n\nThis decision, taken last year, appeared to have boosted plans for a proposed American Alliance. \n\nWeekend Post is in possession of a letter Schoninger wrote to Roux in which he said a unique opportunity existed to form a strategic alliance between Saru, the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality and Pro Rugby North America. \n\nSchoninger flew back to New York on Tuesday and said he could not comment on the talks. \n\nBecause he could not get key guarantees, the American may be less bullish about sealing a deal than when he first landed in South Africa.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"George Byron"},"topics":[{"name":"South Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"More wheeling than in a scrum","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Herald Live","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"458677779","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"name":"Herald Live","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldlive.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203964235","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:17Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:25:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Having heard what the problem was, I urged the owners to bring their dog to the clinic since this was one of those cases where a house call simply would not provide the necessary medical care. So Tippy was duly brought to the clinic. \n \nTippy is a two-year-old female fawn chihuahua with bright boot-button eyes and a snappy temperament. But despite her sprightly behaviour, it was evident that Tippy was much too thin \u2013 thin enough that the shape of her skull had become clearly visible and her spine too prominent. A thorough physical examination also confirmed that although there was nothing immediately evident, she was uncomfortable in the abdominal area. \n \nFrom the initial discussion, I learnt that Tippy had not been herself for some time. She had become increasingly depressed and reluctant to play. More pertinently, she had been vomiting intermittently for the past three weeks, often just foamy yellow bile, and she had lost her appetite. Tippy had gastritis. \n \nCanine gastritis is an inflammation and irritation of the stomach in dogs, and is one of the most common ailments seen to by vets. Common symptoms include vomiting of whatever the dog has recently ingested or yellow foamy bile and sometimes yellow bile with flecks of blood that look like coffee grounds. In severe situations this can lead to diarrhoea, dehydration brought about because of the vomiting and/or diarrhoea, lethargy, depression, loss of appetite, weight loss, as well as tenderness in the abdominal area. If your pet dog is suffering from any these symptoms, one of the first questions that your vet will ask is how and when it started. Your answer will help the vet form an initial diagnosis, and in case of gastritis determine whether it is a case of acute or chronic gastritis. \n  Canine gastritis is an inflammation and irritation of the stomach in dogs, and is one of the most common ailments seen to by vets   \nAcute gastritis comes on suddenly and usually disappears after 24 to 48 hours. There are several causes. It\u2019s most commonly caused by drugs or other toxins, wrong diet, overfeeding or ingestion of too much grass. But dogs also tend to eat anything they chance upon, such as spoilt food, garbage, rotting carcasses, toxic plants, plants with pesticides, cleaning liquids, chemicals, foreign objects and even faeces. \n \nChronic gastritis tends to come on gradually, lasts more than seven days and manifests itself intermittently. Because of this, the cause for the gastritis may be harder to establish. The most common cause of chronic gastritis tends to be bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic infection in the gut. Stress can also be a contributing factor. \n \nSometimes the stomach can become irritated due to long-term exposure to allergens such as a food intolerance. All too often, well-meaning owners administer their own pain-killers which are either unsuited for dogs, or have too high a dosage and cause more harm than good.  Potentially fatal conditions include kidney or liver failure, cancer or some form of long-term toxicity. The bottom line is that chronic gastritis usually needs a more gradual process of diagnosis by elimination as one cause after the other is tested and discounted. \n \nThe best thing that you can do for your pet is to give as much information as possible and to continue with the follow-up sessions that your vet recommends. Sometimes, the nature of the case is such that the underlying cause for the gastritis remains unknown. In this case the gastritis is termed \u2018idiopathic\u2019, which means unknown, and the case is treated based on the evident symptoms. \n \nHaving diagnosed gastritis and depending upon the nature of the symptoms, your veterinarian may opt, to carry out blood tests, urinalysis, faecal analysis or take X-rays. Besides any immediate medication that may be needed, your pet\u2019s aftercare may include medications aimed to reduce the stomach lining irritation as well as directions on how to, reintroduce  food and water gradually until your dog is back to normal. If a food tolerance has been identified as the cause, your vet will recommend an alternative diet. If the gastritis was a direct result of your dog eating indigestible, rotten or toxic substances you need to remove the source of temptation or keep it on a leash when you take it for walks. Always follow your vet\u2019s advice and administer only prescribed medication. \n \nGastritis is invariably uncomfortable but, more often than not, there is good recovery even in cases where the cause is never established. Pet owners find that careful attention and good home management of their dog may reduce the incidences of gastritis. With Tippy, we are still at the initial stages of diagnosis and the first step taken was to reduce the pain and nausea so that she can start to feel better. With careful monitoring over the next few days, we may well discover what brought on her chronic gastritis. \n \n[email protected] \n \nDr Martin Debattista is a veterinary surgeon.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Martin Debattista"},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer: pets news","group":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Canine gastritis: upset stomach","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe","countryCode":"MT","country":"Malta"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Times of Malta","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660702","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"87"},"name":"Times of Malta","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.timesofmalta.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203970023","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:25:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Nothing could be further from the truth,' he told reporters in Melbourne. \n \n'People can talk about being hard, people like to think they're hard and tough, the fact is we have been hard, we have been tough and we've been consistently like that since I've been in this role.' \n \nMr Ashton said the state is dealing with unprecedented issues with violent youth crime, which he says are more complex than ever before. \n \nYouth offenders are also being charged with serious crimes for their first offence - which in the past traditionally wasn't the case, he added. \n \nHis comments come after a group of Victoria's former top cops said the state had lost its grip on law and order and police were soft. \n \nFormer chief commissioner Kel Glare, who ran the force from 1987-92, has joined with other former police chiefs to slam the state's response to the law and order 'crisis'. \n \nMr Glare's group, called the Community Advocacy Alliance, says modern policing is clearly not working. \n \n'We're being dismissed as dinosaurs that don't understand modern policing. But modern policing has got us to this point,' Mr Glare told 3AW on Sunday. \n \nThe group says policing has become 'risk averse' and chases need to happen. \n \n'In my view, in most instances, you have to chase,' Mr Glare told 3AW on Sunday. \n \n'There will be accidents and the community and the police will just have to accept that' \n \nMr Glare also says the Andrews government's new night courts won't work as, in many cases, it's the magistrates who make the 'bad bail decisions'. \n \nThe CAA has a 70-point plan, advocating for a police education program to be reintroduced to schools, police cars beefed up with nudge bars and a re- evaluation of juvenile offenders. \n \n'The crime rate in all the other states is going down and Victoria is going up - and most of that is being led by this rash of juvenile offending,' Mr Glare said. \n \n'These are young people but they're hardly juveniles and the definition of child needs to be amended.' \n \nThe state announced a police recruitment drive on Sunday that will bring an extra 3000 frontline police onto the state's streets. \n \nAAP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Police news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Crime and punishment news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Ashton vows police are tough on crime","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2059","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"North Sydney","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Sky News Australia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658630","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"25"},"name":"Sky News Australia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.skynews.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203971008","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:25:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Wildcats have won 66 of the last 67 games at home, but none featured a potential No. 1 NBA Draft pick. \n \nCollege basketball has seen several top-ranked teams upset in the past week including No. 10 Oregon losing to Colorado and No. 6 Florida State was upset by Syracuse on Saturday night. With more and more teams losing that are ranked above Arizona, it opens up room for the Wildcats to keep on climbing the national rankings. \n \nThe Washington Huskies are in Tucson Sunday afternoon hoping to join the list of spoilers. Washington is 9-11 on the season and 2-6 in the Pac-12. Looking at their record, it makes sense as to why Arizona is an 18 point favorite. But the Wildcats can\u2019t take this team lightly, especially when they have a potential No. 1 pick in the upcoming NBA Draft. \n  More from Zona Zealots   \nMarkelle Fultz is one of the best basketball players in the nation. Fultz is currently the leading scorer in the Pac-12 with 23.7 points, second in assists in the Pac-12 with 6.2 assists, and is also pulling in 6.0 rebounds per game. Against Arizona State, a game the Huskies lost, Fultz, put up 28 points, nine assists, and eight rebounds. \n \nFive times this year Fultz has scored over 30 points. Any success the Huskies have depends on how Fultz plays. According to ESPN, Fultz is the only player in the country who is averaging at least 20 points, six assists, and six rebounds. \n \nOther than Fultz, the Huskies don\u2019t pose much of a threat. Opposing teams are currently averaging 47 percent from the field in conference play. Their best defensive player is out with a finger injury, and no one has come in to help. Arizona should have no problem scoring inside and getting to the foul line. \n \nFor Arizona, Kadeem Allen will more than likely get the call to guard Fultz. Allen is the best defensive player for the Wildcats. His ability to block shots, steal the ball and get in the passing lane will be leaned on heavily. When he\u2019s not in the game, you can expect Kobi Simmons , and Rawle Alkins to all take their shot. Fultz will no doubt get his points, so Arizona will need to shut down everyone else. \n  \nJan 19, 2017; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Arizona Wildcats guard Kadeem Allen (5) shoots the ball as Southern California Trojans forward Charles Buggs (1) defends in the first half during a NCAA basketball at Galen Center. Arizona defeated USC 73-66. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports \n  \nLauri Markannen has risen to the top of elite players in college basketball. If he ever was an unknown, he for sure isn\u2019t anymore. No one on Washington can guard Lauri one-on-one, so he\u2019ll be able to get his shots up. \n \nThe Huskies will be more than likely lean on a zone defense and double-teaming Lauri when they get a chance. Markannen has handled pressure defense all year, so he shouldn\u2019t have any problem Sunday afternoon. \n \nThe problem Washington faces is they can\u2019t solely focus on Markannen. This team has weapons at each position. Kobi, Rawle, Dusan and Kadeem are all threats Washington has to worry about. On top of those players, they now have to worry about Allonzo Trier . \n \nIn his only two games of the year, Trier has scored 29 points, dished out 11 assists, grabbed six rebounds and only has two turnovers. Washington coach Romar believes Trier is the difference maker for the Wildcats moving forward. \n \n\u201cSometimes they would have scoring droughts, and I think Allonzo puts an end to all that. He\u2019s such a gifted scorer. So as good as they are, they\u2019re about to get better.\u201d \n \nOne player to keep a close eye on is Chance Comanche . He has been playing at a high level ever since conference play began. In the last two games, he is 9-10 from the field. His confidence is at an all-time high, and he\u2019s been a great spark off the bench. Chance has shown he\u2019s capable of scoring at the mid-range level, back to the basket and off the dribble. He should have an excellent opportunity to show off his growth. \n \nSo in a game where a team has far more weapons than the opponent, what does that team have to worry about? Well, there are a few things Arizona will need to do to have a comfortable win. \n  \nDec 3, 2016; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Arizona Wildcats forward Lauri Markkanen (10) blocks a shot by Gonzaga Bulldogs forward Killian Tillie (33) during the first half at Staples Center. Mandatory Credit: Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY Sports \n  \nKeys to the Game \n \nRebounds: Surprisingly Washington comes in with a higher rebounding average than Arizona. The Huskies are averaging 38.5 rebounds per game while Arizona is averaging 37.5. The Wildcats need to limit second chance points and multiple opportunities. To do this, they\u2019ll need to make their presence known on the glass. \n \nTurnovers: Even though the Huskies don\u2019t have much of a defensive threat now, they are still averaging higher steals per game than Arizona with 6.2. The close games where Arizona has struggled to pull ahead, it has been due to a high amount of turnovers. The last thing Arizona wants to do is give more opportunities for Fultz to get the ball in his hands. \n \nLimiting Markelle Fultz: As mentioned above, Fultz is going to get his points. Washington\u2019s offense revolves around Fultz and controlling the play. He will put up a lot of shots on the outside and take the ball to the hoop. If Arizona can keep Fultz under 30 points, the Wildcats should have a comfortable game. But if Fultz has a career day scoring, the game will be closer than expected. \n [embedded content]  Next:  T.J. McConnell Shining as a Starter in the NBA  \nSunday afternoon at 1:30 pm MST is the final game before Arizona heads up to face the Oregon schools. With a showdown in Eugene this coming week, you always worry about a young team looking ahead. The Wildcats can\u2019t afford to not take the Huskies seriously, but Arizona will be ready, and they will win comfortably.

Using data from the Health Resources and Services Administration about people living with HIV and served by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, we found reductions in disparities in viral suppression rates between 2010 and 2014\u2014with rates for Blacks/African Americans, adolescents and young adults, and people living in the South becoming more similar to rates for Whites, older adults, and people in other regions of the United States, respectively. Although absolute viral suppression rates for people without stable housing and transgender people improved during the same time period, disparities were not reduced between these groups and those with stable housing and nontransgender people, respectively. Addressing persistent disparities through the effective use of this program will be one of the key ways to meet the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Rupali K.

Marchers made their way to Capitol grounds Saturday morning carrying signs calling for the defunding of Planned Parenthood and for overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion across the country 44 years ago this week. \n \nSally Flowers, a participant visiting from Sugarland, said she hopes President Donald Trump continues establishing policies that \"protect life.\" \n \n\"I want him to pick a Supreme Court justice that will overturn Roe v. Wade,\" Flowers said. \n \nMarchers filed in to Capitol grounds around 2 p.m, after assembling several blocks away. State Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana, spoke to attendees and celebrated the implementation of the state's sonogram law, saying it has \"saved over 50,000 lives.\" \n \nThe Texas law requires doctors to perform a sonogram at least 24 hours before an abortion, display the sonogram images, make the heartbeat audible and provide a verbal explanation of the sonogram results to the woman. Doctors must also describe the medical risks of an abortion and determine the gestational age of the fetus. \n \nThe new administration, Cook said, gives him hope for the passage of more anti-abortion policies. In his first week in office Trump struck down what's known as the Mexico City policy, which prohibits U.S. agencies from funding organizations that perform or promote abortion services. \n \n\"The new administration might prove to be the most pro-life administration (in our lifetime),\" Cook said. \n  SHARE","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Mariana Alfaro"},"topics":[],"title":"Anti-abortion rally draws large crowd to Texas Capitol","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Gregg","zipCode":"75601","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Longview","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News-Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688030","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"254"},"name":"News-Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://news-journal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203988463","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:18:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:25:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If you've watched Cowspiracy , heard about Veganuary or even visited Clapham Common station , you'll be aware that eating vegan may be the best thing you can do for the environment. One report has even claimed that the meat industry could be responsible for 51% of global greenhouse gas emissions. But what are you supposed to do if you want to be good to the planet but can't face a life without cheeseburgers? \n \nThe first and most important thing is to really consider where our food comes from. Every day, we make hundreds of small choices about what we eat and each one has a huge effect on the environment. Before it even reaches our plate, food is raised or grown somewhere in the world, then clipped, shipped, refrigerated, processed, packaged, trucked, stored, sold and cooked. It might feel like the environmental impact of the food industry is beyond our control, but we can all be more mindful of what we put in our mouths and make it better not just for ourselves, but for the entire planet. \n  \n\n    \nPick the best ingredients \n \nLet's just agree that growing enough food for seven billion humans takes a lot out of our planet. We use over 70% of the world's water to grow our food, 37% of our landmass is devoted to feeding us and almost 30% of the global population is, one way or another, employed by agriculture. Meat and dairy are two of the most energy-inefficient food groups; for instance, it takes 255 litres of water to produce a glass of milk , compared to 27 litres of water for one cup of tea (black, of course). In general, fruit and vegetables require much less water \u2013 but even then, not all vegetables are good for the planet. \n \nUnfortunately, this includes the toast topper du jour: avocados. Greenpeace Mexico has warned that, due to our love of guacamole, Mexican drug cartels are taking over avocado production, terrorising local communities and forcing farmers to deforest land to grow avocados and use illegal chemicals on their fields. Even if your avos don't come from Mexico, their production involves a lot of water \u2013 it can take more than 1,000 litres to grow two medium avocados. \n \nAlmonds, too, require a crazy amount of water \u2013 over five litres per almond \u2013 and can only be grown in very specific environments, which are slowly being racked by drought. And that's before these tasty seeds (yep, we thought they were nuts, too) are shipped off to be processed into almond milk, packaged and shipped back around the world. A single gram of chocolate, meanwhile, uses over 170 litres of water. \n \nQuick and easy tip: \n \nSwitch avocados for lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber \n \nAvocados need so much water because they have evolved to grow in wet, tropical climates. It's possible to grow the same amount of equally delicious European veggies \u2013 like tomatoes, cucumber and lettuce \u2013 for less than one tenth of the water sucked up by the food blogger fave. \n Photo: Shanice Garcia  More   \n\n    \nAvoid processed food \n \nProcessed food has a bad reputation for what it does to your insides but have you ever thought about what it does to our environment? Generally, the further your food has travelled, the more energy and water it's used. The long list of ingredients means it probably has a pretty considerable carbon footprint. \n \nIf you cook your food from scratch, the environmental impact is easy to assess. Once grown, cleaned and shipped to store, you transport your ingredients to your home, prepare and cook them, then dispose of any leftovers or packaging. Walking to the shops or choosing an energy-efficient cooker will reduce this impact further. \n \nBut if you buy your food pre-processed or pre-cooked it becomes much trickier. Raw ingredients are usually frozen and shipped from all over the world to various factories, cut and cooked down before being packaged and shipped again to a depot. From there, they'll be transported to your local supermarket for you to chuck in your basket, take home and cook all over again. Generally, you have no control over where those ingredients come from, how energy-efficient those factories are or how much waste or pollution was created along the way. \n \nWe get it. When you're on the go, processed food can be a lifesaver \u2013 but if you have time to cook from scratch using fresh ingredients, you'll be so much greener. No matter how healthy processed food claims to be, fresh is usually better for you and better for the planet. Cutting out processed food could also drastically reduce your food packaging. \n \nQuick and easy tip: \n \nMake your own pasta sauce \n \nA simple jar of pasta sauce often contains a lot of processed ingredients, including modified ones like fructose and maize starch. Why not try one of these simple pasta dishes instead \u2013 you can even make them when your fridge is bare. \n Photo: Carissa Gan  More   \n\n    \nUnpackage \n \nYes, packaging! We all know the drill: less packaging = better for the environment. You might already be using canvas bags instead of plastic, but there is more that you can do. \n \nBefore you buy your food, check to see if the packaging is recyclable \u2013 not all of it will be, but these symbols will let you know what you can recycle, and what will have to go in the bin. Also, look to see how much packaging there is in total; boxes of loose teabags or tealeaves are greener than individually wrapped teabags, for example. Think about buying bigger packs of dry goods, as well. You can store most uncooked rice almost indefinitely , and one 2kg bag has far less packaging than four 500g bags (plus it's usually cheaper). \n \nWhere you can, though, avoid packaging full-stop. Look for fresh food sold loose rather than in packs \u2013 it uses less energy when being transported from field to factory. Buying your vegetables loose or your meat, fish and bread from the deli counters in supermarkets can really reduce the amount of packaging you take home, too. And if your nearest supermarket doesn't have a deli counter, try shopping locally. \n \nQuick and easy tip: \n \nTake inspiration from zero waste living \n \nBelieve it or not, some people \u2013 like TheZeroWasteGirl and ZeroWasteNerd \u2013 live a life virtually free from waste by reducing the packaging they consume. This is by no means quick or easy, but check out our guide to zero waste living and see how you can cut down your packaging, too. \n Photo: Lukas Budimaier  More   \n\n    \nEat local \n \nIf you're lucky enough to have a local greengrocer, fishmonger, baker or butcher, please try and shop there. Independent shops are sometimes a little more expensive than supermarkets but if you support them, they will support you back. Studies have found that small businesses may be better for the economy, community and of course the environment. If you shop close to home, you can avoid driving long distances and are more likely to buy produce that was grown or created locally. This is incredibly important. \n \nIn any UK supermarket you'll find food imported from countries like Vietnam, Peru and the Netherlands, which requires huge resources. In 2007, the Natural Resources Defense Council found that importing food was responsible for over 250,000 tons of global warming gases. That's the equivalent of almost two power plants. Before you buy, think about what it took to get that food to you. \n \nNot all food can be local, of course, but where you can, eating vegetables, meat, fish and grains grown or raised in the UK or Europe is good for the planet. If you have no choice but to shop at a supermarket, look out for the country of origin on the packaging and choose one close to home. \n \nQuick and easy tip: \n \nSubscribe to a local veg box \n \nIf you don't have a local greengrocer or can't easily get there, try subscribing to a veg box. Search online to find a fresh, local and often organic fruit and vegetable box that can be delivered straight to your door. \n Photo: Leonie Wise  More   \n\n    \nStop wasting your food \n \nFood waste happens all the time, all over the world. The World Resources Institute found that, between being grown and getting to your plate, about 25% of the world's food is lost or wasted. Often this is because food goes off during transport, because factories process food poorly or because supermarkets throw it away. WRAP says that the UK alone wastes 10 million tonnes of food each year, 60% of which could be avoided. If Europe stopped wasting food today, we could feed 200 million people. Eating local, unprocessed food can help \u2013 but the scary fact is, 70% of UK food waste happens in our own homes. \n \nPartly, this is down to packaging and supermarkets. Over half of the food we waste hasn't been used 'in time', including 17 billion portions of fresh produce. We've all done it \u2013 thrown away that surplus pepper when the stir fry recipe only calls for two. The easiest way to avoid doing this is to stop buying packs in the first place: if you need two peppers, buy two peppers. And if that seems like too much of a faff, have a regular check of your fridge. If you have food that's about to go off, cook it and freeze it. Love Food Hate Waste has tons of tips on how to use your leftovers. \n \nBut first, learn what 'gone off' actually means. 'Best before' dates, according to both the NHS and the Food Standards Agency, are simply an indication of when food will be at its freshest, not when you should throw it away. Both 'sell by' and 'display until' dates are added by the supermarket, not by an authority: store your food well and, even past these dates, if it's not mouldy or yeasty, it's probably fine to cook with or freeze. But pay attention to anything marked 'use by' \u2013 after this date, food may become contaminated with bugs like norovirus. Reducing waste is important but if food has passed its 'use by' date it could make you ill, so throw it away. \n \nIf you do need to throw food away, ask your council for a food waste bin and cut down on the amount of food waste in landfill. If all edible food waste in the UK was eaten or properly disposed of, it would reduce as much CO2 as taking a quarter of cars off the road. \n \nQuick and easy tip: \n \nLearn to love leftovers \n \nIt's easy to throw away an extra portion instead of saving it but cooked food can last three to four days when refrigerated, and will do nicely for a packed lunch. Check out our guide to see how long your leftovers will last. \n Photo: Elli O  More   \n\n    \nEat meat and fish, but better \n \nHere's what you don't want to hear: the meat industry is seriously damaging the planet. Factory farming has led to deforestation, vast greenhouse gas emissions, waste dumping and massive water consumption. But if you do eat meat (like 90% of the population), it is possible to make environmentally friendly choices. On top of everything we've already mentioned, the biggest things you can do are buy from small farms and eat the right kinds of meat. \n \nThe biggest environmental impact comes from factory farming so try to buy from small, sustainable farms, which usually treat their animals more kindly. If your meat is labelled 'pasture fed' or 'grass fed', the animals will eat naturally growing grass rather than grain, which has to be shipped to the farm. If you buy meat labelled 'organic', the farm won't have used chemical pesticides or fertilisers, which means less water pollution and chemical runoff. Shop at a butcher? Ask them which meat is farmed nearby and in the most environmentally friendly way. Some meats are kinder to the planet than others, too. The Good Fish Guide tells you what to buy to help fight overfishing, like choosing Pacific instead of Atlantic salmon. \n \nThe best thing a meat-eater can do to help the planet, though, is to cut out beef. Studies show that the carbon footprint of a meat-eater who avoids just beef is almost the same as a vegetarian's. The National Academy of Sciences in the US confirms that beef needs 28 times more land and produces five times more greenhouse gases than other meats. Being kind to the planet could be as easy as ordering chicken instead of beef. \n \nQuick and easy tip: \n \nBecome a flexitarian \n \nAll meat impacts the environment so if you can't give it up altogether, try Meat Free Mondays or only eating meat on the weekends \u2013 otherwise known as flexitarianism.

No. 3 Gonzaga dominated from tip to buzzer, crushing Pepperdine 96-49 in front of 3,104 Saturday at Firestone Fieldhouse. \n \nGonzaga put together one of its best efforts of the season in its last chance to impress voters before the polls come out on Monday. No. 1 Villanova and No. 2 Kansas lost earlier this week but the Jayhawks responded with a road win over Kentucky. Villanova entertains Virginia on Sunday. \n \n\u201cWe can control what we can control, our effort during games,\u201d said center Przemek Karnowski, who had 16 points on 8-of-11 shooting. \u201cPeople are there to take care of the polls, the seeding.

Silas Melson, who finished with 15 points, hit a putback to make it 43-21 at halftime. Pepperdine (6-16, 2-8) was within 18 early in the second half but the Zags hit the throttle again.

At present, the synonym \"bottled water\" refers to containers of various sizes that provide drinking water to consumers. The modern water bottling industry was launched in the 1960s when plastic was invented. However, the industry mostly flourished in the 1990s when polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic became available. Packaging and transportation of bottled water became more feasible with PET plastic, because of its light weight and strength. Today bottled water is a major global commodity, a $22 billion industry that ranges from very small local bottling operations to giant international corporations.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Tamim Younos"},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Younos: Bottled water:  Panacea or plague?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Roanoke City","zipCode":"24010","state":"Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Roanoke","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Roanoke Times","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169661434","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Roanoke Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.roanoke.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203994053","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:25:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/roanoke.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/48/e484fb9a-7c27-5836-9f4d-44653bf01e0c/576dabfbc4c5b.image.jpg?resize=503%2C559"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/roanoke.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/48/e484fb9a-7c27-5836-9f4d-44653bf01e0c/576dabfbc4c5b.image.jpg?resize=300%2C333"}],"video":[]}}

Hashmi said authorities have told him it was too early to speculate. \n \n\"None whatsoever right now,\" the center director said. \"We don't have any lead or information as to what started the fire and what happened. So I'm sure it's going to be a few days, they told us, before they can come up with any answers for us.\" \n \nThe congregation's pastor, known as an imam, was awake in the early morning hours and checked online surveillance of the mosque and found no alarm active and the doors unlocked, Hashmi said. On Jan. 21, someone broke in and stole some electronics, including laptops. \n \n\"He was worried about it and drove over there,\" Hashmi said. \"By that time, fire engines were already there pouring water on the fire.\" \n \nThe structure was built in 2000. \n \nNo injuries were reported. It took about four hours to extinguish the blaze. \n \nHashmi, who's lived in Victoria 32 years, said the congregation of about 140 has had few other problems and has enjoyed support from the city of about 115 miles southwest of Houston. He already has received offers of temporary quarters for the congregation to worship. \n \n\"When 9/11 happened, Muslims and non-Muslims, we all got together,\" he said. \"Of course, we will rebuild.\" \n \nThe Victoria Advocate on Saturday reported that in July 2013, a man admitted to painting \"H8,\" a computer shorthand for \"hate,\" on the outside of the building. \n \nOn Jan. 7, a mosque under construction near Lake Travis in Austin was burned to the ground. \n \nThe Texas office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said like that blaze, it would monitor the investigation of the Victoria fire. \n \n\"Because of growing anti-Muslim bigotry in our nation, and because of the recent spike in hate incidents targeting Islamic institutions and individuals, we urge investigators to keep the possibility of a bias motive for this fire in mind,\" CAIR-Houston Executive Director Mustafaa Carroll said. \n \nThere's been no determination yet for the Austin blaze, Diane Kanawati, with CAIR-Austin, said Saturday. \n \nIn December, a man was sentenced to four years in prison for setting fire to a Houston mosque where he worshipped. Gary Nathaniel Moore pleaded guilty to arson and using a fire as a deadly weapon in a Dec. 25, 2015, blaze that caused significant damage at the Islamic Society of Greater Houston mosque.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Austin news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Fire destroys Victoria mosque","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Gregg","zipCode":"75601","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Longview","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News-Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688030","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"254"},"name":"News-Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://news-journal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203995131","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:18:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:25:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Contest winners were announced and the presentation of awards by MAC President Jeff Lucas, was given to several artist-photographers. \n\nFirst Place honors were awarded to Mike Pillows for his work, \"Reflective Etching\". Pillows, who lives in Chatsworth, teaches 1st grade at Howard L. Emmons Elementary School in Pemberton. Pillows began his interest in photography before the digital revolution changed everything. His work in the dark room gave him a thorough understanding of the art form and all the technicalities associated with photography. Pillows award was $150. \n\nSecond Place was awarded to Karen Crisfulla for her entry, \"Floating Raindrops\". Crisfulla, of Medford, is a clinical nurse specialist at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. \n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t always recognize that photography is an art,\u201d Crisfulla said. Her artistic composition in black and white won her an award of $125. \n\nThird Place was awarded for \"Viaduct of My Dreams\" by Bob Damato. Honorable Mentions were given to Larry Lyons, Barbara Doreeste, Sara Ascalon, Mike Pillows and Crisfulla. \n\nHenry Rowan, a national award-winning photographer from Bucks County, the juror for the MAC competition, was unable to attend the opening. \n\nOver 70 photographs are on display at the MAC \u2013 the exhibit will run through Feb. 19.

It doesn't detail the other alleged attacks, but says some were recorded by the players, who shared them with friends. \n \nFifty-two assaults would dramatically increase the 17 reports of sexual and physical attacks involving 19 players since 2011 previously acknowledged by Baylor officials. \n \nThe school faces at least five lawsuits from women who allege they were attacked and the school failed to protect them or ignored their complaints. \n \nThe nation's largest Baptist university has been gripped by the ongoing scandal that led to the firing of football coach Art Briles and the departure of school President Ken Starr in 2016. \n \nAn internal investigation last year found that the football program operated as if it was \"above the rules\" and that assistant coaches and staff interfered or stifled investigations into alleged assaults by players. \n \nBaylor allowed Briles' staff of assistants to remain for the 2016 season but new coach Matt Rhule hasn't retained them. Some have moved to new jobs, including Briles' son and former offensive coordinator, Kendal Briles, to Florida Atlantic, and defensive coordinator Phil Bennett to Arizona State. \n \nIn a statement, Baylor President David E. Garland said the university had made \"great progress\" in fortifying security measures since the sexual assault scandal erupted last year. \n \n\"Baylor University has taken unprecedented actions that have been well-documented in response to the issue of past and alleged sexual assaults involving our campus community,\" Garland said. \"We have made great progress in implementing 105 recommendations to strengthen the safety and security of all students and restore faith in the university.\" \n \nThe statement did not specifically address the allegations in the new lawsuit. \n \nIn the lawsuit filed Friday, the woman alleges being raped by two players in 2013. The attack was reported to Waco police but no charges were filed and the players were allowed to stay on the team at the time. \n \nAccording to the lawsuit, campus officials didn't investigate her case until 2015. One of the players involved was suspended from the team and later expelled. The other had transferred.The lawsuit alleges the football program operated under a \"show'em a good time\" policy that \"used sex to sell\" Baylor to high school recruits.The woman was a member of a campus group called the Baylor Bruins that would host prospective athletes during visits. The lawsuit alleges Baylor encouraged making Baylor Bruins available for sex with recruits, as well as taking recruits to strip clubs, implied promises of sex and using alcohol and drugs in the recruiting process.Art Briles' attorney Ernest Cannon denied the program culture described in the lawsuit.\"If they were doing that it would be terrible, but they weren't doing that. Art wasn't involved in anything like that,\" Cannon said. \"Lawyers have great imaginations when money is involved.

Whether they will be allowed to continue to work remains unclear. Trump said this week he intends to reveal a proposal within a month. \n \n\"They shouldn't be very worried,\" Trump told ABC News this week. \"I do have a big heart. We're going to take care of everybody. ... Where you have great people that are here that have done a good job, they should be far less worried.\" \n \nTrump's delay and the tone of his remarks were a striking shift from his campaign rhetoric, in which he vowed to quickly end the program and labeled it amnesty. \n \n\"We will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties, in which he defied federal law and the constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants,\" Trump said in a major August speech on immigration. \n \nBut his new approach appears to be a concession to Republican leaders in Congress who have called for a less aggressive approach on an issue that has pushed some Latino voters away from the party. \n \nTrump's remarks this week aligned closely with comments from House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has repeatedly argued for a more compassionate approach to dealing with so-called Dreamers. Ryan has discussed the issue privately with the president and recently said congressional Republicans had been working with his team on a solution. \n \nDACA was arguably the most significant and high-profile change President Obama made to immigration policy, one he said he made only after Congress failed to enact broader immigration reform. The status of the immigrants, some of whom have little or no connection to the country where they were born, has been a focus of immigration advocates' anxiety and activism since Trump's election. \n \nThe program would be relatively simple for Trump to reverse. The policy does not require an executive order. \n \nAs of Friday afternoon, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services said that that it was still processing DACA-related work permits. \n \nTrump's White House is thought to be divided on the how to handle the issue. Those who have pushed Trump to embrace more restrictive immigration policies, including policy guru Stephen Miller, are said to prefer a more hard-line approach. On the other side are more those in the White House considered more moderate, including White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who said recently that the White House is planning to work with House and Senate leadership \"to get a long-term solution on that issue.\" Under a draft executive order first published by the news site Vox, the government would immediately halt processing new DACA applications, but would allow those who already have work permits to retain them until they expire sometime over the next two years. \n \nTrump faces pressure from hardliners in his party, including Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who has chafed at signals from top Trump aides that immigrants covered by DACA are not a priority for deportation. \n \nKing warned that Trump risks a backlash from his political base if he doesn't act swiftly \"because it was a clear and definitive promise that he made.\" \n \n\"And when you hear these kinds of statements coming out of the chief of staff and some of these statements that echo pretty closely out of the speaker of the House, it gives real pause to rule of law conservatives,\" he said. \n \nAdvocates both side of the issue now say they are expecting a compromise in which the president perhaps ends DACA and then works with Congress on a permanent solution that allows so-called Dreamers to stay in the country. \n \nMark Gonzales, the president of the Hispanic Action Network, said that Trump's actions this week have \"definitely shaken up our Hispanic community and the immigrant community in particular.\" But he said that he's confident from Trump and his aides' rhetoric that young immigrants currently protected by DACA don't have to be alarmed. \n \n\"He's making clear that even though they're going to repeal DAPA and DACA, the Dreamers are not the ones they're going to be coming after,\" said Gonzales. \"They're going to find a way to deal with the Dreamers in the way that is not deportation. That's good news to our ears.\" \n \nMark Krikorian, the executive director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for tighter restrictions on immigration, said that he's open to a compromise in which, for instance, those previously covered by DACA receive green cards in exchange for other concessions. \n \n\"Suspending DACA processing is an extremely simple, clear-cut thing. And if they haven't done it by now, there's some reason for it,\" said Krikorian. \n \nIn the meantime, young people covered by the program have been glued to their televisions anytime Trump takes action, said California attorney Sergio Garcia, who estimates he's handled more than 15,000 DACA applications. \n \nThere's \"a lot of anxiety, uncertainty of not knowing what tomorrow holds,\" he said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JILL COLVIN"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Trump and GOP search for solution for 'Dreamers'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Anoka","zipCode":"55432","state":"Minnesota","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Minneapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Minneapolis Star Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663279","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"11345"},"name":"Minneapolis Star Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.startribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204017352","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:25:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The band and Bure united on her show Fuller House , so there was no one better to introduce the band and kick off the show than D.J. Tanner herself. \n   New Kids On The Block Brought All The Right Stuff  \nNew Kids On The Block are one of the O.G. boybands, and after over 30 years of performing together, the guys still have  the right stuff .

The reasons were both poaching and accidental. \n \n \nOn Friday, January 27, a 20-year-old elephant died after coming into contact with an illegal electric fence around a field near Karnataka\u2019s Bandipur National Park. On January 25, a female elephant was killed due to electrocution in the forests of Odisha\u2019s Rourkela district. \n \n \n\u201cThe elephant climbed a small Bandha to reach out to the leaves, and touched the loosely hanging wire. We had informed the electricity department. Wires often hang loose due to the long distance between the electric poles in forests,\u201d Rourkela District Forest Officer Sanjeet Kumar told IANS on telephone. \n \n \nElectrocution is a method in which a wired trap or fence, mostly powered by a high tension electric line passing nearby in the forests, is used to kill the animals, either for poaching or to protect fields from herbivores. The wires with electric current are either placed on the preferred routes of the animals or passed through the water bodies used by animals. \n \n \nWildlife experts say instances of electrocution are on the rise and despite the 2005 guidelines of the Supreme Court\u2019s Central Empowered Committee (CEC) to the State Electricity Boards and Forest Departments to strengthened security to prevent poaching by electrocution, nothing much was done. \n \n \nAccording to Tito Joseph of the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), while every year at least 20 elephants die due to electrocution, at least 43 elephants were killed in 2016 in this manner. \n \n \n\u201cIn 2011, at least 11 leopards died due to electrocution and at least 10 wild tigers were poached,\u201d Joseph told IANS. \n \n \nTwo leopards, one tigress and two sambar deer were also electrocuted between January 11 and 14 in different forest divisions of Maharashtra\u2019s Nagpur district. \n \n \nOn January 25, a sloth bear was found electrocuted with its claws harvested, in Amravati Forest Division of Maharashtra, an official told IANS. \n \n \n(Kushagra Dixit can be reached at kushagra.d@ians.in) \n \n \n\u2013IANS \n \nkd/vm/tb/sac","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Nature news","group":"Science"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Electrocution of wild animals increasing, experts raise concerns","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"CA","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Can India News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"457869757","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"Can India News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.canindia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204021637","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:02:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:25:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She won 64 grand slam titles in total, including doubles and mixed doubles. \n \n\"I think she will break the record, and I think she will break it soon,\" Court said. \n \n\"It's so much easier for players today to do what they do. She hadn't played for about three months before coming here, and it easier to do these things. \n \n\"But she's playing very well, and records are made to be broken. \n \n   \n\"People keep asking me, 'How do you feel about your record?' but I'm not going to lose any sleep over something like that. \n \n\"My life is very busy and full, and they'll never get my 64 so it's all right. I'll always have that.\" \n \nCourt, who played from 1959 to 1975, watched Williams beat her sister Venus 6-4, 6-4 in the final and was again struck by the resources, support and equipment that players have access to. \n \n\"There was television in the early '60s but no sponsorship and money, none of that. Even the racquets they get to use today are so beautiful compared to what we used to have,\" she said. \n \n\"The facilities are so much better, they have massage people, they can bring psychologists with them as well as their trainers and coaches and whoever else they want to come along. \n \n\"It's a whole different era, so it's very hard to compare. I think back to our Aussie era where we had some of the greatest champions in the world and think, how did we ever do that?\" \n \nCourt has not had the chance to talk extensively with Williams, chatting to her briefly during a presentation at the 2016 Hopman Cup. \n \n\"It's like Fort Knox with the players today. They're so isolated and they're hard to talk to. It's not like when we played where everyone was like brother and sister, it's totally different. \n \n\"I thought it was a very interesting match that she played. I knew she was going to win but there was a lot of hitting up and down the court. \n \n\"We had so much more of an all-round game with the volleying. It's a totally different game now, but she has a wonderful serve. That gets her out of a lot of trouble, but she played very well.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Emma Quayle"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Australian Open 2017: Margaret Court says Serena Williams will take her record","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Sydney Morning Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587970","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Sydney Morning Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.smh.com.au/","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204025829","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:24:56Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:25:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The test encompassed several mystery shopping assessments and in-depth audits by industry experts, reviewing everything from responsible sourcing policies to menu diversification \u2013 and of course, customer service and the quality of the fish and chips being served.\n\nThe final stage of judging, held the day before the awards ceremony on January 26, put the shop's presentation skills to the test as they faced a 14-strong specialist industry judging panel \u2013 battling it out against the nine other regional finalists in a 'Dragons' Den' style pitch.\n\nCommenting on their award win after receiving the famous trophy from awards host, Nigel Barden, voice of food and drink on BBC Radio 2, shop co-owner Lesley Graves said: \"Winning the regional award for Eastern England was extremely exciting, but to come in second place and be one of the UK's top two fish and chip shops is an absolutely massive achievement.\n\n\"We've been entering the awards since 2013 and have been shortlisted for numerous accolades during that time, we were actually crowned the UK's best restaurant for 2015.\n\n\"This year we really stepped up to the next level, working not only to improve our business but to also positively impact the industry. With portion control high on the agenda we developed our very own 'Chip Scoop' to maximise the consistency of our serving sizes. We've also started working with Visit Lincoln to promote the city as a destination and grow tourism figures.\n\n\"It seems all the hard work has paid off and we couldn't be happier. We'd like to say thanks to all of our customers and staff for their unwavering support over the years, without you we wouldn't be where we are today.\"\n\nMarcus Coleman, chief executive at Seafish, added: \"The aim of the National Fish & Chip Awards has always been to showcase the very best fish and chip businesses and individuals in the UK while setting incredibly high standards for the industry.\n\n\"Every year Seafish sees new and more established talent vie for the top title. The judging process is extremely challenging with shops thoroughly being put through their paces, but Burton Road Chippy excelled across every aspect of running a successful business.\n\n\"They stood out for their enthusiasm, skill-set and sheer passion which were evident throughout the entire judging process. They're very worthy runners up and we wish them all the best in their future endeavours.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"James Peck"},"topics":[{"name":"England news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"It's official!

Johann Rhau-Grunenberg\u2019s operation in the town of a few thousand people on the Elbe River was small, but work was steady because of the new university that had been established in 1502. \n \nFaculty brought course materials to be printed for their students, and occasional books and pamphlets came off the presses. But after 1517, one professor in particular was a frequent visitor to the shop. He also was a writer, a monk and a preacher at the city church, and he tended to micro-manage the editing of his pages and even the look of the type and occasional illustrations. \n \nHe was Martin Luther, and almost entirely because of his ideas and his use of the relatively new printing industry, he turned the German town of Wittenberg into the center of European printing for much of the 16 th century. \n \nOf course, Luther was responsible for much more than that. We know him as the initial leader of the Protestant Reformation, the radical break of churches from the Roman Catholic establishment that spread quickly across Europe. That swift growth of the ideas of a little-known monk and his supporters came about because Luther understood how to use the revolutionary technology of the printing press, according to historian Andrew Pettegree, author of the 2015 book, \u201cBrand Luther: 1517, Printing, and the Making of the Reformation.\u201d \n \nMost scholars cite that year exactly five centuries ago as the start of the Reformation because on Oct. 31, 1517, a document Luther had written and that had been printed locally was posted on the door of the Wittenberg church. It was the famous \u201c95 Theses,\u201d his list of complaints about the church and the pope. \n \nNo one knows whether Luther himself nailed the document to the door, which served as a bulletin board for the university. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for faculty to post questions and comments, inviting others to debate them in public. \n \nIn this case, rather than the ideas being relegated to a one-time discussion, they were reprinted and circulated across Germany. They included concepts such as people reading the Bible for themselves rather than relying on clergy to feed it to them; salvation by faith alone; and the rejection of abuses in the Catholic Church such as the sale of indulgences, or pardons for sins. The ideas gained traction, and within a year or two, Luther was a nationwide celebrity. Pettegree, using modern terminology, writes that Luther now had his own \u201cbrand.\u201d \n \nLuther even had his own graphic artist to create a visual element for his message: Lucas Cranach, his Wittenberg neighbor who created portraits of Luther and drawings for his publications. \n \nThe new theology and views on church organization spawned a war of words between Luther and his opponents, both in public hearings and in pamphlets and books. Pettegree\u2019s research shows that from 1502 to 1516, Wittenberg printers published about eight books a year. From 1517 to 1546, the year Luther died, the city\u2019s printers published an average of 91 works a year \u2013 primarily because of the dynamic monk and the controversy he stirred. \n \nLuther was the 16 th century equivalent of a social media master. He surely would have used Twitter had it been invented, as his adversaries would have, too. In fact, some of the \u201c95 Theses\u201d would have fit nicely into 140 characters, such as No. 27: \u201cThey preach man-made doctrines who say that so soon as the coin jingles into the money-box, the soul flies out of purgatory,\u201d and No. 54: \u201cInjury is done to the Word of God when, in the same sermon, an equal or a longer time is spent on pardons than on the Word.\u201d \n \nHis cause ultimately succeeded, but in his day he had enemies as bitter as those opposing Donald Trump and his tweets today. \n \nEven when Luther\u2019s life was under threat and he was holed up in Wartburg Castle, he worked on translating the Bible into German with secret messengers delivering his manuscripts to the Wittenberg presses and returning proofs for him to correct. \n \nLuther again will be in the public eye in 2017 as travel agents promote visiting Wittenberg, Worms and other German cities on \u201cthe Luther trail,\u201d and more Luther books are published. \u201cChristianity Today\u201d magazine\u2019s January/February edition highlighted him on the cover with the blurb, \u201cHis Reformation Still Looks Pretty Great at 500.\u201d \n \nIn that magazine, Yale professor Bruce Gordon notes that Pettegree\u2019s book presents Luther as \u201cthe first media star of the printing age\u201d and quotes \u201cBrand Luther\u201d: \u201cPrint and public communication would never be the same again.\u201d \n \nNeither would western Christianity. \n \nMike Haynes taught journalism at Amarillo College from 1991 to 2016.

It\u2019s definitely 2017. But yes - I\u2019m reviewing an instamatic camera. \n \nThe Sofort is a metaphorical slap in the face to decades of digital progress; a completely analogue, almost completely manual compact that spits out your pictures on honest-to-goodness film every time you press the shutter. \n \nIt\u2019s also the least expensive Leica you\u2019re ever going to see. Forget splashing out thousands on bodies (and an equal amount on lenses) - you can snap up a Sofort for a relatively wallet-friendly £230. \n \nBut aside from providing lyrical inspiration to 90s UK indie popsters Babybird, what\u2019s the point in going instamatic? \n \nThe double-headed hydra of nostalgia and instant gratification, of course. \n    PRETTY AS A PICTURE    \nThe Sofort wasn\u2019t as slim and svelte as I was expecting, based on Leica\u2019s drool-worthy promo pics, but then I shouldn't have been too surprised. It's based on Fujifilm's Instax Mini 90, with only a few tweaks from the German camera company. \n \nIt\u2019s still a real looker, though, with a reassuring heft to it once you\u2019ve slapped in some film. \n \nWhite is probably the subtlest of the three colour choices, but nothing about this is subtle - which is why I went for mint green. There\u2019s also a bright orange, which is equally eye-catching. \n \nWhichever you go for, you\u2019re getting a chunky compact slab of camera, with a collapsing lens and only a few basic buttons to run your mitts over. \n \nAs well as the all-important shutter button up top, you get exposure compensation, a self-timer and flash control, as well as a button for toggling through the Sofort\u2019s shooting modes. You get the choice of standard, party, macro, sports, double-exposure and bulb, plus that most crucial of 21st century camera functions - a selfie mode. \n \nApart from the rechargeable battery, this is really the only concession for modern day photographers. There\u2019s even a little selfie mirror just above the lens, helping you line up your arms-length shots without wasting film. \n \nLeica reckons the rechargeable battery will last for 100 shots, so you\u2019ll probably have long emptied your wallet on replacement film before the camera runs out of charge. \n \nThe lens extends when you power the Sofort on, and has a focusing ring for switching between close-up and far shooting. A simple LCD screen shows which mode you\u2019re in, as well as how many shots are left in the camera, but that\u2019s pretty much it as far as electronic assistance goes. \n   Pictures in a Pop      A NEW DEVELOPMENT    \nPoint the lens-y end at your subject, look through the teensy tiny optical viewfinder, and hit the shutter button. That\u2019s really all there is to it. \n \nThe Sofort snaps a picture and then ejects your photo, accompanied by a satisfying soundtrack of mechanical whirring. Didn\u2019t your school teach you that \u201cSofort\" means \u201cInstant\u201d in German? \n \nIt\u2019ll take a couple of minutes for your pics to develop, though. Right out of the camera, they\u2019re completely white, but give it some time and they\u2019ll transform in front of your eyes. \n \nFocusing can be a bit hit-and-miss, even when you\u2019ve got the lens set to the right distance for your subject. Sometimes close-ups look great, and other times you\u2019re lacking any real detail. But then that\u2019s half the charm of instant film, right? \n \nYou\u2019re normally fine for landscapes and subjects more than 10 feet away, but you\u2019ll need to make sure there\u2019s enough light - the Sofort needs a lot of it to expose your shots well. The flash is an all-or-nothing deal, too. It's too weak for filling out night scenes, but too fierce for up-close portraits and selfies. \n \nSwapping out packs of film takes seconds - just flip the door release switch, tip out the old pack, and slot the new one in. The camera ejects a dummy print and you\u2019re good to go. Just remember it\u2019s at least a tenner every time you drop in a new set of ten prints. \n \nShutter bugs will find things get costly quick with a Sofort in their camera bag: a 10-shot pack of Leica's colour film costs £25, and monochrome will set you back £15. Fuji's Instax film costs less, so you can get 40 shots for around £30, or 75p a print. \n   ANALOGUE MEETS DIGITAL      PICTURE THIS    \nEach print is no bigger than a credit card, whether you opt for Leica\u2019s own film (in colour and monochrome flavours) or Fuji\u2019s Instax-mini film. I tested with a few packs of Leica\u2019s colour stock. \n \nEither way, you\u2019ve got to manage your expectations when it comes to quality. \n \nMost of my shots had enough clarity, with rich, vibrant colours that you just can\u2019t get from a digital camera. Well, without slapping a load of photo filters on afterwards in editing, anyway. \n \nThat\u2019s only if you\u2019ve fed it enough light, though. A lot of times I thought a subject was well-lit, but the resulting print was mostly dark. The bulb mode is handy if you\u2019ve got a tripod, as you can pull of some pretty decent long exposures, but there\u2019s no cold shoe for adding a more powerful flash. \n \nI loved the double exposure mode, which creates ethereal dreamscapes from simple shots. You\u2019ve got to have a good eye to get great results, too - there\u2019s no digital magic overlaying your shots before you press the shutter button here. \n \nSometimes, though, you just won\u2019t have got the shot you were hoping for. The perils of instant film: either you got the exposure wrong, or the flash didn\u2019t quite do what you were expecting. The results can either look washed out, or too dark to make out any details. \n \nIt\u2019s here you\u2019ve just got to suck it up and try again, learning from your mistakes. Which might sound bizarre to anyone that\u2019s only ever shot on digital, but I love that all-or-nothing attitude that died out when film cameras took a back seat to modern technology. \n \nIf clarity is all you\u2019re after, there are instant alternatives out there that just edge out the Sofort. Polaroid\u2019s Snap Touch might use a digital sensor and zero-ink printing instead of classic film, but there\u2019s no question it crams in more detail into every shot. \n   MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD Verdict     \nThe Sofort is simple, takes alright instant photos, and owning one won\u2019t force you to take out a second mortgage. \n \nLet\u2019s be honest, this is the closest I\u2019m ever going to get to actually owning a camera with that fabled Red Dot on it. Tech journalists aren\u2019t really part of Leica\u2019s regular customer base. \n \nIs that enough to see past the Sofort\u2019s limits, though? For me, yeah, it probably is - I\u2019m just that much of a logo snob. \n \nFor everyone else, though, this is a camera you\u2019ll have fun using, but the Fujifilm Instax it is based on will be the better, cheaper buy. \n      Tech Specs      FILM COMPATIBILITY   Instax-mini (Leica, Fujifilm)     BATTERY LIFE      DIMENSIONS   124x94x58mm, 305g        Stuff says...    Leica Sofort review It\u2019s got gorgeous looks and oozes retro appeal, but you\u2019re paying for the name.

He didn\u2019t ask for your votes and he doesn\u2019t deserve your social media disparagement or approval.\n\nHe\u2019s 10 years old. Leave him out of it.\n\nThat message, one that shouldn\u2019t have had to be given, finally sank through last weekend after there was a groundswell of indignation over a slew of Inauguration Day tweets that targeted President Donald Trump\u2019s youngest child, Barron.\n\n\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d comedy writer Katie Rich felt the wrath after she tweeted Barron \u201cwill be this country\u2019s first homeschool shooter.\u201d More than 79,000 people signed a petition urging she be fired from her job; SNL suspended her; and Rich finally issued an apology saying she regretted her actions and offensive words and that they were inexcusable.\n\nIndeed they were.\n\nComedy Central contributor Stephen Spinola added his tweet to the Barron-bashing, calling the boy a \u201cvery handsome date rapist-to-be.\u201d He, too, soon saw the light after a flood of criticism and issued an apology.\n\nThis is not the first time that young Trump has been disparaged via social media. Last fall, comedienne Rosie O\u2019Donnell slipped off the rails when she suggested Barron might be suffering from autism and posted \u2013 as \u201cproof\u201d\u2014a video of an obviously tired young Barron yawning and being inexpressive after his father\u2019s late night victory speech in November.\n\nO\u2019Donnell came to her senses after Melania Trump threatened legal action and she promptly apologized and set her account to private.\n\nNor were attacks on children limited to social media in the rancorous presidential political campaigns. The Washington Post violated the unwritten \u201cchildren are off limits\u201d rule when it ran a political cartoon denigrating Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who was surging in the GOP polls. The cartoon depicted Cruz as an organ grinder and his then 5- and 7-year-old daughters as monkeys on a leash. All because they had appeared with their father in a pre-Christmas political ad.\n\nThe Post pulled the cartoon after it, similarly, was the target of outraged backlash.\n\nThe rancor and nasty partisanship that more frequently accompanies political campaigns is no excuse. Neither is the rise of Twitter and other social media that offer the opportunity to comment and criticize instantly and send it to thousands of people.\n\nDonald Trump has used Twitter to great effect in his run to the presidency \u2014 and he is no stranger to the use of harsh words in disparaging detractors and sharing his thoughts.\n\nHe can dish it out and he can take criticism or praise for his actions \u2014 he is fair game for both of those things.\n\nHis son is not.

The approach was in contrast to the attitude taken by a key member of the 2013 tour who was privately dreading spending the next seven weeks on the road.\n\nGilchrist spoke to several of Australia's Test squad and backroom staff, including coach Darren Lehmann and batting coach Graeme Hick, when the side was in Perth recently for the one-day international against Pakistan. He told them \"attitude is all important\" for the seven-week tour.\n\n\"I was very much a follower and believer of most things Steve Waugh was talking to us about. I took that very much on board and tried to do that as much as possible, still do now. I find it a fascinating country,\" Gilchrist, who has business interests in India, told Fairfax Media.\n\n\"It's a country that weighs you down, too. You have highs and lows, it's an emotional roller-coaster, on the field and off the field.\n\n\"You've got to find a way to escape from it \u2013 if it's in your hotel room, but you don't want to become a prisoner to your hotel room, you have to get out there.\n\n\"It's [attitude] going to be a huge percentage of what's required. The ingredients to success is a positive attitude, not just positive like you have to use your feet and go after the spinner but everything.\"\n\nGilchrist said Waugh, in a bid to keep morale high, told the players at the start of the tour \"attitudes are contagious, is yours worth catching?\"\n\n\"From that, he extended it, saying this will be a 'no whinge tour',\" Gilchrist said. \"Forever we've come to India and we're beaten before we get here. We're whinging about the food, the conditions, the umpiring and the hotel room, the flights. We weren't allow to whinge, pretty much. It was amazing.\n\n\"It's a great question you can ask yourself every day: how you think is how you feel and that's how you're going to act, is yours worth catching? And that really helped. We didn't get the chocolates on that tour but it was a strong foundation to what lay ahead.\"\n\nAustralia's players were also given a mid-tour break between Tests in 2004, which allowed them to spend time in Singapore and the Maldives with family and partners. The current squad has been given time off between the second and third Tests but they will not be leaving the country. Smith has already foreshadowed a more defensive strategy with the bat.\n\n\"That allowed us to get into the game without being blown away and the deeper you take it the more chance you are,\" Gilchrist said. \"The tactics will be important.\" Gilchrist is drawing hope from England's strong start to their recent series against India where they fell just short of victory in the first Test. But he said it would be \"frightfully difficult\".\n\n\"There's no reason why they can't get there and start well and build up confidence and be competitive about challenging for the series,\" Gilchrist said.\n\n\"As is the way in India momentum swings, whether it's an innings, a Test or a series, once it's against you it's a hard freight train to stop.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrew Wu"},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Global news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"India v Australia Test series: Adam Gilchrist tells Australia to embrace India","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"6004","state":"Western Australia","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"East Perth","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"WA Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169588399","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"27"},"name":"WA Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Cricket","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.watoday.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204044231","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:24:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He was 103. \n \nHartle died Tuesday afternoon at an Escondido, California, center for people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or dementia, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported Friday. A reporter was at his bedside with Hartle\u2019s son and daughter three hours before his death. \n \nHartle may have been the oldest surviving Pearl Harbor salvage diver, said David Ball of San Diego, an officer with the Navy Divers Association. \n \nHartle and his fellow Seabees worked in the days before scuba diving equipment was commonplace. His heavy canvas diving suit and brass helmet weighed more than 200 pounds (90 kg). \n \nJapan\u2019s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, sank or beached 18 ships. Among them was the battleship Arizona, which went down with 1,177 crew members. \n \nHartle was working as a civilian ship-fitter at a navy yard in the San Francisco Bay Area when the war broke out but he wasn\u2019t allowed to enlist until 1943 because his job was deemed too important to the war effort. \n \nHartle was proud of the work he performed over the next two years, his children said. He risked death by towing away unexploded torpedoes and salvaging ships and planes, first at Pearl Harbor and later from Maine to the Philippines. \n \nHe suffered the bends \u2014 painful and dangerous bubbles that emerge in the bloodstream from improper decompression \u2014 and was nearly killed when an anchor chain cracked and spewed metal shards. \n \nBut he avoided mentioning one task: recovering the long-submerged bodies of sailors who went to the bottom at Pearl Harbor. \n \n\u201cHe just didn\u2019t like talking about it,\u201d said his son, Ken W. Hartle, 64, of Montana. \u201cHe would only say that the hardest part of the job was \u2018bringing up our boys.\u2019 \u201c \n \nAmbert Kenneth Hartle was born in 1913 in Bakersfield, California. His mother, a brother and a sister died from illness or accidents before he was 10 and his father was sent to a tuberculosis sanitarium in 1916, according to Hartle\u2019s children. \n \nHartle and his siblings were sent to Los Angeles to live with relatives, but he hitchhiked to the San Francisco Bay Area. He worked as a prune-picker, a ranch hand and a cook for mining camps and resorts, earned a high school diploma and studied commercial art in college, where he also managed the basketball team. \n \nHis son said Hartle managed to cheat death several times, beginning at age 3 when a mule kicked him in the face and knocked him unconscious for 20 hours. \n \nAt 9, he was stabbed in the neck during a schoolyard brawl. In college, he was flung hundreds of feet when his car was crushed by a truck. He was bitten by a rattlesnake and a scorpion while working alone at a mining camp. \n \nHe had colon and prostate cancer, six heart bypass surgeries, and broke his shoulder falling from a ladder while trimming trees when he was 97. \n \n\u201cHe was from a generation of people who were amazingly tough,\u201d said his daughter and longtime caregiver, Karen Dahl, 66. \u201cHe had a lot of problems with pain from the work he did in his younger life, but he never complained.\u201d \n \nAfter the war, he settled in Buena Park, California, and later became a chicken breeder in Valley Center in northern San Diego County. \n \nHis second wife, Jeanne, died in 2008. \n \n\u201cHe was a great storyteller. He could talk for hours about his life in the most amazing detail,\u201d his daughter said. \u201cHe loved his life and he had a wonderful one.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"San Diego news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Military news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Navy salvage diver who recovered those who fell at Pearl Harbor dies at 103","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Eastern Asia","countryCode":"JP","country":"Japan"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Japan Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169733710","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Japan Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.japantimes.co.jp","publisher":"Japan Times"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204044486","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country.\n\nThe executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days. That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.\n\nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.\n\nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government.\n\nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.\n\n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\"\n\nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.\n\n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said.\n\n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\"\n\nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.

Monday has been declared a total fire ban day across the state, with emergency services expecting their worst conditions so far this season. Temperatures are forecast to hit 42 degrees in parts of Victoria, prompting a health warning in some districts. \n\nFirst state-wide Total Fire Ban https://t.co/hAY8WKmY5F\u2014 CFA Updates (@CFA_Updates) January 29, 2017\n\nThe Country Fire Authority has issued an extreme fire danger rating for the North-East district, and severe rating for most of the rest of the state.\n\nAt 6pm on Sunday, two grass fires were still burning at Willowmavin near Kilmore and Lang Lang, 73 kilometres south-east of Melbourne.\n\nCFA chief officer Steve Warrington said hot, dry and windy conditions could lead to major fires.\n\n\"Emergency services are preparing ahead of Monday's conditions and will be ready to respond to any fire that breaks out,\" Mr Warrington said.\n\n\"Grasslands around Melbourne and Geelong, as well as Gippsland and North East foothills, Goldfields and Ballarat area, and the Wimmera are areas of concern.\n\n\"Any fire that starts on Monday could be difficult to control.\"\n\nMr Warrington said weekend campers should extinguish campfires with water, not soil.\n\n\"Fires can still smoulder under soil. If it is cool to touch, it is safe to leave,\" he said.\n\n\"Be mindful of your activities, as it could be your actions that result in loss of life or property.\"\n\nMildura and Swan Hill are set to hit 42 degrees, Albury-Wodonga will see a peak of 41 degrees and Orbost in East Gippsland is expected to reach 40 degrees.\n\nThe Victorian Health Department has issued a heat health warning for the North Central, North East, and Northern Country districts.\n\nIt is going to be a hot Monday for Melbourne too, but forget a beach trip - or at least, don't expect much sun.\n\nAn increasing shield of high-level cloud will spoil the summer-fun potential of the forecast 34 degrees.\n\nBureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Richard Carlyon said the day will be windy and cloudy, with a smattering of rain.\n\n\"It is certainly not a hot, sunny summer's day,\" Mr Carlyon said.\n\n\"We do have a strong-wind warning over the waters, but over the beach ... it is going to be fresh and gusty winds,\" he said.\n\n\"Winds will be reasonably fresh ... around 15 to 25 knots around the coast, but with stronger gusts at times.\"\n\nThe temperature will peak around 1pm, but will drop to 30 degrees with the westerly change and stay around that mark for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nBut at least we'll be able to sleep in peace.\n\nA cool change in the evening will see the temperature drop to the mid-teens.\n\n\"There will be some change early afternoon as the hot northerly wind shifts westerly, but the true cooler change won't arrive until 7pm or 8pm,\" Mr Carlyon said.\n\n\"The temperature will drop to 16 degrees: it should be a fairly comfortable night.\"\n\nFor information on what is permitted on a total fire ban day, check the Can I and Can't I page on the CFA website.\n\nFor bushfire and grass fire warning visit www.emergency.vic.gov.au.

This has been in effect since 1 January 2016, although some of it only provisionally because ratification by the Netherlands is still outstanding. \n \n\"Firstly, the \"Ukraine Model\" corresponds to the British objectives in that it contains substantial market access but does not require the application of EU law or compliance with the case law of the ECJ, nor does it provide for free movement but it does allow free trade agreements with third countries. Thus the United Kingdom's four key requirements are met.\" \n \nHere is the CEP's table, illustrating the benefits of a Ukraine-style deal: \n \n\n \nThe think-tank does acknowledge that issues could arise with a Ukraine-style deal for the UK, particularly when it comes to the financial services sector \u2014 which has been one of the most contentious issues since the Brexit vote. \n \nBanks currently have the right to \"passport\" their financial licences in one EU market to another, preventing them having to go through the costly and complicated process of being regulated in each market where they operate, but that passport could be lost after the Brexit process has been completed, causing chaos for Britain's financial services industry. \n \nRoughly  13,500 companies use financial passporting  in relation to the UK with all types of businesses from newspapers to removals companies, all the way to a body that represents acupuncturists holding passports. \n \n\"The agreement with the Ukraine is unlikely to satisfy the United Kingdom as regards the scope of trade liberalisation because it contains numerous restrictions on market access particularly for cross-border services. The United Kingdom will probably require better access to the EU internal market, primarily in the interests of the British finance industry,\" the report notes. \n \nThat's where the \"Plus\" comes in, with the UK creating a bespoke deal that includes many of the features of the Ukrainian agreement, but also includes concessions to the banking and finance sectors.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Will Martin"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Eastern Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Ukraine news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"European Union news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"UK business news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Britain could strike a 'Ukraine Plus' style Brexit deal","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Business Insider UK","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552181789","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"226"},"name":"Business Insider UK","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://uk.businessinsider.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cep.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/cep.eu/Studien/cepAdhoc_Brexit/cepAdhoc_Ukraine_Plus_as_a_model_for_Brexit.pdf"],"sequenceId":"695204057319","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://static4.uk.businessinsider.com/image/588b4ac34f873f28008b46b9/britain-could-strike-a-ukraine-plus-style-brexit-deal.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Therefore, progressive governments must embrace creativity. We are committed, and we must reward contributors of creative ideas with incentives. \n\u201cThis is why we are keenly interested in further development of our creative talents; in providing them with support and opportunities to be engaged; in helping to create platforms such as today\u2019s to excel and compete globally and in showing to the world that Lagos is more than ready to announce its arrival as the continent\u2019s frontline destination of choice that gives arts and culture their due.\u201d \nAmbode said the Arts Exhibition, aside seeking to immortalise the sterling contributions of the late Co-Chair of the Lagos @ 50 Committee, Chief Rasheed Gbadamosi, presented a veritable platform for his administration to show its passion for the creative arts, especially by encouraging young and budding talents. \nHe said: \u201cThis is why we are keenly interested in further development of our creative talents; in providing them with support and opportunities to be engaged; in helping to create platforms such as today\u2019s to excel and compete globally and in showing to the world that Lagos is more than ready to announce its arrival as the continent\u2019s frontline destination of choice that gives arts and culture their due.\u201d \nAmbode said aside the six arts theaters and cinemas, which would come on board this year, his administration was making several other interventions to engage the arts community for the Lagos @ 50 celebrations, including engaging several artists to decorate various parts of our state with landmark installations. \n\u201cImagine if you give these young ones six arts theatres and cinemas across Lagos, that means they can display their talents, that means we would create more jobs for people, that means there would be money coming into Lagos and then we would have improved on tourism, that\u2019s what we are doing,\u201d Governor Ambode said. \nOn his part, Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, commended the efforts of Ambode, describing him as one of the most passionate governors keen to give the creative arts industry a face lift. \nMohammed said Ambode, aside being the first governor in Nigeria building theaters all over the State, his passion to upgrade the National Museum and the National Theatre to world class standard was second to none. \nHe added that through massive investment in the security apparatus in the State as well as the Light Up Lagos initiative, the Governor was putting in place lifelong infrastructures, which, according to him, was reviving a 24-hour economy for Lagos. \nCorroborating him, former Governor of Ogun State, Aremo Olusegun Osoba, was full of praise of Governor Ambode, saying that he has succeeded in bringing the old and the new together and restoring Lagos as the modern father of Nigeria. \nAlso speaking, arts collector extraordinaire, Omooba Yemisi Shyllon, said if Lagos can sustain the drive to revive the creative arts and entertainment industry, the State is capable of feeding Nigeria with foreign exchange. \nShyllon cited the Opera House in Paris in France, Spain and South Africa as countries which are raking in millions of dollars through arts, culture and tourism, adding that Lagos was already taking a cue. \nHe said: \u201cLagos State has blazed the trail. \n\u201cThank You Governor, you are the Moses we have been waiting for. \n\u201cIt takes a lot of insight for someone to identify this great creativity in this state and an industry is being created, joblessness would reduce, people will be busy, we would have less social problems, the image of this state will grow and we would become a great city.\u201d \n      \nAdvert \nHow I Increased my Manhood Size & Stopped Premature Ejaculation That Scattered My Relationship..

They will win it here. I tell you now.\" \n \nI was there to interview UKIP's new leader and candidate for the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election, Paul Nuttall. Nuttall's candidacy is a big test both of his own party's appeal following the departure of Nigel Farage, as well as Labour's. \n \nAs a result alarm bells were likely ringing loud in Labour Party HQ when it was first announced that the Merseysider would stand in the seat. \n \nLike in Copeland, where another by-election is set to take place on the same day, February 23, long-standing support for the Labour Party in city of Stoke is waning as many working-class voters feel increasingly disconnected from the party in its current form. \n \nFormer Labour MP Tristam Hunt fended off UKIP to hold this once-safe Labour seat in 2015 but with a slim majority of just over 5,000 people. This, plus the fact that over 70% of people here voted Leave in the June referendum, has Nuttall licking his lips as he aims to win what his predecessor Nigel Farage never could: a seat in Parliament. \n \n\"After the launch on Saturday we went out and we were literally mobbed on an estate by people coming out of their houses to shake our hands and say 'thank god you're here'.\" Nuttall tells me, taking a bite from his ham and mustard sandwich.  \n \n\"People were shouting 'good on you!' from their windows. \n \n\"People in Stoke have basically come to the conclusion that if they elect another Labour MP in this seat it'll just be like groundhog day. It'll be the same thing over and over again. This is the capital of Brexit and it can now become the capital of change if it votes UKIP on the 23rd of February.\" \n \nA prevailing feeling in Stoke, like in Copeland and so many other areas in Labour's traditional heartlands, is that London alone has benefitted from Westminster politics, while communities elsewhere in the country have been tossed aside and forgotten. \n \nImmigration is a huge concern for many people here. As is the sense that British people have been neglected in favour of helping those abroad. Stoke residents overwhelmingly backed Brexit in the EU referendum last year. UKIP see this all as a big opportunity to bite into Labour's support. \n \n\"I think it's breaking down. The whole generational thing \u2014 I vote Labour because my dad votes Labour \u2014 it is slowly but surely beginning to break down,\" Nuttall tells me. \n \n\"When you've got a seat in which over 70% voted to leave the EU and you've got a Labour Party that's completely all over the place as to where it stands on Brexit, I think we've got a great opportunity. Labour is going to select a candidate in this election with a history of campaigning to Remain in the EU. So, either they're completely out of kilter with the residents of this seat, or the Labour Party is taking its votes for granted... Change is in the air.\" \n Repairing a party on the brink of collapse  \nOne of the last times I shared a room with Nuttall was at the UKIP's September conference in Bournemouth. Diane James began her 19-day reign as leader that day. The mood was tense following a summer of internal turmoil in the party, but Bootle-born Nuttall took to the stage and urged party members to unite as it braced itself for the post-Farage era. \n \nHowever, what followed was a political soap-opera. James resigned after less than three weeks in charge, while party prodigy and her planned successor, Steven Woolfe, then quit the party after being hospitalised in a fight with fellow MEP Mike Hookem. UKIP was a mess. Nuttall, though, believes that he has steered the ship into much calmer waters. \n \nI ask him if he ever thought the party was close to collapsing altogether. \n \n\"Yep. It was going to collapse,\" he responds, without hesitation. \n \n\"That's why I had to stand. The day I knew I had to do something about it was when I was sitting at home like a normal punter, having had dental work done, with my hands over my face watching the news through my fingers thinking 'oh my god'. One of two things could have saved UKIP. Either Nigel came back or I stepped in. He wasn't coming back so I had to step in. That was the bottom line. I'd made the decision over the summer that my time in politics was coming to an end. I was going to go back to the backbench of the European Parliament while actively looking for another job outside of politics. Never once did I think I was going to be the leader. However, now I'm here, I'm enjoying it.\" \n \n\n \nHe tells me that UKIP is now much more united. \n \n\"The party is in a completely different place. In Bournemouth, you could have cut the air with a knife. I gave a speech there and it was close to the bone. I told the truth. UKIP resembled a jigsaw that had been tipped on the floor. I didn't think for one second that the leader to put it back together would be me. But I have. Myself and my deputy Peter Whittle have created a completely new atmosphere and a new attitude. \n \n\"Membership has gone up for the first time in quite a while, up to thirty-four and a half members now (34,500).\" \n \nNuttall, who held virtually every position in the party before becoming leader, has the chance to join Douglas Carswell as UKIP's only MPs in the Commons. Many commentators are tipping him to dethrone Labour here, with a recent Huffington Post report suggesting that the Tories could step aside to give him a clear run at the seat. He was keen to distance himself from Tory election strategy when I mentioned this report.\"Nope. It's not something that we've negotiated,\" he said. \"There's been no communication between myself and the Conservatives \u2014 put it that way.\" \n \nHowever, he dismissed my suggestion that failure to win here would be damaging to his own leadership. \n \n\"I'm only eight weeks in,\" he chuckled. \"People have got to give me time. People have asked me 'would you resign if you don't win this seat?' Well, of course I wouldn't. We will live to fight another day.\" \n His views on the NHS  \nOne of Nuttall's biggest weaknesses heading into this election is comments he has made in the past supporting the privatisation of the National Health Service. Labour shared footage of the former history lecturer claiming that the very existence of the public health service \"stifles competition\" immediately after his election. It will undoubtedly be a source of material that the Labour campaign will return to repeatedly up until February 23, especially with the difficulties faced by the local Royal Stoke University Hospital being such a big concern for locals. \n \n\"It's sad that the party of great political figures like Clement Attlee and Keir Hardie has come to this,\" he says. \n \n\"The only way Labour can win a by-election is by going negative. I'm going to be honest with you: I said that back in 2011. Labour people claim it was 2014 \u2014 it wasn't. I was talking about bringing more competition into the NHS because at the time I genuinely believed that in areas like procurement it made sense to bring in a private company. I also believed that in these areas the very structure of the NHS was preventing competition. \n \n\"But look: privatisation in the NHS hasn't worked,\" he added, bluntly. \n \n\"Labour privatised 5% of it while in power. The coalition government did the same with about 3.5%. Have things got better? They haven't. Labour has saddled the NHS with £80 billion worth of debt due to ridiculous PFI deals (private finance initiative). I'm not going to be lectured to on the NHS by a political party that resembles an abusive parent. Okay, they might have founded the NHS, but they haven't treated it very well. This is the party of the mid-staffs scandal. This the party of MRSA \u2014 you know? \n \n\"I'm sorry. I'm not going to be lectured to by Labour on this.\" \n \nHe goes on to argue that the crisis currently faced by the NHS would be alleviated by using the money saved from substantially slashing the amount of money donated to countries abroad. \n \n\"The NHS needs a short, sharp cash injection and we're the only party that'll say where it'll come from. It'll come from the foreign aid budget, which is now costing the British people £30 million a day. I bet you if you polled people up and down the country \u2014 particularly in this constituency \u2014 and asked them 'do you want a foreign aid budget that's going to cost £15 billion by the end of this parliament given to countries which in some cases are richer than ourselves? or do you want it to be spent on the NHS? I'm telling you: 100% would rather it spent on the NHS and that's UKIP's policy.\" \n Taking on the Tories  \nWith Theresa May looking set to lead Britain to a 'hard Brexit', one of the major challenges facing UKIP is remaining relevant while its primary mission is delivered not just by another party but by the government. UKIP has performed poorly in recent council by-elections and recent opinion polls haven't made encouraging reading either. But Nuttall was bullish and defiant in response to my suggestion that UKIP's expiry date could soon be approaching. \n \n\"I'm still not convinced by Theresa May on this. She campaigned to Remain. She's got a history of talking the talk without walking the walk. Just look at her record as Home Secretary, particularly when it comes to immigration. \n \n\"If people here want to go out and vote for somebody who campaigned all their adult lives for the sort of Brexit that they want to see \u2014 where we control our own borders and sign our own trade deals \u2014 then there's only one candidate for them to vote for. \n \n\"And let me perfectly clear: The Tories cannot win. The Conservatives cannot win this seat. They will not overturn the Labour majority. If you want an alternative to Labour in this seat, then only UKIP can deliver that.\" \n \nI ask him if he believes that May will go back on her promise to take Britain out of the single market. \n \n\"I hope not. It would be a betrayal of everything people voted for on June 23. To somehow now pretend that people didn't know what they were voting for \u2014 like some Labour and Lib Dem politicians are doing \u2014 is just completely disingenuous. You had the prime minister of the day, David Cameron, the Chancellor George Osborne, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond as well as Gove, Johnson, Farage and everyone else on the Leave side making it perfectly clear that leaving the European Union means leaving the single market. Everyone knew what they were voting for. To try and keep Britain inside the single market would be a betrayal of the will of the people and an absolute disgrace.\" \n The campaign in Stoke  \nBefore meeting with Nuttall, I spoke to a number of people in Stoke about what they want from their MP. One theme that cropped up time and time again was the need for a local candidate. Hunt failed to really connect with the community, I was told, as he was parachuted in to represent concerns that he didn't truly understand. \n \nYet, I put to Nuttall the proposition that he is being parachuted in, too. Yes, he isn't from London. Yes, he's from the North. But Liverpool is a long way from Stoke \u2014 and Liverpudlians would tell you that Stoke isn't even in the North. \n \n\"I don't think that matters,\" he tells me. \n \n\n \n\"The last two Labour MPs here were public school boys from down south. I have got far more in common with the people of Stoke than they did. I did live in Shelton for a short period of time in the late 1990's.\" \n \nWhat really matters, he insists, is what he and UKIP activists will be saying to people when they knock on their doors. \n \n\"We'll be talking about the NHS and Labour's awful record on the NHS. We'll be talking about law and order. We'll be talking about putting British people at the front of the queue when it comes to the housing market and ensuring that local people are put to the front of that queue, because we don't want to see communities broken up. We will be talking about issues that matter to local people on doorsteps. What we won't be doing is engaging in the Jeremy Corbyn kind of politics, which may well be the politics of Stoke Newington \u2014 but it isn't the politics of Stoke-on-Trent.\" \n \n\"I'll put Stoke on the map in ways that another Labour MP who will be a lobby-fodder, voice in the wilderness won't be able to do. I will champion the interests of Stoke above anything else,\" he adds. \n Farage and Trump  \nThe shadow of Farage looms over UKIP even now as he spends most of the time on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. He'll be back in the UK to campaign alongside his successor at a rally in Stoke on Monday, February 6. \n \nWith our interview coming to an end, I finish off by asking Nuttall about his relationship with Farage. \n \n\"We speak to each other every day when he's not in America. Yep, virtually every day,\" he says, taking the final sips of his coffee. \n \nBut he made it clear that he has no interest in the populist axis Farage has formed with US President Donald Trump. \n \n\"I'm not that interested. As the leader of UKIP, I will concentrate on elections in this country. Let those guys go off and do their thing. They're doing a really good job at the moment. I will concentrate on the party domestically.\" \n \n\"Would you have voted Trump?\" I ask. \n \n\"No, I wouldn't. I would have gone for the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. \n \n\"But I will say this. Now that Trump has been elected it'll be a great thing for Britain. He's an Anglophile and wants to do a free trade deal with this country. And o nce we start signing those trade deals all over the globe, Britain will go through a new era prosperity the like of which we haven't seen since the industrial revolution.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Adam Payne"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"NHS news","group":"Society"},{"name":"UK politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"European Union news","group":"Society"},{"name":"England news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Paul Nuttall interview: UKIP will take Stoke from 'lobby-fodder' Labour","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Business Insider UK","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552181789","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"226"},"name":"Business Insider UK","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://uk.businessinsider.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/tories-write-off-stoke-by-election-as-they-fear-awkward-defeat-party-sources-say_uk_588108f5e4b0b8867de7372b?u5qychtkilmu0udi"],"sequenceId":"695204060070","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://static3.uk.businessinsider.com/image/5888cabb6c9b1924008b6405/paul-nuttall-interview-ukip-will-take-stoke-from-lobby-fodder-labour.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The new snacks are made from fruit, veggies, and chia pressed together into a bar. To communicate the unique attributes of the products, KIND turned to brand design agency Chase Design Group to leverage cues from the juicing category and create the image of simplicity, healthfulness, and freshness. \n \nFor a brand known for products with ingredients that consumers can recognize and pronounce, transparency has been a core component of KIND\u2019s packaging. However, maintaining shelf stability and the need to differentiate the product from the core product line made the design team rethink their approach. According to Jon Lesser, Senior Director of Marketing, KIND, \u201cThe big challenge that Chase Design Group addressed was communicating the ingredient story through packaging while preserving our brand recognition.\u201d \n \nSays Clark Goolsby, VP, Creative Director, Chase Design Group, \u201cThe packaging features hand-drawn type, vibrant natural colors, and soft textures that are true to the lead ingredients in order to tell the story without showing the product.\u201d \n \nChase says the design strikes a balance between bold confidence and healthy snacking. The logo contains an interpretation of KIND\u2019s master logo and serves to create a sub brand that can stand on its own while visually relating to the parent brand. \n \nThe five different flavors of the Pressed by KIND bars include mango apple chia, pineapple coconut chia, banana kale spinach, apricot pear carrot beet, and cherry apple chia. They are sold individually and in four-count cartons in conventional, natural, and mass retail channels as well as at convenience stores and online retailers.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Graphics industry news","group":"Technology"}],"title":"Graphics for new snack bar leverage juicing category cues","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Packaging World","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661609","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Packaging World","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Materials","ContainersPackaging"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.packworld.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.chasedesigngroup.com/"],"sequenceId":"695204064881","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That\u2019s a prudent enough bow to the underlying realities \u2014 even if those realities are themselves absurd. \n \nYes, President Trump pledged repeatedly, as recently as the night before Inauguration Day, to move the embassy. \n \n\u201cYou know that I am not a person who breaks promises,\u201d he told the Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom \u2014 mindful that past presidents, both Republican and Democratic, had made the same commitment, only to renege. \n \nYet all signs now are that any transfer is on hold. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer indicates that no decision to move the embassy has been made. \n \nYes, this is disappointing: Israel plainly has the right to say which of its own cities is its capital \u2014 just as every other nation does. The only thing that makes this controversial is the decades-old Arab obsession with denying any Jewish historical connection to Jerusalem. \n \nBut the delay is also understandable. \n \nWith Trump looking to quickly enact his ambitious agenda \u2014 and with the national media eagerly highlighting every miscue \u2014 the last thing the new president needs right now is a foreign-policy crisis. \n \nYet it\u2019s clear that the Palestinian Authority and the Hamas rulers of Gaza are both prepared to unleash rolling riots and a regional crisis over any embassy move. \n \nWhich is why past presidents have regularly waived the 1995 law requiring Washington to move the embassy. \n \nNor does Israel want a crisis now, either. Plus, it understands the difficulties this would present to countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE \u2014 which are all now engaging with Israel on security issues to counter the growing Iranian threat. \n \nThen again, moving the embassy would not \u2014 as President Barack Obama long insisted \u2014 compromise Washington\u2019s presumed neutrality on Jerusalem\u2019s status. \n \nAfter all, the United States already has a diplomatic facility in Jerusalem \u2014 one that acts as the de facto US representative to the Palestinian Authority. \n \nAnd that facility is in East Jerusalem, whose status will be decided in negotiations \u2014 not West Jerusalem, where the embassy would be. \n \nAnd which has always been part of Israel \u2014 and always will be. \n \nMoreover, moving the embassy would demonstrate a renewed US commitment to its traditional allies and a demonstration that Washington keeps its word \u2014 both sorely lacking under Obama. \n \nWe hope Trump will decide to move the embassy, as promised, when the time is right. But it\u2019s more important that he\u2019s made it clear that, unlike the past eight years, Israel will have no cause to doubt that it has a real friend in the White House. \n  Share this","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Post Editorial Board"},"topics":[{"name":"Palestinian territories news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Jewish news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Why the US Embassy isn\u2019t moving to Jerusalem yet","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"New York","zipCode":"10036","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"New York","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"New York Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658380","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"124827"},"name":"New York Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nypost.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204072609","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:25:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/israel_usa_embassy_relocation.jpg?quality=90&strip=all"},{"url":"https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/israel_usa_embassy_relocation.jpg?quality=90&strip=all"}],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

Privacy Policy \n\nDo you have Dow 20,000 envy? \n\nTake heart, you might be richer than you think. \n\nYou may have wished during all the hype over the Dow Jones industrial average hitting 20,000 that you had been buying stocks. \n\nBut you may actually own stocks without knowing it. If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent -- a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old -- give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\n...continued \n\nMore Business News \n\nBusiness News / January 27, 2017 \n\nNEW YORK -- It could take more than a political standoff between President Donald Trump and Mexico to keep U.S. shale gas from flowing south. \n\nWhile Mexico works to reverse declining oil and gas production, the nation's ...Read More \n\nBusiness News / January 27, 2017 \n\nWASHINGTON -- During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump said he declare China a currency manipulator on \"day one.\" He hasn't done so yet, but the new administration looks ready to, risking a trade war between the ...Read More \n\nBusiness News / January 27, 2017 \n\nWASHINGTON -- The Trump administration's decision to pull television ads urging Americans to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act is stoking fears that the White House is trying to sabotage the nation's ...Read More \n\nBusiness News / January 27, 2017 \n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis has ordered reviews of the Air Force One and F-35 fighter jet programs, two projects that have frequently been in President Trump's crosshairs. \n\nPentagon spokesman Capt.

We'll see a very different side to what we're normally used to \u2013 we're going to see more spin bowling over there. \n \n\"That's a good thing because you've got to play the conditions in India. The stats say that our quicks are better over there but mostly it's the quicks that bowl over there, we don't really bowl a lot of spin. \n \n\"It was Shane Warne before that and over the last 10 or so years there's been a lot of changes with our spin bowling.\" \n \nAustralia lost their last Test tour of India 4-0, and not a single member of the Australian team has won a Test in the country. \n \nNot since 2004 when Warne was rubbing shoulders with Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden and Glenn McGrath has Australia won a series in India. \n \nJohnson played seven Tests there without success before retiring from the longer form of the game at the start of last summer. \n \nAfter some significant arm-twisting by Scorchers coach Justin Langer, the fearsome left-arm quick was enticed to have a season in the BBL and his signing proved a masterstroke. \n \nHe saved his best two performances for last, claiming a record 3-3 in the semi-final win over the Melbourne Stars before finishing with 1-13 in his side's towering nine-wicket win over the hapless Sixers. \n \n\"It's just a really good tournament, I was probably one that never embraced Twenty20 cricket when I was playing international cricket but now that's all I'm playing, that's very enjoyable,\" Johnson said. \n \n\"The crowds are amazing too. That was one thing that I probably noticed throughout this Big Bash is the crowd and support and talking to the guys \u2013 random punters coming up and saying 'I hope you have a good season' to guys that don't have the profile. \n \n\"To get that experience and that exposure through the Big Bash, it's great for them.\" \n \nAnd icing the cake on the Scorchers' third Big Bash title, Johnson said he planned on returning to the competition next year. \n \n\"I only want to do it if I'm going to perform and I guess this year was a bit of a see how it sort of goes,\" Johnson said. \n \n\"JL [Langer] was really good with me throughout, he just said: 'Come and have fun mate, there's no pressure, you're not the No.1 strike-bowler we just want you to go and have fun and enjoy it and whatever happens happens'. \n \n\"It turns out that competitiveness in me is still there so if the body holds up and I'm bowling well then yeah.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Baltimore City","zipCode":"21211","state":"Maryland","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Baltimore","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WBAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659774","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"477"},"name":"WBAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wbaltv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204084179","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:21:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://hips.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/traveler-released-at-jfk-airport-1485651543.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

Morty Ortega/ \n\nRelated content \n\n(CNN) - More protests against President Donald Trump's immigration policies are set for Sunday across the country after hundreds of demonstrators converged on airports the day before.. \n\nProtests are scheduled today in Washington, Orlando, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle, and Chicago, mostly at airports. \n\nThis is the second weekend of demonstrations, with more than 1 million people coming out last weekend for the Women's March. \n\nOlivia Katbi Smith told CNN affiliate KATU she showed up Saturday at Portland International Airport because she believes Trump's immigration policies are cruel. \n\n\"I think it's horrific and terrible and we are basically condemning people to death by not allowing them to come here,\" she said. \n\nShe said the event appeared to be impromptu. She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n\nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n\n\"Mr. President, look at us,\" said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \"This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American.\" \n\nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \"We are all immigrants!\" and \"No ban! No wall!\" \n\nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n\nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n\n\"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said. \n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \"What's happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\" \n\nAirport arrests \n\nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n\nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \"President Trump's new Muslim ban.\" \n\nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n\nThat move limited part of President Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n\n\"This executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\" he said in a statement. \n\nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \"Portland coffee comes from Yemen,\" one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n\nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \"hashtag activist\" but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n\n\"This was the last straw,\" she said of Trump's policies. \"We're all immigrants.\" \n\nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n\nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests against Trump's 'Muslim ban' continue","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Placer","zipCode":"96145","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Tahoe City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KVIA.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169714195","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"8"},"name":"KVIA.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kvia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204088134","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Data has become a transformative driver in delivering real-time e-services for knowledge-based consumers, says NetApp . The company shared its outlook for 2017 recently, discussing how data has and will continue to change the way business is conducted. \nKey is a change in user expectations, of iPhone-like simplicity and self-management, and the integration of applications and services, says Rick Scurfield, President, NetApp APAC. \"These expectations are affecting development across all technologies in storage and data management. User experiences with mobile app simplicity in a wide variety of forms has raised expectations for the usability and simplicity of data management software. And from a business standpoint, companies are demanding this simplicity because it will enable them to use less expensive resources to manage their data while giving them greater access and use of their data as a critical business asset.\" \n\nScurfield made a distinction between the use of data to run the business to data literally being the business. \"With data so valuable to success, it has become the new currency of the digital age and has the potential to reshape every facet of the enterprise from business models to technology and user expectations. We\u2019ve seen this in the emergence of companies like Uber and Airbnb, which are built around the control of a network of resources,\" he said. \n\n \"To make things even more interesting, we continue to see new types of data that enterprises didn\u2019t used to think about collecting. For example, whereas we used to store and share only critical transactional data, we now store mass amounts of ancillary data surrounding transactions for deep analysis. This can include clickstream data and even data about weather and other external factors that provide market insight.\"  The emerging focus on data will require an ecosystem of related providers, developers, infrastructure and services, Scurfield added. Cloud-based services that provide easy access to the infrastructure needed to support innovation are one component of the ecosystem, enabling lowered barriers to entry and projects that can be set up in a day. Ultimately, NetApp sees the cloud evolve into a marketplace where usage and services are brokered and rates negotiated.  \nNew application paradigms will also spawn as a result, similar to the way Ethernet became a networking standard and Linux, a standard operating system, Scurfield said. \"We\u2019ve seen this emerge in the form of today\u2019s DevOps movement, where compositional programming based on micro services and mashups, open source and containerisation have taken hold. Currently, these are considered niche solutions, but as the value of data becomes more critical to business and the pace of innovation becomes an even more crucial competitive weapon, they will quickly move into the mainstream. As that happens, these technologies will further reduce friction in the integration of businesses and the movement of talent,\" he predicted. \nAnother change involves storage, which will see \"a wider dynamic range\" of related technologies. Scurfield named hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) as an IT architecture to watch as it simplifies infrastructure while making it more manageable. \n\n\"While the first wave of HCI solutions have done well, they have not addressed additional requirements for flexibility and scalability. Building web scale infrastructure will call for the flexibility to adapt the ratio of compute to storage according to the need, enable the upgrade of compute and storage separately, and scale easily and cost effectively,\" he noted. \n\n\"Expect the next wave of HCI solutions to leverage what we\u2019ve learned from converged infrastructure to deliver web scale converged infrastructure that meets these requirements. We also see the build out of higher bandwidth networks to manage the movement of large volumes of data. On the horizon, storage technologies such as archive class storage and massive persistent memory are next in line for adoption. The rapid development of easy and accessible data management services will allow for easier deployment of these emerging technologies.\" \n\nIn NetApp's vision of the future, automation, data-tiering and policy-driven processes will extend data storage into a secure hybrid cloud architecture supported by global data management capabilities. \"New storage opex models will evolve as software-defined everything continues to meet the flexibility demanded by enterprises, which will further accelerate their digital transformation journey,\" Scurfield said. \n\"Businesses in the transportation, fitness, entertainment and leisure industries will deliver a fresh new level of predictive solutions which are intelligent and integrates consumer preferences with real-time, competitive service offerings.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Joy Tang"},"topics":[{"name":"Health care industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Data has changed everything, and everything will change data","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"SG","country":"Singapore"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"TechTrade Asia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"610638420","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"TechTrade Asia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","HealthCare","Medical"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.techtradeasia.info"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-d4mlHNa1HJQ/WI2VHuhcHPI/AAAAAAAAaeM/ALyfkiJHcb8aywXFR8O8h1VGVjHDn-9xACLcB/s1600/netapp%2Bscurfield.JPG","http://www.netapp.com/"],"sequenceId":"695204093299","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T15:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-d4mlHNa1HJQ/WI2VHuhcHPI/AAAAAAAAaeM/ALyfkiJHcb8aywXFR8O8h1VGVjHDn-9xACLcB/s72-c/netapp%2Bscurfield.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

He said today he did not want to 'shut the Left in unreality and illusion'. \n\nRegardless of whoever wins the nomination, polls suggest he will struggle to overcome the negative legacy of François Hollande's presidency and will not progress beyond the first round of the Presidential elections in April. \n\nMr Fillon and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen are expected to face off in the second round of the race for the Elysée, with centrist Emmanuel Macron finishing third. \n\nBut Mr Fillon has become embroiled in a scandal over claims that his wife was paid for parliamentary work she did not do. He has denied the allegations, and said he would drop out of the race if a formal investigation was launched. \n\nAccording to a poll released on Friday, only 38% of respondents had a positive opinion of him, against 54% in November and 42% earlier this month. \n\nIt has been reported that, if he drops out, there could be no centre-right candidate at the elections. \n \nPhoto: Rama / CC BY-SA 2.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Valls and Hamon  face off in polls","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Western Europe","countryCode":"MC","country":"Monaco"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"The Connexion","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"610611872","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"44"},"name":"The Connexion","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.connexionfrance.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1984744","http://on.fb.me/mTIp3s","http://bit.ly/pVQ9Zl"],"sequenceId":"695204098858","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Building upon what has already been announced, he was able to reveal details of a dozen new productions, half written by women, spread across the three auditoria. \n Olivier  \nNorris started with the Olivier Theatre welcoming what he believes may be a previously unprecedented three major openings in a single season. This is partly made possible by 92% audience figures across the piece over the previous year, which allows the theatre feels able to invest in some of the exciting new voices coming through today. \n \nHe positively enthused about St George and the Dragon by Rory Mullarkey. This piece, which will be directed by Lyndsey Turner, is a new incarnation of the epic folk play looking into what it means to be English today. \n \nIn addition to St George , Anne-Marie Duff (who is also taking the lead in D C Moore\u2019s Common ) and Rory Kinnear will be starring in a new production of Macbeth marking two auspicious anniversaries. It is both 25 years since the Olivier last saw a production of this play and 25 years since Norris himself last directed a work by Shakespeare. \n \nFinally, in January 2018 Amadeus is to be revived with Lucien Msamati and Adam Gillen once again taking the leading roles. \n Lyttelton  \nIn the Lyttelton Theatre, the first highlight comes in November 2017 with a stage adaptation by Lee Hall of the Oscar-winning movie Network , which Norris describes as incredibly prescient. This is to be directed by Ivo van Hove capitalising on his recent success with Hedda Gabler and will star Hollywood heartthrob Bryan Cranston. \n \nA month later, the influences behind Disney musicals, Matilda the Musical and Harry Potter and the Curse of the Golden Child all join forces when John Tiffany directs an adaptation of Pinocchio by Dennis Kelly, which will contain songs and music from the Disney movie. \n Dorfman  \nIn the Dorfman, Rob Drummond returns with The Majority , a solo show about democracy, which started out addressing Scottish independence for the Arches in Glasgow but is likely to be very different by the time it gets to London. \n \nThat opens in August, while in October Polly Findlay will be directing Beginning by David Eldridge, a rare romantic comedy for the National. \n \nFinally, Annie Baker, whose strikingly different The Flick challenged audiences in 2016, is returning with John directed by James Macdonald and starring George Engel, who starred in the original production in New York for and for whom the play was written. \n Touring and NT Live  \nNorris was also excited about the National\u2019s series of touring productions which will be supplemented by Jane Eyre , My Country; a Work in Progress by Carol Ann Duffy with Norris and People, Places and Things . \n \nAs he explained, while the National has worked on a large number of co-productions with regional theatres during the first 18 months of his tenure, this would be a different way of getting to places that are less well served by live arts. \n \nHe was also particularly proud about the transfer of People, Places and Things to St Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn, which he confirmed would star Denise Gough, once she had finished taking on the National\u2019s revival of Tony Kushner\u2019s epic Angels in America . \n \nTen shows have also been confirmed in the upcoming NT Live season seven of which are home productions and three from other theatres. \n \nFull details are now available on the National Theatre web site .﻿","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: theater news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"The National Theatre in 2017","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"British Theatre Guide","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"467679272","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"British Theatre Guide","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts","Theater"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.britishtheatreguide.info"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/"],"sequenceId":"695204111053","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Dar es Salaam City Council (DCC) is now staring at the prospect of losing control of the Sh5.8 billion paid by Simon Group in the controversial purchase of a 51 per cent stake in Usafiri Dar es Salaam (Uda).\n\nA meeting by the opposition Chadema-led Council on Friday ended with no agreement on how the money should be used.\n\nThis leaves the City Fathers with only 48 hours to come up with an expenditure plan, or risk losing control of the billions of shillings to the Ministry of Regional Administration and Local Government.\n\nAt the launch of the Dar Rapid Transit (Dart) last Wednesday, President John Magufuli gave the Dar es Salaam City Council five days to determine how they were going to use the money. He said the government would hand it over to the ministry if there was no decision within the deadline.\n\nBut yesterday, the Dar es Salaam City Mayor, Mr Charles Mwita, told The Citizen that they failed to reach an agreement during the Friday meeting because some \u201cimportant people\u201d were absent.\n\n\u201cIt is not wise to make a decision on such an important issue without involving all the people,\u201d he said, \u201cAs you are aware, a lot of the DCC members, such as MPs, are not around\u2026 therefore, we cannot make decision with councillors only.\u201d\n\nThe meeting turned chaotic with some hardliners within Chadema digging in and not wanting to have anything to do with the money the opposition says was \u201cill-gotten\u201d in the shady deal between the City Council and Simon Group.\n\nSome counsellors insist that the sale of Uda shares was unprocedural. However, it turns out that some Chadema members in the DCC are willing to compromise.\n\nThough he admitted that the meeting was a difficult one, the Mayor said the failure to reach an agreement did not arise from any misunderstanding among Chadema members.\n\nHe said since yesterday, his office was communicating with municipal executive directors, mayors and MPs to arrange a new date to finalise the matter.\n\nMr Mwita noted that the Council needed more time to conclude the matter with the participation of all eligible members. Some MPs are currently engaged in parliamentary committee meetings in Dodoma.\n\n\u201cOn this ground, I will ask the Head of State to extend the deadline,\u201d he explained.\n\nReached for comment yesterday, Regional Administration and Local Government minister George Simbachawene said he was still waiting for a report from DCC on what had been agreed on.\n\n\u201cI know that they met on Fri\u2026","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Tanzania news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Dar City set to lose control of Uda cash","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"MyInforms","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552614979","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"MyInforms","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://myinforms.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/News/Dar-City-set-to-lose-control-of-Uda-cash/1840340-3791340-ejq6qn/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695204124723","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://i1.myinforms.com/300x200/default.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

A new UAE Fire and Life Safety Code (the New Code) had already been on the cards and was finally launched by Dubai Civil Defence officials at the Intersec Fire Safety Conference on 22 January 2017. \n Construction in the UAE  \nA construction boom followed the UAE's discovery of oil in the late 1970s, and until the issuance of the 2012 UAE Fire and Life Safety Code (the 2012 Code) the industry was subject to light-touch regulation. \n \nAs a result, and owing to the appealing cost of aluminium composite panels (ACP), high rise buildings in the UAE were typically built with facades of ACP cladding sandwiching a highly-combustible core. Studies have found that more than 65 percent of the high rise buildings in the UAE were built with external panels containing combustible materials. \n \nWhilst the 2012 Code was introduced in a bid to improve safety in the region, it evidently did not go far enough in its safety requirements. Delays in updating the 2012 Code were likely caused by the desire to incorporate lessons learned from recent fires including the Address Downtown Hotel, the Torch Tower, the Oceana Residences and the Sulafa Tower, where ACP cladding was a key contributor to the rapid propagation of those fires. \n The New Code  \nThe New Code addresses the shortfalls of the 2012 Code, and significantly increases accountability across and beyond the local construction industry, bringing rules in line with global standards. \n \nThe New Code seeks to instil higher standards of fire safety at all stages of construction. Importantly, companies involved in the installation of materials will now need to be registered and licenced by the Civil Defence. \n \nPreviously, such registration was incumbent only on consultants and contractors. Further, it contains more detailed specifications for cladding and construction materials and mandates more comprehensive materials tests, which will be facilitated by the establishment of a new materials-testing laboratory. \n \nFollowing construction, both the main works consultant and manufacturer of any fire safety materials will be required to jointly sign-off on completion of every project before obtaining final approvals from the Civil Defence, and consultants will remain responsible for defects for at least one year following delivery of a project. \n \nThis is evidently more burdensome on manufacturers, and, along with fines on building consultants in relation to faulty or unapproved fire safety material, should act as a deterrent from opting for dangerous (albeit budget friendly) materials. Penalties also include criminal prosecution and fines between AED 500 to AED 50,000 per violation. \n \nNotably, the New Code does not apply retrospectively. To account for this, the New Code contains a requirement to annually renew no-objection certificates (NOC) from the Civil Defence to ensure structures remain fire safe (as opposed to a one-time only completion certificate under the old regime). This also seeks to ensure repair work is in line with new standards. \n \nMajor General Rashid Thani Al Matroushi, Director General of Dubai Civil Defence had previously highlighted human error as a key contributor to high incidences of fires in the UAE. \n \nAlong with expanding liability amongst construction professionals, the New Code's focus on accountability extends to residents (both owners and tenants) to take practical measures, such as care when barbecuing on balconies, to reduce risk of fires. \n \nThe Civil Defence have confirmed that when the New Code is formally released, there will be a[three to six month grace period (depending on the project) for various stakeholders to comply with the New Code.  \n \nGiven the significant role the Civil Defence and municipalities play under the New Code, it remains to be seen how these bodies will cope with the strain of enforcement, and what practical issues the construction industry will face. \n Impact on the Property Market  \nIt is too early to gauge the impact of the New Code on local insurers and international reinsurers. However, with the expansion of accountability and liability to capture stakeholders, and the increased costs of compliance, attention will be insurers to gauge their response. \n \nHigher premiums may be inevitable, particularly for those buildings with combustible ACP. In addition, there is already evidence of increased pressure on local insurers to increase retention levels for high-rise buildings, to ensure that their interests are aligned with reinsurers. \n \nDespite recent events however, there is a surprisingly low penetration rate of property insurance amongst UAE residents. If the New Code brings renewed confidence in the property market, it is unlikely homeowners, unless directed by the authorities, will opt for such insurance. \n \nMuch like the pressure on Qatar to improve its legislation and best practices ahead of the 2022 World Cup, stakeholders around the world will be scrutinising the New Code and its practical effects, particularly ahead of Expo 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"United Arab Emirates news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"The UAE\u2019s hotly anticipated new fire code \u2013 a change is nigh","source":{"category":"Corporate","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Clyde & Co","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"171338637","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"60"},"name":"Clyde & Co","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Organisations"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.clydeco.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204125011","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:14:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He has found a unique way of disposing of dead chainsaws. He decorates his property with them.\n\nThe Lawrence County native retired a few years ago after 30 years as a Teamster truck driver in the Indianapolis area. Although working in Indianapolis, he maintained his home in Lawrence County. He has lived in the same place since 1971.\n\nBaker started decorating his property with old chainsaws a few years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a fascination with them,\u201d he said. \u201cI cut my own wood and tinkered with the saws when they weren\u2019t working. I needed something to go in the corner of the yard. I liked the idea of collecting chainsaws.\u201d\n\nWhat he did in the corner of his yard is build a totem pole of chainsaws. The pole is surrounded by several chainsaws stuck, blade first, into the ground, forming a fence around the pole.\n\n\u201cI pick them up at flea markets and yard sales,\u201d he said.\n\nBaker said a lot of people stop by and take pictures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really pretty in the summer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of flowers around the place. I take care of the roses and my wife, LaTonia, takes care of the rest.\u201d\n\nIn his shop in the garage, there are 14 chainsaws of various sizes. He said there are probably another 65 or so scattered around the property. There is even a model airplane built out of chainsaw bars. The wings and the fuselage are longer bars from bigger chain saws. The horizontal and vertical stabilizers at the back of the airplane are made from smaller bars, cut down to fit.\n\nBaker built his own piston can crusher. A can is placed in the end of a tube. When the switch is hit, an electric motor powers the piston and crushes the can, which falls into a large bin.\n\nHe also built a two-story grist mill that operates 24/7 during the summer. A circulating pump supplies the water flow that powers the grist mill. The water is then collected and the process happens all over again.\n\nIn his garage is a collection of Garcia-Mitchell fishing reels.\n\n\u201cThey are made in France,\u201d he said. \u201cI have about 130 of them. I have about 180 fishing rods and reels in my collection.\u201d\n\nHe said retirement has been enjoyable, but he learned on Oct. 12 that he has cancer and may only 3 to 6 months to live.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JEFF ROUTH"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Indianapolis news","group":"US regional"}],"title":"Making lawn art out of broken chainsaws","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Marion","zipCode":"46204","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indianapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Journal-Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657677","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1517"},"name":"Journal-Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.journalgazette.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204128725","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T21:07:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Morty Ortega/ \n\nRelated content \n\n(CNN) - More protests against President Donald Trump's immigration policies are set for Sunday across the country after hundreds of demonstrators converged on airports the day before.. \n\nProtests are scheduled today in Washington, Orlando, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle, and Chicago, mostly at airports. \n\nThis is the second weekend of demonstrations, with more than 1 million people coming out last weekend for the Women's March. \n\nOlivia Katbi Smith told CNN affiliate KATU she showed up Saturday at Portland International Airport because she believes Trump's immigration policies are cruel. \n\n\"I think it's horrific and terrible and we are basically condemning people to death by not allowing them to come here,\" she said. \n\nShe said the event appeared to be impromptu. She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n\nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n\n\"Mr. President, look at us,\" said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \"This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American.\" \n\nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \"We are all immigrants!\" and \"No ban! No wall!\" \n\nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n\nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n\n\"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said. \n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \"What's happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\" \n\nAirport arrests \n\nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n\nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \"President Trump's new Muslim ban.\" \n\nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n\nThat move limited part of President Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n\n\"This executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\" he said in a statement. \n\nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \"Portland coffee comes from Yemen,\" one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n\nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \"hashtag activist\" but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n\n\"This was the last straw,\" she said of Trump's policies. \"We're all immigrants.\" \n\nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n\nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests against Trump's 'Muslim ban' continue","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lehigh","zipCode":"18103","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Allentown","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WFMZ-TV Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667303","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"650"},"name":"WFMZ-TV Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wfmz.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204128895","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long. \n \nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports. \n \nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader. \n \nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion. \n \nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups. \n \nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism. \n \n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

Tough times in the 1970s saw the campus shuttered, with books tossed in dumpsters and students saying goodbye to the hopes of earning their degrees near the base of a ski mountain in rural Colorado. \n  \n\n  \nThe story of Steamboat\u2019s campus is one of perseverance and includes a community willing to fight and fund a college in Steamboat Springs. \n \nThis year, Colorado Mountain College celebrates 50 years as a college system in Colorado, and the Steamboat Springs campus recognizes its own 50th year as a campus and 36th year as a part of CMC. \n \nThe pioneering years \n \nGeorge Tolles remembers meeting Lucile Bogue while the two were teachers at The Lowell Whiteman School in Strawberry Park in the 1950s. \n \n\u201cWe became friends,\u201d said Tolles, who still lives in Steamboat today. \n \nYears later, while traveling as a foreign service officer in the U.S. State Department, Tolles heard from Bogue, who was in the early stages of beginning a college in Steamboat. \n \n\u201cI received a telegraph from Lucy Bogue, and she said, \u2018Guess what, George? I\u2019ve started a college in Steamboat Springs. Why don\u2019t you come teach?\u2019\u201d Tolles recalled. \u201cAnd so, that\u2019s what I did.\u201d \n \nAs Bogue recounts in her 1987 book \u201cMiracle on a Mountain,\u201d 11 students gathered at the Methodist Church for the first day of classes in September 1962. \n \n\u201cThe community felt very warm and close that afternoon,\u201d Bogue said, \u201clike a big family that had pulled off some kind of miracle, all of us fast friends.\u201d \n \nThe school aimed to be a four-year college, with an emphasis on international relations. The first students came from across the country, and as far away as Kenya and Argentina. \n \nThere was no campus and no dorms, so students stayed with Bogue in exchange for shoveling snow or with other host families in town, Tolles recalled. \n \nClasses were held in churches, at motels and elsewhere on Lincoln Avenue. \n  George Tolles talks about YVC's early years   \nBy the second year, the campus had grown to 26 full-time students, and 60 more community members were registered for classes. \n \nBogue served initially as college president, but as the school grew and other responsibilities took more of her time, the college\u2019s board brought in new administrators to run the expanding college. \n\n \nAlumnus Charlie Eckstrom remembers arriving in Steamboat Springs in 1964 as a transfer student from Menlo College in California. \n \n\u201cThere was a core group of six or eight professors that just made it wonderful for young people to come and learn and find themselves,\u201d Eckstrom said. \u201cI liked the small town, and I made a conscious decision to stay and not return to Menlo.\u201d \n \nThe college moved into its permanent home on Woodchuck Hill in 1966, constructing three buildings \u2014 Monson, Willett and Bogue, named in Lucile Bogue\u2019s honor \u2014 that served as a combination of dorm rooms, faculty offices and classrooms. \n \n\u201cIt was kind of exciting,\u201d Tolles said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe that it was actually a campus.\u201d \n \n CMC then and now Colorado Mountain College in the early 1980s vs today. \n \nA campus in limbo \n \nDespite steady enrollment, in 1969, Colorado Alpine College folded, and the school was purchased by United States International University, a San Diego-based college operator. \n \nUSIU in 1975 chose to shutter the school, leaving the Steamboat Springs campus in limbo. \n \nTolles, who taught classes in world history, politics and German, remembers that teachers taught through the end of the year, before students began to leave and dumpsters were filled with books. \n \n\u201cIt collapsed,\u201d Tolles said. \n \nDuring the next five years, the campus served various purposes, including as housing for visiting skiers and as an outreach center for Colorado Northwestern Community College. \n \nIn 1978, after hearing that USIU planned to sell the college and land to a commercial developer to be used for apartments, community members banded together to regain local control of the campus. \n  \n1951\u2014Lucy Bogue first considers idea of starting a college in Steamboat Springs \n \n1962\u2014Yampa Valley College opens, with classes held around town \n \n1966\u2014Willett, Bogue and Monson halls are built on Woodchuck Hill; name is changed to Colorado Alpine College \n \n1969\u2014Colorado Alpine College folds; and the campus is purchased by United States International University \n \n1975\u2014USIU shutters Steamboat campus, and college is rented out for various purposes through 1979 \n \n1978\u2014Yampa Valley Foundation forms to save college \n \n1980\u2014A proposed local taxing district to fund a college is turned down by state; foundation aligns with Colorado Mountain College \n \n1981\u2014Voters of Steamboat Springs School District boundaries vote to tax themselves as part of CMC district \n \n1990s\u2014Bristol Hall, Anderson building and Hill Hall constructed \n \n2011\u2014College earns approval to offer bachelor\u2019s degrees \n \n2012\u2014New academic center opens \n \n2017\u2014CMC celebrates 50 years, while Steamboat\u2019s campus recognizes its 50th year with campus and 36th year with CMC \n  \nSteamboat Chamber President Bill Hill worked with early college founders and coal mining company Energy Fuels to form the nonprofit Yampa Valley Foundation \u2014 a group that worked to regain control by purchasing back the debt-ridden campus from USIU. \n \n\u201cIt was clear that Steamboat Springs did not want to lose the Alpine Campus,\u201d Hill wrote in a memoir called \u201cBorn Again: The College Too Tough to Die.\u201d \u201cSomething had to be done.\u201d \n \nMembers of the foundation\u2019s original board of directors included Energy Fuels President Jack Eatherton, Alpine Federal Savings President Rex Pielstick, Hill, attorney Tim Borden and John Fetcher, an original founder of Yampa Valley College, among others. \n \nEnergy Fuels owner Bob Adams, a philanthropic Steamboater whose generosity is recognized throughout the city today, heard of the foundation\u2019s goal to buy back the college and donated the $60,000 needed to do so. \n \nBut the community no longer supported having a college that doubled as a private business venture, Hill recalled in his memoir. \n \nAnd Hill, who volunteered to give up his post at the Chamber and become college administrator, inherited a campus in disrepair, with overdue bills, rundown dormitories. The only classes being taught were part of the CNCC outreach center. \n \nChanneling the pioneering \u201cAlpine Spirit\u201d of Bogue, Hill said he and the foundation worked tirelessly to restart a community-minded Steamboat Springs-based college at the site. \n \nThe group first attempted to create a local taxing district to fund the college, but the idea was turned down by the state. \n \nThen, in 1981, voters in the Steamboat Springs School District were asked whether they\u2019d tax themselves to fund the future of the campus as part of Colorado Mountain College, a regional community college system with a presence already in Leadville, Glenwood Springs, Salida, Eagle and Rifle. \n \nStability within CMC \n \nSteamboat Springs voters in May 1981 expressed their interest and financial support for Steamboat\u2019s college, and a proposition to join the CMC taxing district passed with 2-to-1 support. \n\n \nColorado Mountain College classes began in fall 1981, and in addition to some returning faculty, including Tolles, new staff was brought in from CMC to help usher the campus into a new era. \n \nLeadville faculty member George Bagwell was tapped to serve as campus dean \u2014 the highest-ranking, on-site administrator. \n \n\u201cThe president (of the college) said it was my job to bring that Steamboat campus into the fold,\u201d said Bagwell, who still lives in Steamboat today. \n \nHe remembers extensive work that had to take place to update the school\u2019s curriculum, eliminating the horseshoeing certificate program and others in favor of new programs in ski business, computers and a larger focus on liberal arts. \n \nThough CMC provided a stable funding base, a national recession postponed any new building on the campus, which was still anchored by three quirky buildings designed as \u201cliving-learning\u201d centers, with classrooms in the center and dorms and offices around the exterior. \n  Celebrating CMC's 50th  \nSteamboat Springs will celebrate Colorado Mountain College\u2019s 50-year anniversary with a reception and program beginning at 4:30 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 11 on the third floor of the academic center. \n \nA $10 Winter Carnival button is required for entry, and heavy appetizers and refreshments will be served. \n \nThe program will be followed by viewing of the Winter Carnival fireworks. \n \nParking is limited. For more information and to RSVP, call 970-870-4423 or visit cmcbecauseofyou.org/campus-celebrations/ . \n \nAnyone interested in sharing or reading stories of the people who\u2019ve created and shaped Colorado Mountain College is invited to visit cmcbecauseofyou.org . \n  \n\u201cAt the time, there wasn\u2019t money for construction,\u201d said John Vickery, another Leadville transplant who arrived in Steamboat in 1982 to serve as dean of instruction and later, campus dean from 1988 to 2000. \n \nIn the late 1980s, CMC worked to strengthen its transfer programs, ensuring students could easily transition into four-year universities after completing their two years at CMC. \n \nA modern campus \n \nBy the early 1990s, a recovered economy made way for new construction at CMC\u2019s Steamboat campus. Bristol Hall, which housed offices, classrooms, the library and central administration, was built in 1992. A physical plant, the Anderson building, was constructed in 1995, and in 1997, a dormitory named Hill Hall was completed. \n \nEach of those buildings still stands on the 65-acre campus today. \n \nFast forward to 2011, and there were two significant milestones for CMC\u2019s Steamboat Springs campus \u2014 ground was broken on a new $18 million, 60,000-square-foot academic center, and the college received accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission to offer its first bachelor\u2019s degrees in sustainability studies and business administration. \n \nBagwell, who retired in 2013, said he was surprised and pleased when the college pursued the option of awarding bachelor\u2019s degrees. \n \n\u201cI was very pleased to see it happen here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was always Lucy\u2019s intent.\u201d \n \nThe completed academic center was built with the community in mind, with popular fitness classes taught just off the building\u2019s front entrance, the third floor\u2019s Neas Dining Hall and a coffee shop open to the public and the Albright Auditorium regularly hosting public events. \n \nThe Yampa Valley Entrepreneurship Center, which helps students and community members alike in their pursuits to start new small businesses, sits on the center\u2019s second floor. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s really a community resource,\u201d said Vickery, who retired from CMC in 2000 but has twice served as the campus\u2019 interim dean during transitions. \n \nA state-of-the art kitchen on the building\u2019s third floor has allowed the campus to expand its culinary arts program and offer dozens of community cooking courses annually. \n \nToday, CMC\u2019s Steamboat Springs campus employs more than 100 full-time faculty and 400 full-time staff, as well as more than 600 part-time faculty and staff members. \n \nTogether, they serve more than 2,500 credit and non-credit students each year, and in 2016, the college awarded Steamboat Springs students 24 bachelor\u2019s degrees, 91 associate\u2019s degrees and 57 certificates. \n \nTo reach Teresa Ristow, call 970-871-4206, email tristow@SteamboatToday.com or follow her on Twitter @TeresaRistow","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"College on the hill: Celebrating the history of Colorado Mountain College Steamboat Springs","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Routt","zipCode":"80487","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Steamboat Springs","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Steamboat Pilot & Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169779048","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"15"},"name":"Steamboat Pilot & Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.steamboatpilot.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://cmcbecauseofyou.org/campus-celebrations/","http://cmcbecauseofyou.org/","https://twitter.com/teresaristow"],"sequenceId":"695204131833","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

At New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, some of the 2,000 demonstrators chanted \"Let them in, let them in!\" \n\n- Better US-Russia ties? - \n\nTrump's friendly stance toward Putin, whom France and Germany accuse of seeking to undermine Western unity, is being scrutinized since he won the US election in November. \n\nThe White House hailed the call with Putin as a \"significant start\" to better US-Russia ties, while the Kremlin said the pair agreed to develop relations \"as equals\" and to establish \"real coordination\" against the Islamic State group. \n\nTrump took office last week with US-Russia relations at new Cold War-level lows amid accusations by American intelligence agencies that the Kremlin hacked Democratic Party emails as part of a pro-Trump campaign to influence November's election. \n\nThe president -- who has raised the prospect of easing sanctions imposed against Russia after its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 -- has cast doubt on whether Russia meddled in the election. \n\nIn a flurry of calls that began early in the morning and rounded out an already frantically paced week, Trump spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Putin, Hollande and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. \n\nThe conversations gave the US president an early opportunity to explain new policies that have baffled and unnerved much of the rest of the world -- particularly his order to temporarily halt all refugee arrivals and those of travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n\nEuropean leaders are also concerned about Trump's virulent criticism of NATO -- he has dubbed the transatlantic military alliance \"obsolete\" -- at a time when it stands as the main defense against Putin. \n\nBut in his call with Merkel, Trump agreed on NATO's \"fundamental importance,\" the White House said. \n\nThe United States provides significant funding to NATO, and Trump has urged other member nations to step up their contributions. \n\n- 'Extreme vetting' - \n\nTrump's pronouncement on Muslim immigration makes good on one of his most controversial campaign promises to subject travelers from Islamic countries to \"extreme vetting,\" which he declared would make America safe from \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n\n\"It's not a Muslim ban,\" Trump insisted. \n\n\"It's working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\" he told reporters. \n\nThe new protocols specifically bar Syrian refugees from the United States indefinitely, or until the president himself decides that they no longer pose a threat. \n\nThe legal challenge, which won a first battle in US District Court in New York, was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups after two Iraqi men were detained late Friday at JFK. \n\n- 'Greatest nation' - \n\nOne of the men, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, had worked for the US government in Iraq for 10 years. \n\n\"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world,\" Darweesh said after his release. \n\nMark Doss, a supervising attorney at the International Refugee Project at the Urban Justice Center, said Darweesh's detention and release showed the new policy was being implemented \"with no guidance.\" \n\nThe ban has also triggered a political backlash. \n\n\"To my colleagues: don't ever again lecture me on American moral leadership if you chose to be silent today,\" Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, tweeted late Friday. \n\nHis tweet was accompanied by the now iconic photograph of Aylan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian boy whose body washed up on a beach in Turkey in 2015 after a failed attempt to flee Syria's brutal war to join relatives in Canada. \n\nInternational groups and civil liberties organizations have roundly condemned Trump's orders. \n\n\"'Extreme vetting' is just a euphemism for discriminating against Muslims,\" said ACLU executive director Anthony Romero. \n\nRomero said Trump's order breached the US constitution's ban on religious discrimination by choosing countries with Muslim majorities for tougher treatment. \n\nIran answered in kind by saying it would ban Americans from entering the country, calling Trump's action insulting. \n\nBut the US leader did get backing from Czech President Milos Zeman, who praised him for being \"concerned with the safety of his citizens.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"International relations news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump vows better Russia ties, reassures NATO allies","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Yahoo!

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"40202","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Louisville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Louisville Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"540"},"name":"Louisville Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204135989","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The lung has been reported among the most frequent sites of infection in patients with rheumatic disease, who are susceptible to developing pneumonia sustained both by common pathogens and by opportunistic microorganisms. Patients with rheumatic disease show a peculiar vulnerability to infectious complications. This is due in part to intrinsic disease-related immune dysregulation and in part to the immunosuppressive treatments. Several therapeutic agents have been associated to a wide spectrum of infections, complicating the management of rheumatic diseases. This review discusses the most frequent pulmonary infections encountered in rheumatic diseases, focusing on opportunistic agents, consequent diagnostic challenges and appropriate therapeutic strategies. \n This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

The main aim of this study was to obtain antioxidant-enriched fractions from the common seaweed Fucus spiralis and evaluate their activity and efficiency in protecting human cells (MCF-7 cells) on an oxidative stress condition induced by H 2 O 2 . Five fractions, F1\u2013F5, were obtained by reversed-phase vacuum liquid chromatography. F3, F4 and F5 revealed the highest phlorotannin content, also showing the strongest antioxidant effects. The cell death induced by H 2 O 2 was reduced by all fractions following the potency order F4 > F2 > F3 > F5 > F1. Only fraction F4 completely inhibited the H 2 O 2 effect. To understand the possible mechanisms of action of these fractions, the cellular production of H 2 O 2 , the mitochondrial membrane potential and the caspase 9 activity were studied. Fractions F3 and F4 presented the highest reduction on H 2 O 2 cell production. All fractions decreased both caspase-9 activity and cell membrane depolarization (except F1). Taken all together, the edible F. spiralis reveal that they provide protection against oxidative stress induced by H 2 O 2 on the human MCF-7 cellular model, probably acting as upstream blockers of apoptosis. \n This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

The disorder is associated with various signs and symptoms which are also common for the general population not suffering from compound hypersecretion. Thus, more sensitive and selective methods are required for the diagnosis of CS. This follow-up study was conducted to determine which steroid metabolites could serve as potential indicators of CS and possible subclinical hypercortisolism in patients diagnosed with so called non-functioning adrenal incidentalomas (AIs). Urine samples from negative controls ( n = 37), patients with CS characterized by hypercortisolism and excluding iatrogenic CS ( n = 16), and patients with non-functioning AIs with possible subclinical Cushing\u2019s syndrome ( n = 25) were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and gas chromatograph equipped with flame ionization detector (GC/FID). Statistical and multivariate methods were applied to investigate the profile differences between examined individuals. The analyses revealed hormonal differences between patients with CS and the rest of examined individuals. The concentrations of selected metabolites of cortisol, androgens, and pregnenetriol were elevated whereas the levels of tetrahydrocortisone were decreased for CS when opposed to the rest of the study population. Moreover, after analysis of potential confounding factors, it was also possible to distinguish six steroid hormones which discriminated CS patients from other study subjects. The obtained discriminant functions enabled classification of CS patients and AI group characterized by mild hypersecretion of cortisol metabolites. It can be concluded that steroid hormones selected by applying urinary profiling may serve the role of potential biomarkers of CS and can aid in its early diagnosis. \n This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

Several of the committees yet to hear a bill are led by new chairmen.\n\nRep. Ben Smaltz, R-Auburn, was appointed to run House Public Policy in November and said that late appointment caused a delay.\n\nHe said usually bill authors would be running ideas and concepts past chairmen over the summer and working to draft the bills in a clean form.\n\n\u201cI had to take an extra deep dive on issues that I feel responsible for,\u201d Smaltz said. \u201cThese are very weighty issues that deserve a lot of effort.\u201d\n\nSenate President Pro Tem David Long, R-Fort Wayne, also said the first few weeks have been complicated by other events.\n\nThe State of the State and State of the Judiciary addresses occur every year. But there was also an inauguration of a new governor as well as Vice President Mike Pence, which resulted in several missed session days.\n\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t get traction until this week,\u201d Long said. \u201cWe will see all the committees in action in the near future.\u201d\n\nHe noted there is still time for them to have three or four meetings before the first deadline of the session. Ultimately work has to be wrapped up by April 29.\n\nFort Wayne native Marc Lotter has been named special assistant to President Donald Trump and press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nLotter is among five people from Indiana whose appointments to the Trump-Pence administration were announced Wednesday.\n\nLotter, a 1988 graduate of Snider High School, was deputy campaign manager for Pence\u2019s gubernatorial re-election campaign last year, then became national press secretary for Pence after Indiana\u2019s then-governor became Trump\u2019s running mate.\n\nHe previously was director of external communications for the Indiana State Board of Education, communications director for Indi­anapo­lis Mayor Greg Ballard, communications director in the first term of Gov. Mitch Daniels and press secretary for Daniels\u2019 first campaign for governor.\n\nThree people who had worked for Pence when he was governor were named Wednesday to his Washington staff: Zach Bauer, Kara Brooks and Lani Czarniecki.\n\nBauer is special assistant to Pence; Brooks is deputy assistant to Pence and communications director for Karen Pence; and Czarniecki is the vice president\u2019s deputy assistant for external affairs.\n\nMatt Morgan was appointed Pence\u2019s deputy assistant and deputy counsel. Morgan was a partner in the In­di­anapo­lis office of law firm Barnes & Thornburg and counsel to Pence\u2019s gubernatorial re-election campaign.\n\nChurubusco Clerk-Treasurer Madalyn Sade-Bartl has been elected chairwoman of the 3rd Congressional District Democratic Party.\n\nSade-Bartl defeated Steuben County Democratic Chairwoman Judy Rowe by a 13-6 vote taken Sunday in Bluffton in a special caucus of county Democratic chairs and vice chairs.\n\nSade-Bartl replaces Carmen Darland, who resigned this month after eight years as district chairwoman. Sade-Bartl will stand for re-election at the party\u2019s March reorganization caucus.\n\nSade-Bartl had been the Democrats\u2019 treasurer. Allen County resident Benjamin Johnson ran unopposed Sunday to replace her.\n\nJohnson works at the General Motors pickup assembly plant in southwest Allen County and is a member of the executive board of United Auto Workers Local 2209.\n\nThe 3rd District is a heavily Republican region consisting of 10 counties in northeast Indiana and parts of two other counties.\n\nSade-Bartl, 35, said Monday in a telephone interview that she wants to increase community outreach efforts by Democrats and better recognize the party\u2019s volunteers.\n\n\u201cThe volunteer hours are what win campaigns,\u201d she said. \u201cI think making our volunteers feel more appreciated is something that I really want to start doing.\u201d\n\nDarland, who said she announced last April that she would resign after the November general election, will remain vice chair of the Noble County Democratic Party and co-chair of the Indiana Democratic Party\u2019s Emerging Leaders Project.\n\nThe Indiana House of Representatives is No. 1, according to the American Conservative Union Foundation.\n\nThe group congratulated the 100 members of the House \u2013 70 Republicans and 30 Democrats \u2013 for leading the country in the effort to enact conservative policy solutions in the 2016 session.\n\nACU will award the members of the Indiana House our \u201cMost Conservative House of Representatives\u201d Award at a conference in February.\n\nThe award is given to the representative chamber with the most conservative score in the country. Indiana\u2019s House received a 75 percent conservative rating. Indiana\u2019s Senate ranked third overall, with an average of 69 percent.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Niki Kelly and Brian Francisco"},"topics":[{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Several legislative committees yet to meet","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Marion","zipCode":"46204","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indianapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Journal-Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657677","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1517"},"name":"Journal-Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.journalgazette.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204142201","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T21:41:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Forrester predicts that Australian technology buyers in business and government will exercise caution as the uncertainties of the world economy unfold in the upcoming year.\n\nAccording to the research firm\u2019s report, the entire Asia Pacific tech market, once the fastest-growing tech market in the world, is slowing down, and it forecasts only moderate growth for APAC this year in line with slowing economies in most markets in the region,\n\nIn 2017, around half of the tech investment in Australia will go to software, tech outsourcing, and consulting services, says Forrester, which also notes that Australian businesses have made \"deep investments\" in digitising CX and will begin to master digital operational excellence in 2017.\n\nForrester also says that around 36% of businesses in ANZ have invested in machine-to-machine or IoT solutions or will do so over the next 12 months to automate or optimise the back end or to create new revenue opportunities from existing or new products or services.\n\nBut, it\u2019s not all gloom and doom for the sale of products and services across the wider Asia Pacific region, with Forrester predicting that the lacklustre 3% growth it forecasts for 2017 will be followed by faster growth of 5.7% in 2018.\n\nAnd, while Japan is still the largest tech market, Forrester says that other markets are growing faster. Japan is expected to spend US$248 billion on tech goods and services in 2017, which is the largest among all Asia Pacific countries, And Forrester says China is not far behind and will grow much faster - while India is a distant third but will have the fastest growth.\n\nForrester says software and services will lead Asia Pacific tech market growth and, while telecom services will remain the largest area of spending, it will be flat or grow by 2% to 4% in constant currency terms.\n\nComputer equipment, the second-largest tech category in Asia Pacific, will grow by 5% and 6% in US dollars and 3% and 6% in constant currencies.\n\nBut, Forrester also notes that while software and tech consulting services have become two of the largest and fastest-growing tech budget categories in the US and Europe, the APAC region has not reached this point yet, \"as many countries are still assembling the hardware infrastructure that underpins modern technology\". \"But it is heading in that direction, with software becoming the third- largest tech market category in the region,\" Forrester says.\n\n\"Few Asia Pacific markets have the maturity to embrace the business technology (BT) agenda to the same extent as the US,\" Forrester says, noting that the BT agenda includes technologies that help firms \"win, serve, and retain customers\".\n\n\"BT accounts for 14% of Asia Pacific tech spending, versus 32% in the US. BT spending will grow much faster than IT spending through 2018 as firms work to meet the changing expectations of empowered customers,\" the report notes.\n\nGlobally, Forrester\u2019s outlook for the tech market for 2017-2018 is for just 3% to 4% growth \"as forces of disruption battle with forces of continuity\".\n\nAccording to Forrester, with the US dollar strengthening against most currencies in 2017 but likely to lose ground in 2018, global tech market growth in US dollars will be 2.8% in 2017 and 4.7% in 2018.\n\nOne of the main forces of disruption is the shift toward populist, anti-globalisation governments in the US, UK, and other European countries, The Brexit vote in the UK and the election of Donald Trump in the US have introduced major uncertainties in the economic outlook for these key tech markets, and for their trading partners -- uncertainties that will lead to caution in firms' tech buying,\" notes Forrester analyst Andrew Bartel.\n\n\"The prospects for better economic growth are brighter for the US due to the stimulus from likely tax cuts and increases in infrastructure spending,\" Bartel notes in a blog on the Forrester website.\n\n\"As a result, we project that the US tech market will have one of the strongest growths at 4.3% in 2017 and 4.8% in 2018.

They are accompanied by a vibrant, live \norchestra. \n \nIndividually, cast members\u2019 have rangy, expressive voices. But like the \npainting technique at the center of the musical, the individual voices \nbeautifully coalesce, especially to sing the show\u2019s best \nsong, the stately \u201cSunday.\u201d \n \nOn several Sundays during the late 1800s, French painter Georges \nSeurat gathers at a park on an island in the Seine river to prepare his \nnotable painting \u201cA Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La \nGrande Jatte.\u201d Sound effects of chirping birds, created by sound \ndesigner Dan Mayer, reinforce the serene atmosphere. \n \nSeurat created the work, considered his most famous, in the form of a \npainting technique called Pointillism. It involves small, separate dots of \ncolor applied in patterns to form an image. \n \nThe image mostly comprises members of the French bourgeoisie \nrelaxing on lazy, sunny Sundays on the island. \n \nIn the show, the painting\u2019s subjects spring to life, commenting on \nvarious subjects, including Seurat\u2019s endless concentration \nwhile he works to paint likenesses of the people \nDirector Meltzer\u2019s smart staging includes ensuring a separation exists \non-stage between the aloof Seurat (Cooper Grodin) and the rest of the \ncharacters. \n \nWith his dark hair, beard, black costume, lowered eyebrows and sharp, \nbossy voice, Grodin projects a brooding, even dictatorial air. He\u2019s \ncommanding toward those he is painting, particularly his love interest, \nDot (Kimberly Doreen Burns). It\u2019s clear his Seurat is deeply \ncommitted to \u201cFinishing the Hat.\u201d \n \nGrodin projects a dark and serious aura without making his character \nunlikable. Like his painting, his performance is multi-colored, with \ninjections of charm and playfulness. \n \nAs Dot, Kimberly Doreen Burns invests her character with impatience \nand exasperation at Seurat\u2019s demands and neglect of her. But Burns \nalso communicates her character\u2019s devotion to Seurat, at one point \nseductively touching his body from the top to the bottom, as though \nhe\u2019s a work of art himself. \n \nThe first act takes place in 1884, while the second fast forwards to a \nmuseum in 1984 New York City. \nIn the latter, Georges\u2019 great-grandson, named George, is a struggling \npainter trying to preserve his ancestor\u2019s painting. With him is Georges\u2019 \nand Dot\u2019s now-elderly daughter, Marie (also played by Burns, who \nlooks too young and acts too vibrant in the role). \nThe importance of art as a family legacy and the challenge of \nproducing art are among the timeless themes in Act II. \nGeorge is played by Grodin with a strong sense of commitment and a \nsense he\u2019s burdened by the hard task of producing art. Grodin makes it \nclear there\u2019s a weight on this man\u2019s shoulders to preserve his great- \ngrandfather\u2019s legacy. \n \n\u201cArt isn\u2019t easy,\u201d are lyrics that are repeated in the song \u201cPutting it \nTogether.\u201d It\u2019s sung by Multiple characters, including George. The song, \nlike others in the musical, showcases Sondheim\u2019s brilliant rhymes and \nelegant lyrics. \n \nPerhaps the lyrics that really draw us into the musical are the following: \n\u201cWhite. A blank page of canvas\u2026So many possibilities.\u201d \nIn Zoetic\u2019s production, George sings the lyrics \u201cSo many possibilities,\u201d \nin a whisper, but with an ardent enthusiasm suggesting a treasure \nchest\u2019s worth of tempting choices. \nMaybe art\u2019s infinite possibilities make it so tempting to try to create.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Aaron Krause"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: theater news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Sunday in the Park with George","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Culturevulture.net","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169757594","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Culturevulture.net","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer","Theater"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.culturevulture.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204142756","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:47:14Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It is hygroscopic and absorbs ~29 wt % water in the bulk when exposed to water vapor but, more importantly, it forms a hydrated and passivating surface layer when immersed in liquid water. In the latter case, CeO 2 initially undergoes direct and/or reductive dissolution, followed by the establishment of a passivating layer calculated to consist of ~69 mol % solid CeO 2 ·2H 2 O and ~30 mol % gelled Ce(OH) 4 . Under static flow conditions, a saturated boundary layer also forms but, under turbulent flow conditions, this is removed. While the passivating hydrated surface layer, which is coherent probably owing to the continuous Ce(OH) 4 gel, would be expected to eliminate the photoactivity, this does not occur. This apparent anomaly is explained by the calculation of (a) the thermodynamic stability diagrams for Ce and Fe; (b) the speciation diagrams for the Ce 4+ -H 2 O, Ce 3+ -H 2 O, Fe 3+ -H 2 O, and Fe 2+ -H 2 O systems; and (c) the Pourbaix diagrams for the Ce-H 2 O and Fe-H 2 O systems. Furthermore, consideration of the probable effects of the localized chemical and redox equilibria owing to the establishment of a very low pH (<0) at the liquid-solid interface also is important to the interpretation of the phenomena. These factors highlight the critical importance of the establishment of the passivating surface layer and its role in photocatalysis. A model for the mechanism of photocatalysis by the CeO 2 component of the hydrated phase CeO 2 ·2H 2 O is proposed, explaining the observation of the retention of photocatalysis following the apparent alteration of the surface of CeO 2 upon hydration. The model involves the generation of charge carriers at the outer surface of the hydrated surface layer, followed by the formation of radicals, which decompose organic species that have diffused through the boundary layer, if present. \n This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 58 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hinds","zipCode":"39209","state":"Mississippi","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jackson","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"16 WAPT","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681288","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"173"},"name":"16 WAPT","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wapt.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204148920","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

With the new powertrain, the carmaker promises to boost performance and refinement while reducing fuel consumption and emissions when compared with the current model. \n\nThe adoption of an advanced 48V electrical system and integrated starter motor on the new hot hatchback is part of a powertrain overhaul that will be reflected across the whole Mk8 Golf line-up. The changes are also set to make the new model the most powerful series-production Golf GTI yet. \n\nAlthough the new Golf GTI is still three years away from its introduction in international markets, sources close to Volkswagen research and development boss, Frank Welsch, have revealed to our sister publication Autocar UK that the initial performance targets point to a power output similar to the 265hp of the limited-edition Golf GTI Clubsport. \n\nThe new Gold GTI will continue to use an internal combustion engine \u2013 Volkswagen\u2019s familiar turbocharged 2.0-litre petrol unit. However, the introduction of the 48V electric system will allow the four-cylinder engine to receive comprehensive modifications.

She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

The iHeart80s Party rocked the SAP Center in San Jose, California with a star-studded lineup of artists including New Kids on the Block , UB40 Featuring Ali Campbell, Astro and Mickey, Colin Hay of   Men At Work , Rick Astley , Starship ,  Eddie Money , and Night Ranger . And it was all hosted by iconic MTV personality Martha Quinn, who hosts the iHeart80s Radio's weekday morning show. \n \n{ \"position1\" : { \"type\" : \"live\", \"id\" : 5060, \"name\" : \"iHeart80s Radio\", \"description\" : \"Commercial-Free 80s Hits\" } } \n \nThe night was filled with some RAD moments from all of the performances of the night, amazing fan reactions, special guests, and more. Check out the best moments from the show below: \n Candace Cameron Bure -- AKA D.J. TANNER -- Helped Kick Off The Night By Introducing New Kids On The Block  \nIn case you didn\u2019t know, Candace is a huge NKOTB fan, and has been over the last 30 years. The band and Bure united on her show Fuller House , so there was no one better to introduce the band and kick off the show than D.J. Tanner herself. \n   New Kids On The Block Brought All The Right Stuff  \nNew Kids On The Block are one of the O.G. boybands, and after over 30 years of performing together, the guys still have  the right stuff . NKOTB took the stage to perform hits like \u201cStep By Step,\u201d \u201cYou Got It (The Right Stuff),\u201d and more, and brought all of their amazing dance moves with them. And yes, we\u2019re talking about those classic steps you learned from watching their music videos. \n Also, the NKOTB fans were out in FULL FORCE. Donnie couldn\u2019t resist\u2026  Starship Reminds Us \u201cWe are all citizens of the world.\u201d  \nAt the very end of their performance at the 2017 iHeart80s Party, which also happened to be the day as President Donald Trump\u2019s Immigration Ban which sparked protests across the country, Starship lead singer Mickey Thomas simply told the crowd, \u201cRemember, we are all citizens of the world.\u201d \n  \n. @starshipcontrol is giving us life right now! \"Remember we are all citizens of the WORLD!\" #iheart80s  pic.twitter.com/y0MS7c5uPK \n\u2014 iHeartRadio (@iHeartRadio) January 29, 2017  Rick Astley Opened His Set With A Classic Rickroll  \nAstley kicked off his set with a classic Rickroll by leading fans to believe he was going to open with \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up\u201d by having his band play the instrumentals, but instead he kicked things off with his Whenever You Need Somebody single \u201cTogether Forever.\u201d Also during his set, the \u201880s icon, who turns 50 on February 6th, made jokes about his age and blamed it for his lack of dance numbers and inability to play high-energy songs back-to-back. \n UB40\u2019s \u201cRed Red Wine\u201d Had Everybody Feeling So Fine  \nUB40  Featuring Ali Campbell, Astro and Mickey  took us all back to 1983 with their hit \u201cRed Red Wine.\u201d The crowd went wild during the band\u2019s performance of the beloved tune -- everybody was feeling it. \n  \nRed red wine has everybody feeling so fine #iheart80s  pic.twitter.com/Zf5PhZcv0A \n\u2014 iHeartRadio (@iHeartRadio) January 29, 2017  Not to mention the band themselves\u2026   \nTime to sway.   @WeAreUB40 takes the stage now at our #iHeart80sParty in San Jose!

Yes, I know, you were never allowed to say Kaddish for your oldest sister, since I was stillborn. Why is that? To spare the family's feelings lest the memory of losing me prove too painful to recall? I am your big sister only in age, for I never reached the size you did. But that is a mere physical detail, and we millions here in limbo don't set much store by the physical. We understand how quickly it fades in God's timeless eternity. Even if I tried to explain what it's like here, it's doubtful I would succeed, for those who have never been here, thank God, would find the place unbelievable. \n \nHow lightly you who are fated to be born, live and die toss around the word \"unbelievable\"--as in \"What an unbelievable return Pancho Gonzales just made to Jack Kramer's serve!\" What's unbelievable is the river of time and eternity that carries us all along. For there's no turning back this eternal clock whose hands move in only one direction: clockwise, of course. \n \nYes, I know, the theoretical physicists play games with alternate universes and some of our own sages speak of worlds that existed before this one and that the Lord God, blessed be His name, created till He got this universe right. Or as right as He could, for even nature and nature's God have been known to make mistakes. I'm one of them, a kindly doctor told our mother and father, doubtless meaning to soften the blow but only making it harder. What fools these mortals be, as the great poet-playwright of your earthly language, English, put it. \n \nLope de Vega, whose earthly medium was Spanish, warned us that La Vida es un sueno , life is a dream. But be assured, dear brother, it is worth all the deaths in your world put together. For there is nothing like it, however fleeting. Seize it with both hands and live as long and fully as you can. \n \nHow I envy you, and how I pity you at the same time. For the lightness of being is incomparably better, for all its burdens and distractions, than what we here can only imagine. We don't even have names, and our shrouds long ago became as immaterial as we now are. I understand Pa was buried in his Masonic garb, which would be just like him. A true American, he was always a hail fellow, well met even if he was on intimate terms with the angel of death, for he served on the Chevra Kadisha, the minyan that saw to the burial of the dead for half a century in Shreveport, La., Western Hemisphere, Planet Earth, Alpha Centauri Cluster. \n \nWhat speculation on top of speculation goes on in your little world. We here in limbo have plenty of time, an endless supply of it, to dwell on timelessness. But you don't, having things to do, people to see, assignments holy and maybe unholy to carry out. Never mind. All that can wait--and will. For you mortals don't have forever in your brief space between life and death. Which is just what makes that passing moment so valuable. You won't come this way again. Do what good you can and steer clear of the evil that tempts you all around. He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? Which may sound simple, but is anything but. Words don't have an easy time catching up with deeds even here in what might pass among the unknowing as heaven. \n \nWe seldom dream here, but when we do, it may be of those like you whom we had to leave behind after only the briefest time, and yet that time shines like a jewel that illumines our entire non-existence. Yes, we are permitted to pray here. Indeed, our one claim to an identity is prayer, for there is only one bridge between past and present, between thee and me, dear brother, and that bridge is called love, and to hold fast to it is the surest way to see one another again. In the flesh? Maybe, maybe not. Let us leave such recondite matters to those interested in them. What you and I know and will always know is that we're part of the same family. And what a grand family reunion it will be when we all meet again on that far shore, and welcome the generations yet to be. \n \nLove, \n \nNameless \n \nPaul Greenberg is the Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial writer and columnist for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. \n \nEditorial on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[],"title":"Letter from limbo","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204160352","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:21Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Some are for sale at RadRitual. In particular, soaps and \"bath bombs\" with crystals inside have been quite popular, owner Chloe Nordlander says.

They have never been good about managing money. They are both retired now and on a fixed income, and they have been asking me or one of my four adult siblings for money to help with their bills each month. \n \nI don't mind giving, but recently my siblings and I have become annoyed because, while they continue to ask for money, at the same time they are also taking short trips, which include hotels and rental cars, and inviting friends out to dinner. \n \nThey also have a storage locker full of junk that eats up several hundred dollars a month. We have offered to help them clean out the locker, and possibly make money from some of the items in there, but they never commit.

You and your siblings are good children, but it's time for an intervention. Before giving your parents more money, you should all sit down with them and help them to create a budget, taking into account their fixed income and what you children can afford as a supplement. Then tell your parents they must live within that budget. Period. Their expenses must be trimmed, and the storage unit would be an excellent place to start. \n \nDEAR ABBY: How do you discourage someone's friendliness without being rude? \n \nAn elderly man recently moved in with his family in our neighborhood.

The last time I was outside with my three kids, he approached with a stack of photos and proceeded to show me at least 100 prints of a trip he had taken abroad -- 10 years ago. \n \nI feel trapped because I don't want to be mean to an old man, but I dread seeing him stroll down the road. What is the best way to deal with this situation? \n \n-- Wanting to Withdraw \n \nDEAR WANTING: The poor man is probably lonely and looking for human contact. Because you are not prepared to engage in his \"neighborly\" conversations, the next time he strolls by, tell him that you do not have time to chat right now. If he knocks on your door, tell him that you are busy or that you will be leaving shortly. And suggest to him that he may want to find a senior center so that he can make friends with contemporaries and won't feel so isolated. \n \nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln--along with untold millions of men and women who nurtured and harvested the seeds they planted--deserve our gratitude and our labor in service of their vision. \n \nToday is not the celebration of a political victory. Nor is it a celebration of democracy. It would be disingenuous of me not to acknowledge that if today were a celebration of pure democracy, Secretary Clinton would be standing here. And I would be sitting at home. Today is a statement that our system is not perfect, but it works. It is a celebration of our Republic form of government. While I am a latecomer to championing the Electoral College--and it might sound self-serving that I do--I am glad to have won this election and I am ready to meet the challenges ahead of us. \n \nI am one of the few presidents in U.S. history to inherit an economy stronger than the economy inherited by his predecessor. President Obama, while I do not agree with many of your policies, nor do I share much of your philosophy, I want to say, on behalf of our country, thank you for stewarding our economy back from the brink. You had to play defense. Now we must play offense. \n \nI've been fortunate in business. A mind for business is the asset that I bring to the Oval Office. But it is also a potential liability. Measuring and managing assets and liabilities is a key part of building and growing a business. So I have to remember going forward that America is a corporation--there is a business component to running the country--but it is not just a corporation. It is also a cause, and that cause is freedom. America is also a community, and that community is diverse and has a multitude of needs. Some of those needs create conflict and require patience and thoughtful solutions. The work ahead of us is both challenging and worthwhile. \n \nWe want the corporation of American government to be lean and strong. We want it to thrive with efficiency and effectiveness. But we must be vigilant that the corporation of America serves America's cause of freedom and America's diverse community. It cannot be the other way around. If the price for America's way of doing business is the loss of freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution or the oppression of our community, then the price is too high and the return on investment too low. \n \nAs your president, I promise these three questions will be the filter through which we run our policy decisions and the criteria upon which we base our actions: \n \n\u2022 Does it protect and serve the community of America and the world in which we live? \n \n\u2022 Does it protect and promote the freedoms guaranteed to Americans by our Constitution? \n \n\u2022 Does it make sense in both the short term and long term, and will it make our way of governing healthier and more effective? \n \nI would like to promise that I will never let you down. But that would be a hollow and vain promise. I am surely going to let you down from time to time. I ask you to pray for me that when I do fail, I will have the humility to acknowledge it and the courage to correct my mistakes. \n \nAt any given time in the next four years some Americans will be disappointed by what this government does, while others will be happy. One of my goals in leading this great nation is to not keep disappointing the same group of Americans. No single group should bear the burden of making America great. No small group should hoard all the blessings of America's greatness. \n \nI talked a lot on the campaign trail about radical Islamic terrorism. I want to say something now about radical extremist patriotism: We don't need it. Uniformity is not the same thing as unity. We need unity. We do not need uniformity. We need dissenting opinions. We need peaceful protest. The history of our country is not built on the backs of mindless drones serving a dictator. Our shared history is populated with men and women who engaged in debate until the best idea won. Then that idea was put to the test in the real world and celebrated when it worked or taken back to the drawing board when it did not. \n \nI do not call on you to sacrifice your voice to the religion of patriotism. I call on you to be patriotic. Raise your voice when you see injustice. Lend your voice to those who have none. Lift your voice in praise of all that is good and right about our people and our country. \n \nGod bless you all, and God bless the United States of America. \n \nTim Jackson of Little Rock is a filmmaker whose imagination is rivaled by reality these days. \n \nEditorial on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"TIM JACKSON Special to the Democrat-Gazette"},"topics":[],"title":"The inaugural address that could have been","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204163001","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:11:46Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The debate is one that the U.S. Supreme Court has avoided for decades. But recently, in a case called Lee v. Tam, the justices heard argument on the question. Let's hope they come out in favor of the First Amendment. \n \nLee v. Tam involves the Slants, a dance-rock band from the Portland, Ore., area. All the members are Asian American. In 2011 the group filed an application to register its name as a mark. The application was denied on the ground that \"Slants\" would be offensive to large numbers of Asian Americans. The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board upheld the refusal, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the decision. \n \nThe judges did not dispute that the mark was offensive. Instead, they ruled that the prohibition on federal registration of disparaging marks violates the First Amendment. Trademarks are a form of expressive speech, the panel wrote, and the government cannot penalize speech because it happens to dislike the message. \n \nIt's plain that the band sees its name as a message. Founder Simon Shiao Tam has explained that by naming his band the Slants, he was attempting a \"reappropriation,\" by which a group seizes control of a disparaging word or phrase, and converts it to a term of pride. Said Tam: \"We want to take on these stereotypes that people have about us, like the slanted eyes, and own them.\" \n \nThe Patent and Trademark Office has developed a special test for a proposed mark that \"is found to refer to identifiable persons, institutions, beliefs or national symbols.\" Registration will be denied when the mark's meaning \"may be disparaging to a substantial composite of the referenced group.\" The best-known example of the struggle over how to apply this test is the continuing litigation over the registration of marks owned by the Washington Redskins. \n \nThe ban on registration of offensive marks is largely a relic of the years after World War II, when it was just one among many rules that the U.S. developed to enforce a certain public moral hegemony. Many libraries refused to carry Invisible Man and The Catcher in the Rye. \n \nIt's time for a change. We live in a different world now, one in which the protection of speech has become considerably more robust. True, we also live in a world in which advocacy of censoring the offensive has become depressingly popular, especially on the left. What's striking about Lee v. Tam is how different the support has been from the litigation challenging the Redskins trademark, where much of the left has been siding with the mark's rejection. \n \nSome supporters of the band, struggling to thread the identity politics needle, have argued that registration of an otherwise offensive term for an ethnic group should be permitted when the mark is used by members of the group. Under this theory, only outsiders should be unable to register the mark. This approach would suggest, for example, that the Redskins mark would be fine if used by a Native American team. (And some Native American teams do use it.) But it's not at all an attractive solution. The last thing we need is a Patent and Trademark Office that sorts applications according to the race or ethnicity of the applicant. \n \nWe're better off facing squarely the First Amendment issue raised by Tam's \"reappropriation\": Should the federal government have the authority to deny the privileges that come with registration because it dislikes the message a mark expresses?

Some are superbly accurate, and some are gorgeous, but the stories behind them are what make them special. \n \nThe most remarkable gun I ever had was a Grade III Browning Auto-5 Light 12. I found it at Gene Sears gun shop in El Reno, Okla., in 1999. It had a solid gold FN (Fabrique Nationale) inlay at the back of the hump, and it was hand engraved with a 26-inch, improved cylinder barrel. It was in the box and had never been assembled. \n \nIt was also way beyond my means. I wrote down the serial number and discovered it was manufactured in 1940, before the Wehrmacht overran Belgium. \n \nIn 2001, I sold my house in Oklahoma City. After closing, I drove to El Reno, and naturally the gun was gone. Mr. Sears asked whether I wanted to see anything, and I lamented missing out on that Auto-5. \n \n\"Aw, hell no!\" Sears said. \"I can't get anyone to look at the thing.\" \n \nIt was buried under a pile of shirts and jackets. He lowered the price considerably, but he finally held firm when my eyes betrayed that he had me. \n \nIt was one of the most beautiful guns I've ever seen, and a true once-in-a-lifetime gem. A gentleman in Wheatley talked me out of it, but I would sure like to see it one more time. \n \nAnother is a Browning Hi-Power 9mm with a T-preface serial number. The T series was the top of the line Hi-Powers, with the best finish and the best triggers. Side by side with any other Hi-Power, the differences were obvious. \n \nAs often happens, I showed it to a Hi-Power enthusiast, and it became part of his collection. \n \nThen, there was the Winchester 101 that I got in a trade with Richard Hatcher, who recently retired as director of the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation. \n \nHatcher was assistant director at that time, and Greg Duffy was director. I was in Duffy's office showing him a remarkable Ruger Red Label 28-gauge when Hatcher walked in. \n \nA few days later, my phone rang. It was Hatcher inviting me to lunch. \n \nWe drove around town as he made several offers. I drove a hard bargain, never letting on that I despised that Red Label. Warren Montague once took it away from me during a bird hunt in Kansas when I was on the verge of wrapping it around a tree. He finally offered his prize Winchester 101 and a little boot. Deal! \n \nI loved that 101 and shot it accordingly. We were lethal on doves, quail and pheasants. \n \nI don't have it anymore, and I have no recollection of parting with it. It comes back to me in fond memories. \n \nIn 2005, I spied an old Winchester Super X1 12-gauge unassembled in Winchester's old red, white and blue box at the old Fort Thompson store in Rose City. The price was $325, which was phenomenal. It had a 30-inch, full choke barrel, so I went online and bought additional Skeet, Modified and Improved Cylinder barrels. \n \nThat X1 was a natural fit for me, and I shot it like I was born to it. Somehow I got it in my mind that I had no practical use for a 12-gauge that chambered only 2¾-inch shells, and I let it and its barrels go. \n \nThe same goes for the Remington Model 1100 Classic 16-gauge that I got for a bargain in 2006. I never shot a gun better than that one, but I resented the fact Remington compromised by putting an under-bored 12-gauge barrel on a 12-gauge frame, which made it too heavy for a 16-gauge. Away it went, to my everlasting regret. \n \nThe one I miss more than anything is a Remington 870 Express Youth Model 20-gauge that I bought in 2003 for my son, Daniel. It had a short little stock and a 22-inch barrel, and it came with an additional rifled slug barrel. \n \nDan used it for all of his hunting. He was a wicked wingshot with it, and I still daydream about his performance during our second-to-last duck hunt together at Hampton Reservoir when he was 16. \n \nWhen Dan joined the Marines, I figured he wouldn't want it anymore, what with all the big-league weaponry he got to play with in the Corps, so I sold it to someone who wanted it for his own young son. \n \nDan died in May, and I regret parting with his one prized possession. \n \nMy daughters want to learn to shoot, and if I had that one back, I would never let it go again. \n \nSports on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[],"title":"Lamenting guns that got away over the years","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204166798","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:35Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It started Friday and ends tonight, when the largest buck killed in Arkansas this season is recognized. While the big buck show is the central attraction, the vendors encompass a show unto itself. \n \nAmong the firearm crowd is Lucas Henry, an Australian native representing Osprey Global, a supplier of tactical firearm accessories. \n \n\"We cater to anyone who wants to be more accurate -- especially with their rifles -- with scopes,\" Henry said. \"We're famous for our 3-to-9 compact scope. It has 10-inch eye relief. You can use it like a reflex sight, but still have it up to 9-power so you can get out to 550 yards.\" \n \nWhile Osprey products appeal to the tactical rifle crowd, Henry said hunters buy them for other firearms as well. \n \n\"We're known for our tactical lights and battle grips, but people have been putting them on their shotguns,\" Henry said. \"Our 3-to-9 has got such quick target acquisition, people have been putting it on their .30-06 rifles in lieu of traditional 4-to-16 hunting scopes.\" \n \nAccording to Henry, election years are huge for the firearms industry, regardless of who wins, Henry said. \n \n\"It's true. We sold out of night vision when the recent election was coming through,\" Henry said. \"When [Barack] Obama first got elected, the ammo guys and the hardware guys couldn't keep up with the AR [AR-15] market. \n \n\"We get a lot more people who are still [shotgun users], but they get ARs because that's the first thing they think will be taken away. At least, that's my thought.\" \n \nThe tactical market continues to soar, and accessories are a major component, Henry said. \n \n\"Buying an AR is like Legos for adults,\" Henry said. \"They buy it, then they get accessories for it. It's the easiest one to get into because it's the most toy-friendly.\" \n \nThey're also like Lay's potato chips. Shooters aren't satisfied with just one AR-15. \n \n\"They trick them out if they might want to do some hog hunting, or they might want it for self-defense,\" Henry said. \"They might be taking their first steps into any kind of rifle at all. It's a very versatile weapon.\" \n \nHunting land \n \nRecreational property is a growing segment of the real estate market, and that's the crowd that Michael Clayton is here to meet as a representative of Whitetail Properties Real Estate. \n \n\"The market, especially for recreational properties, is really improving,\" Clayton said. \"People are confident, much more so than they have been. Not just buyers, but sellers as well.\" \n \nClayton, a registered forester from Camden, said that rebounding timber markets are improving land values. \n \nSpecifically, Clayton said he is attending the Big Buck Classic to meet people or groups of people that are looking for properties ranging from 40-80 acres for individuals to 500-800 acres for groups. \n \n\"We cater to recreational hunting properties and timber properties,\" Clayton said. \"Surprisingly, there's a growing market for people looking for a place to get away for the weekend or a week. Rather than going to a lodge, they want to buy their own 40 or 80 acres.\" \n \nChronic wasting disease has not had an adverse effect on Arkansas hunting properties, Clayton said. \n \n\"It really hasn't because it's a very localized disease,\" Clayton said. \"Thanks to things like the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette , we have an outlet to get that information out, so people are aware of it.\" \n \nPeople in Arkansas are interested in buying properties where they can hunt deer and waterfowl, Clayton said, but they should treat rural property as an income-producing investment. \n \n\"Deer and ducks, that's our two bigs,\" Clayton said. \"As a forester, I tell people there's no point in having land you can't make money on. It should have an annual rowcrop or a long-term row crop like timber. Manage it as such where you can enjoy it but also make money on it.\" \n \nGrowing bucks \n \nWhen purchasing hunting property, it's important to know how to manage it effectively for deer and other wildlife. That's why the University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture Research and Extension has a booth at the Big Buck Classic. \n \nBryce Baldridge, an extension agent for Lawrence County, said he has information about how to tell the age of whitetailed deer that are killed, information about different plants for food plots, information about when to plant for best results and kits for soil samples. He also has information about how to control feral hogs. \n \nGetting a soil sample is the most important step in cultivating effective food plots, Baldridge said. Also, it is necessary to get multiple samples from different parts of a field. \n \n\"You might have clay in one spot, and you might have a lower spot with sand in it, so you'll treat those differently,\" Baldridge said. \"Put your samples in a box, bring it to our office, and we'll send it off for you. It's free.\" \n \nFor best results, Jaret Rushing, an extension agent for Calhoun County, said landowners should keep a rotation of crops that thrive in different seasons. \n \n\"The best thing to do is to get a mix of rape, chicory, sunflowers, soybeans and things like that,\" Rushing said. \"You can grow that kind of stuff anywhere in Arkansas as long as your soil is not completely compacted or unless it's just the poorest soil out there.\" \n \nWhat about summer, when it seldom rains? \n \n\"In July, deer have reached their peak antler production, so all they are doing in July through August is finishing their antlers off,\" Rushing said. \"Spring to August is when you really need to feed.\" \n \nAugust is when fall plots need to be started. \n \nRushing said hunters should be tilling and testing their soil for spring forage at this time. If hunting is done in south Arkansas, sweetening the soil with lime is more important than fertilizing. \n \n\"If you're not going to lime, fertilizing is almost pointless,\" Rushing said. \n \nAbout two tons per acre are needed, but since most food plots are about one-tenth of an acre or thereabouts, only 200 to 400 pounds are needed. \n \nWhen daytime temperatures hover around 65 degrees, rye grass should be intensively encouraged. \n \n\"For turkey populations and spring populations of deer, rye grass is still very palatable, and it's still very nutritional to deer and turkey,\" Rushing said. \"You can't go wrong with rye grass.\" \n \nVendors are scratching turkey calls all over the building. Spring turkey season will be here soon, so it's time to make the rounds. \n \nSports on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[],"title":"'Classic' conversations","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/28/resized_250499-sunoutlucashenrymugbw_22-22506_t635.jpg?673328f4bb9263a287d110865e74e7950bdf1585"],"sequenceId":"695204166973","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:03Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/28/resized_250499-sunoutdeer55pbw_11-22506.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It's urgent Democrats stop squabbling and recognize seven basic truths: \n  \nThe Party is on life support. Democrats are in the minority in both the House and Senate, with no end in sight. Since the start of the Obama Administration they've lost 1,034 state and federal seats. They hold only governorships, and face 32 state legislatures fully under GOP control. No one speaks for the party as a whole. The Party's top leaders are aging, and the back bench is thin. \n   \nThe future is bleak unless the Party radically reforms itself. If Republicans do well in the 2018 midterms, they'll control Congress and the Supreme Court for years. If they continue to hold most statehouses, they could entrench themselves for a generation. \n   \nWe are now in a populist era. The strongest and most powerful force in American politics is a rejection of the status quo, a repudiation of politics as usual, and a deep and profound distrust of elites, including the current power structure of America. \n   \nThat force propelled Donald Trump into the White House. He represents the authoritarian side of populism. Bernie Sanders's primary campaign represented the progressive side. \n   \nThe question hovering over America's future is which form of populism will ultimately prevail. At some point, hopefully, Trump voters will discover they've been hoodwinked. Even in its purest form, authoritarian populism doesn't work because it destroys democracy. Democrats must offer the alternative. \n   \nThe economy is not working for most Americans. The economic data show lower unemployment and higher wages than eight years ago, but the typical family is still poorer today than it was in 2000, adjusted for inflation; median weekly earnings are no higher than in 2000; a large number of working-age people--mostly men--have dropped out of the labor force altogether; and job insecurity is endemic. \n   \nInequality is wider and its consequences more savage in America than in any other advanced nation. \n  \nThe Party's moneyed establishment--big donors, major lobbyists, retired members of Congress who have become bundlers and lobbyists--are part of the problem. Even though many consider themselves \"liberal\" and don't recoil from an active government, their preferred remedies spare corporations and the wealthiest from making any sacrifices. \n \nThe moneyed interests in the Party allowed the deregulation of Wall Street and then encouraged its bailout. They're barely concerned about the growth of tax havens, inside trading, increasing market power in major industries (pharmaceuticals, telecom, airlines, private health insurers, food processors, finance, even high tech), and widening inequality. \n \nMeanwhile, they've allowed labor unions to shrink to near irrelevance. Unionized workers used to be the ground troops of the Democratic Party. In the 1950s, more than a third of all private-sector workers were unionized; today, fewer than 7 percent are. \n \nIt's not enough for Democrats to be \"against Trump,\" and defend the status quo. Democrats have to fight like hell against regressive policies Trump wants to put in place, but Democrats also need to fight for a bold vision of what the nation must achieve--like expanding Social Security, and financing the expansion by raising the cap on income subject to Social Security taxes; Medicare for all; and world-class free public education for all. \n \nAnd Democrats must diligently seek to establish countervailing power--stronger trade unions, community banks, more incentives for employee ownership and small businesses, and electoral reforms that get big money out of politics and expand the right to vote. \n \nThe life of the Party--its enthusiasm, passion, youth, principles, and ideals--was elicited by Bernie Sanders' campaign. This isn't to denigrate what Hillary Clinton accomplished; she did after all win the popular vote in the presidential election by almost 3 million people. It's only to recognize what all of us witnessed: the huge outpouring of excitement that Bernie's campaign inspired, especially from the young. This is the future of the Democratic Party. \n \nThe Party must change from being a giant fundraising machine to a movement. It needs to unite the poor, working class, and middle class, black and white--who haven't had a raise in 30 years, and who feel angry, powerless, and disenfranchised. \n \nIf the Party doesn't understand these seven truths and fails to do what's needed, a third party will emerge to fill the void. \n \nThird parties usually fail because they tend to draw votes away from the dominant party closest to them, ideologically. But if the Democratic Party creates a large enough void, a third party won't draw away votes. It will pull people into politics. \n \nAnd drawing more people into politics is the only hope going forward. \n \nRobert B.

The exhibit exists thanks in large part to a grant from the National Park Service to encourage spreading the story of Rohwer and Jerome. \n \nThe efforts of people like actor George Takei, who lived at Rohwer and the Tule Lake facility in California as a child, have drawn more attention to the story of Japanese Americans' forced relocations, a story that has been \n \nlargely unheard for many years. \n \n\"It's only been in the past couple of decades that this story has gained momentum,\" Sanders says. \"For a while, it was swept under the rug. People didn't talk about it.\" \n \nThe 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor fanned strong anti-Japanese sentiments and fears of further Japanese attacks on the United States. In response, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, ordering the deportation and internment of thousands of people of Japanese descent, most of whom were American citizens and most of whom lived in California, Oregon and Washington state. \n \nMany were gathered in places like the Santa Anita racetrack, where horse stables were converted into \"apartments,\" before the people were loaded on trains and sent to camps. They worked, went to school, took classes, took part in camp government, had clubs and social events, but they were also surrounded by barbed wire and guards and forced away from their homes and livelihoods. \n \n... \n \nThe Butler Center has a large collection of artifacts, particularly from Rohwer, that includes art, furniture, camp school yearbooks, newsletters, posters, circulars, even mundane things such as art supply lists. \n \nMuch of that is due to the foresight and dedication of Mabel \"Jamie\" Jamison Vogel, the art teacher at Rohwer, who saved everything she could think of. When she died, she left her collection to Rosalie Santine Gould, the mayor of McGehee, who eventually donated everything to the Butler Center. \n \nIt was a perfect fit, Butler Center Director David Stricklin says. There are five galleries for displaying art, but also a research room that's open to the general public. \n \n\"You could go up there right now and sit down and read. We're unusual in that respect.\" \n \nAs word has gotten around about the collection, more and more people have donated pieces because, as Stricklin explains, they realize that having such an extensive collection in one place \"attracts people to come learn about it and experience it.\" \n \nOne person who donated works to the collection is Frank Sata (named for President Franklin Roosevelt), whose father, J.T. Sata, was an accomplished and established artist before his incarceration at Jerome. The new exhibit features a few of his paintings of the Jerome camp and one of his sketchbooks. They were some of the last pieces Sata ever did. \n \n\"As a result of the whole experience, he stopped creating art,\" Stricklin says. \"It was so jarring for him he couldn't do it anymore.\" \n \nThe exhibit is organized thematically. Along one wall, there's a timeline that covers the story of the Japanese in America from the 19th century to the 21st, with a heavy emphasis on WWII. The historical data is interspersed with photos and artwork and excerpts from autobiographies by Rohwer high school students who were asked to write about their experiences so far. \n \nThe artwork is divided into sections. There's a section on Vogel, with her portrait and photos of her students posing by the mural they painted on the walls of the camp gym, and displays on Rohwer and Jerome. \n \nThe wall on community focuses on the various activities and interests people had, like a series of fashion sketches. \n \n\"A lot of what the people in the camps tried to make life as normal as possible,\" Stricklin says. \"So some of the young women, especially, they would design dresses because that's what they had been interested in.\" \n \nThey also kept up with more traditional Japanese art like kobu (a process of boiling, removing bark from and polishing cypress knees) and there are a few examples on display. \n \n\"Part of it goes back to this Japanese aesthetic of loving natural forms, simple things and things that are imperfect,\" Sanders says. \n \nNearby, the identity wall has sketches and paintings that represent the cultural duality these people felt -- the pull between their dedication to and love for America and the pride and strength of their Japanese heritage. \n \n\"For a lot of them, it was a real struggle with their identity,\" Sanders says. \"You can be 100 percent American and have a different heritage. We know that now, but back then that was a different story.\" \n \nThat duality also comes into stark relief in the wall of patriotic posters, all painted in the camp and all looking very much like posters that could be found all over the country. Calls to \"Keep Them Flying\" or to buy war bonds. Despite the fact that they were called \"resident non-aliens\" instead of \"citizens\" and that they had been taken from their homes, many of them were still very patriotic. \n \nSanders says, \"It's no different in these camps, even though they were rounded up by the very government they're trying to support, they still want to show they're loyal Americans so they were going to do their part for the war effort.\" \n \nAbout 800 Rohwer camp inmates ended up serving in the 442nd combat team in Europe, which may have been the most highly decorated military unit in the war. \n \n\"Their attitude was, I think, the faster the war ends, the faster we can go back to California,\" Stricklin says. \n \nThe residents had access to ample amounts of wood, since Japanese American labor was used to clear the swamps for farmland. \n \nMuch of that wood was used to make furniture. The government provided inmates with a pot-bellied stove, a cot and a mattress. To make their little barrack apartments less stark, residents made their own furniture, built front porches, added gardens and gazebos. The exhibit includes a chair, table and screen made from pieces of scrap wood. \n \nWhile Sata's paintings and some other pieces are obviously by skilled, highly trained artists, Sanders says, \"Most of the work that we have here is by people who had never done art before.\" \n \nArt classes were very popular at the camps with adults and children and while they did have some art supplies to work with and they could order fabric to make clothes, they also created art out of whatever they could find -- like making carefully sewn necklaces out of metal buttons. \n \n\"The ingenuity in this whole collection -- the whole experience is just incredible,\" Sanders says. \"It's a testament to how humans can endure. They usually turn to art for endurance. It gives them some sort of control, I think, over their surroundings when they have little control otherwise.\" \n \n... \n \nThis particular exhibit will continue at the Butler Center through June 24, but there will be three more. In the fall, there will be an exhibit of photographs by Paul Faris, who was invited to the camp to photograph the residents. \n \nPart three, in winter/spring 2018, will focus on the experiences of the camp high school students, giving more details from the students' autobiographies, artworks and yearbooks. \n \nThe final part, in later 2018, will be on camp portraits. \n \nThe current exhibit will stay in a state of flux. \n \n\"Things are going to change,\" says co-curator Colin Thompson. \"What you see here is just the beginning.\" \n \nThey plan to continue to add more pieces of artwork from the permanent collection, so Thompson promises there will be different things to see as weeks go by. \n \nThe national attention drawn to the story of Japanese Americans in WWII has increased over the years, and so has interest in the Butler Center's collection. \n \nTakei has come to visit and explore the art and documents. While they have not interviewed him, they have started collecting interviews with other former inmates, their families and the relatives of people who worked at the camps. And they have hopes for starting new research projects based on the documents and works in the collection. \n \nBut it's still a subject many people don't know about. Even if they do know about the internment camps in general, there are still many who don't realize there were two in Arkansas. That's what the exhibit hopes to correct: to let people know what happened in southeast Arkansas and to link past and present. \n \n\"Part of what I've tried to do here was try to relate it to people today,\" Sanders says. \"I try to drive it home that it's really up to us to reshape society so something like this doesn't happen again.\" \n \nThat connection between past and present comes through in the first-person accounts of the students, or in a young woman's sketches designing her dream formal gown -- one that looks much like a dress from Gone With the Wind . It's a world away, but also so very normal. \n \n\"I want them to know that just because it's history doesn't mean it can't happen again,\" Sanders says. \"History is a living, breathing thing. It's not just over. It's something we make happen every day.\" \n \nThompson agrees. \n \n\"It's a tremendous story. A very moving story. When you meet people who were in the camps and you see, this isn't just a random fact. These were real people that were in these camps in Arkansas. I think it's something people should know about.\" \n \nStyle on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Art from broken hearts","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-scc-sized-butler-center-07_82-22506_t635.JPG?673328f4bb9263a287d110865e74e7950bdf1585","http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-scc-sized-butler-center-01_93-22506_t635.JPG?673328f4bb9263a287d110865e74e7950bdf1585","http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/28/0129jeromerohwer_t635.png?673328f4bb9263a287d110865e74e7950bdf1585"],"sequenceId":"695204168125","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:10:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/28/Butler_center_art.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

As it stands, At its most basic level, the so-called \"Canada-plus\" Brexit would likely include many of the characteristics of CETA \u2014 Canada and the EU\u2019s trade agreement \u2014 such as the removal of the majority of tariffs on goods, excluding certain parts of the UK\u2019s services sector and some food items like eggs and chicken.\n\nIt would provide extensive access to the single market, but not include the immigration demands and budget contributions required of non-EU members in the European Economic Area like Switzerland and Norway.\n\nWhen Prime Minister Theresa May delivered her key Brexit speech earlier in January, she effectively ruled out EEA membership, That is why the Centre for European Politics sees a deal similar to Ukraine\u2019s as a viable option for the UK.\n\nHere is the key extract from the report (emphasis ours):\n\n\"A model for this special type of partnership could be provided by the Association and Free Trade Agreement which the EU has concluded with the Ukraine. This has been in effect since 1 January 2016, although some of it only provisionally because ratification by the Netherlands is still outstanding.\n\n\"Firstly, the \"Ukraine Model\" corresponds to the British objectives in that it contains substantial market access but does not require the application of EU law or compliance with the case law of the ECJ, nor does it provide for free movement but it does allow free trade agreements with third countries. Thus the United Kingdom\u2019s four key requirements are met.\" \n\nHere is the CEP\u2019s table, illustrating the benefits of a Ukraine-style deal: The think-tank does acknowledge that issues could arise with a Ukraine-style deal for the UK, particularly when it comes to the financial services sector \u2014 which has been one of the most contentious issues since the Brexit vote.\n\nBanks currently have the right to \"passport\" their financial licences in one EU market to another, preventing them having to go through the costly and complicated process of being regulated in each market where they operate, but that passport could be lost after the Brexit process has been completed, causing chaos for Britain\u2019s financial services industry.\n\nRoughly 13,500 companies use financial passporting in relation to the UK with all types of businesses from newspapers to removals companies, all the way to a body that represents acupuncturists holding passports.\n\n\"The agreement with the Ukraine is unlikely to satisfy the United Kingdom as regards the scope of trade liberalisation because it contains numerous restrictions on market access particularly for cross-border services. The United Kingdom will probably require better access to the EU internal market, primarily in the interests of the British finance industry,\" the report notes.\n\nThat\u2019s where the \"Plus\" comes in, with the UK creating a bespoke deal that includes many of the features of the Ukrainian agreement, but also includes concessions to the banking and finance sectors.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Will Martin"},"topics":[{"name":"Eastern Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Ukraine news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"European Union news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"UK business news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Britain could strike a 'Ukraine Plus' style Brexit deal","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Business Insider Australia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"360179039","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"129"},"name":"Business Insider Australia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.businessinsider.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cep.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/cep.eu/Studien/cepAdhoc_Brexit/cepAdhoc_Ukraine_Plus_as_a_model_for_Brexit.pdf","http://www.businessinsider.com.au/theresa-may-britain-european-union-eu-hard-brexit-europe-2017-1","https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderAustralia","https://twitter.com/BIAUS","http://www.linkedin.com/company/business-insider-au","https://www.instagram.com/businessinsiderau/","http://feeds.businessinsider.com.au/~/t/0/0/businessinsideraustraliaau/~www.businessinsider.com.au/britain-ukraine-plus-brexit-deal-2017-1","http://feeds.businessinsider.com.au/_/2/264463524/businessinsideraustraliaau","http://feeds.businessinsider.com.au/_/30/264463524/businessinsideraustraliaau","http://feeds.businessinsider.com.au/_/1/264463524/businessinsideraustraliaau","http://feeds.businessinsider.com.au/_/24/264463524/businessinsideraustraliaau"],"sequenceId":"695204168438","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T19:19:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://feeds.businessinsider.com.au/-/264463522/0/businessinsideraustraliaau.jpg"},{"url":"http://static.businessinsider.com/image/588da598dd08953c248b4a96-640/image.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Rodgers shot a 67 as he goes for his first PGA Tour victory. \n \n\"Exactly where I want to be, in the last group here,\" Snedeker said. \"This is obviously a tough golf course. There's a lot of guys within a couple shots of the lead, so it doesn't really mean a whole lot. But this place, for whatever reason, seems to bring out my best and I'm excited about the challenge.\" \n \nSnedeker and Rodgers were at 9-under 207, and Snedeker has been around long to know that a share of the 54-hole lead means nothing. \n \nFifteen players were within three shots of the lead. \n \nThe last time Snedeker had a share of the 54-hole lead at Torrey Pines was in 2007, his rookie year. \n \n\"Tiger won,\" he said with a laugh as he walked out the door. \n \nTiger Woods was long gone after missing the cut, along with Dustin Johnson, Jason Day and Rickie Fowler. Phil Mickelson is still very much in the picture after a 68 left him four shots behind in his bid to win at Torrey Pines for the fourth time, but first since 2001. \n \nRodgers is the latest player from the high school class of 2011 with a chance to shine, an athletic and powerful player who has been patiently waiting his turn. He picked up a little extra motivation from watching one of his best friends, former roommate Justin Thomas, sweep the Hawaii swing. \n \nBefore Thomas, it was Jordan Spieth who picking up big trophies at an alarming rate. \n \nAlso in range of a victory today are two others from that high school graduating class -- C.T. Pan of Taiwan, who played at Washington, birdied three of his last five holes for a 69 and was one shot behind; and Ollie Schniederjans struggled on the back nine but still managed a 71 to finish two shots back. \n \nAlso in the mix was Pat Perez, who grew up at Torrey Pines and whose father, Mike, is the starter on the first tee. Perez shot a 67 and goes into the final round just two shots behind. \n \nJustin Rose, who started the third round with a one-shot lead, fell behind on the second hole and never caught up. He shot 73 and was in the large group at 7-under 209. \n \nBryce Molder (Conway) shot an even-par 72 and is at even 216. \n \nLPGA TOUR \n \nLewis ties Thompson \n \nPARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas -- Former Arkansas Razorback Stacy Lewis had two back-nine eagles Saturday in the LPGA Tour's season-opening Pure Silk Bahamas Classic to put herself in position again to end a long winless streak. \n \nLewis shot a 10-under 63 at Ocean Club to match Lexi Thompson atop the leaderboard at 23-under 196, one off the tour 54-hole record for relation to par set by Annika Sorenstam in the 2003 Mizuno Classic. \n \n\"That was probably the best round I think I've ever shot on tour in relation to par, so just a cool day,\" Lewis said. \"I didn't exactly hit it perfect, got away with a few shots, but just took advantage of it. I didn't even know what I shot there at the end of the day.\" \n \nLewis was second in the event in 2014 and tied for second last year, one of her 11 runner-up finishes since her last victory in June 2014. She has 11 tour victories, including two majors. \n \nLewis holed out from the fairway for eagle on the par-5 11th, birdied the next two, and dropped a stroke on the par-4 14th. She birdied the par-3 17th and made a 12-foot eagle putt on the par-5 18th. She had four birdies on the front nine. \n \n\"I knew I needed to be aggressive out there today, and it wasn't pretty at times, wasn't perfect, but the scorecard turned out great,\" Lewis said. \"You've just got to take advantage. When those miss-hits work out good, you take advantage of it, and that's what I did today.\" \n \nThompson followed her tournament-record 61 on Friday with a 66.

This rise in awareness has resulted in a strong response from eager exhibitors for the World Food \u2013 one of eight specialist sectors in the newly evolved format of Gulfood 2017, which is taking place from 26 February to 2 March 2017 at the Dubai World Trade Centre (DWTC). \n \nOne trend seen across the globe is product knowledge and value, as consumers become more price conscious and increasingly mistrust brands, especially those from the largest global food manufacturers. \n \nThere is also a shift towards more \"authentic\", niche and natural products, with people seeking brands that they see as upholding key values. In addition, a growing number of consumers trust organic products to be healthier, more natural and greener but also favour smaller niche food manufacturers over large food multinationals. \n \nThe Asia-Pacific and Middle East and Africa regions are the main global growth drivers of packaged food globally. \n \nNations from East to West, North to South have signed up to showcase country-specific products, services and business opportunities at the 22nd edition of the world's largest food and hospitality show, which will feature 120 national pavilions \n \n\"Transparency on sourcing is taking centre stage in the food-value chain and World Food recognises demand for nations to build brand-trust that is now paramount to consumers,\" said Trixie LohMirmand, Senior Vice President, Exhibitions & Events Management, DWTC. \n \n\"The new sectorised format of the show will create better access for visitors to reach their target products and with World Food housed in its own dedicated sector, exhibitors will be able to offer greater insight into origin and source of their produce.\" \n \nSouth America is out in force at Gulfood 2017 with Minerva Foods, one of the continent's biggest players in the production and sale of fresh beef and its bi-products. With the Middle East and Africa so important to the company, representing 35 per cent of the company's international sales in the last twelve months ended in September 2016, the firm is now developing new, market-specific products, says Minerva Chief Commercial Operator, Iain Mars. \n \n\"We have a plan with SALIC (Saudi Agricultural and Livestock Investment Company) to address the food security issue in this region through a new distribution system focused on high-quality food supply,\" Mars said. \n \n\"The Middle East region faces a lot of challenges, including the non-favourable climate and limited availability of water, as well as the political insecurity in some countries. Despite the influence of urbanisation, westernisation, population growth and better purchasing power contributing to an increase in regional meat consumption, the elevated cost of production has historically limited investments in meat production and created a higher dependency on imports. \n \n\"All these factors increase the potential for South America to become the main supplier for the Middle East, exporting high-quality products with efficiency and at competitive prices. \n \n\"The change in format can only help as the dedicated World Food sector will allow us to better showcase what we have to offer.\" \n \nMars is tipping Halal and organic foods to be the Middle East's premier growth sectors, adding: \"Organic and grass-fed demand should increase following a shift in global behaviour towards lean and natural products.\" \n \nBrazilian interests at Gulfood will be boosted by the presence of the Arab Brazilian Chamber of Commerce, with spokesperson Michel Alaby citing the Arab world as the second major importer of Brazilian foodstuff after China ­- regional sales hit $8.68 billion in 2015. \n \nAlaby said: \"Among the most important Brazilian foodstuff products exported to the Arab countries are meat, sugar, cereals, oil seeds, coffee, milk and fruits. Brazilian companies are developing their knowledge of the Arab countries and features such as the Halal certificates for, but not limited to, meat and its bi-products.\" \n \nIreland, meanwhile, hopes a strong reputation in the provenance of its beef and poultry will boost regional sales, during Gulfood 2017.  A highlight of the Bord Bia Ireland pavilion will be the showcasing of the Golden Irish eggs brand, with the Emerald Isle's food board eager to leverage the country's product pedigree. \n \nGolden Irish spokesman Brian Eivers, said: \"We're focused on offering customers a range of high-quality, 100 per cent Republic of Ireland BRC Grade A eggs. With a strong customer based across both retail and foodservice industries, we're well placed to service the needs of a growing market. \n \nThe brand, operating in the GCC since 2014, were the first to introduce Irish eggs to the market and are now moving into the supply of boiled and liquid egg to enhance their stronghold. The World Food sector at Gulfood 2017 will also see the launch of a new, bilingual Golden Irish Organic 10 Pack designed especially for the Middle East. \n \n\"We've seen significant growth in our organic offering and created this product to offer customers greater options,\" said Eivers, 'adding to our range of beautiful colour coded retail packs' \n \nIreland is eager to showcase its reputation for providing great quality food at the Bord Bia Ireland pavilion, this will be championed by dry-aged grass-fed beef producer John Stone Beef. \n \nAllan Morris, its Managing Director, said Ireland's standard, yet stand-out beef rearing processes gives it the edge with increasingly quality conscious consumers: \"Our beef is sourced from suckler farmers, which means the calves stay with their mothers to suckle until they are independent and can forage for themselves,\" Morris said. \"This system is quite unique but is the normal standard in Ireland, ensuring sustainability and grassland management is achieved. \n \n\"All Middle East countries are growing in terms of their desire for safe, sustainable and natural foods for their consumers. We are keen to show in the World Food segment why Ireland is well positioned to help them achieve this within their marketplaces.\" \n \nAt the show, John Stone will roll out a host of new products all falling in line with its strict Halal protocols. Morris added: \"We are proud to say that we are the first meat company in Europe that has been granted the National Halal Mark. This mark is an assurance of quality and verification that the highest Halal standards have been achieved.\" \n \nThe dairy sector, meanwhile, is a key focus for Belgium's Flanders' Agricultural Marketing Board, which will have six dairies on show, under its White Gold from Europe banner. \n \nLatvia, making its fourth Gulfood foray, is fielding its largest national delegation to date, with 20 companies under the banner of the country's Ministry of Agriculture \u2013 up from seven producers three years ago. And the Latvians have high hopes of new business. \n \n\"Our aim is to cover all countries in the Middle East region and to introduce our high-quality and healthy products,\" explained ministry of agriculture spokesperson Daina Saktina. \"A high share of all Latvian products can be evaluated as eco and healthy-life products. We know that clients and customers from the region have high demands for food quality and we can satisfy these. We don't have many mass production companies with average products. We have smaller, diverse companies which prioritise quality, uniqueness and healthy life products.\" \n \nWorld Food is one of eight dedicated segments now housed within Gulfood to ensure buyers can more easily and effectively navigate the giant show. The other features are: beverages; dairy; fats & oils; health, wellness & free-from; pulses, grains & cereals; meat & poultry and Power Brands. \n \nGulfood 2017 is a trade event open strictly to business and trade visitors. The show is open 11am-7pm from February 26 to March 1 2017 and 11am-5pm on March 2 2017.

Kennedy airport in New York City, despite having previously been granted asylum and holding valid visas. Both men were released Saturday. \n \n\"There  is imminent danger that, absent the stay of removal, there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject to the January 27, 2017, Executive Order,\" US District Judge Ann Donnelly  said in her ruling . \n \nThe court order will \"not allow the government to remove anybody who has come and is caught up in the order nationwide. They cannot remove anybody,\" Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said in a video posted by the organization. \"The key tonight was to make sure no one was put back on a plane.\" \n \nGelernt also said the court ordered the government to give the ACLU a list of names of the people who are being detained, and that \"at a minimum\" they will not be returned. \n \nAt the  US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ,  Judge Leonie Brinkema  ordered that  \u201call legal permanent residents being detained at Dulles International Airport\u201d be permitted to recieve access to lawyers, BuzzFeed's Chris Geidner reported .  Brinkema also issued an order blocking for seven days the removal of any permanent residents being detained at Dulles International Airport, the Washington Post reported . \n \nIn Washington,  US District Judge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay on the order to deport two unnamed individuals. \n \nIn Massachusetts, US District Judge Allison Burroughs and d Magistrate Judge  Judith G. Dein ruled early Sunday morning for a temporary seven-day stay on the removal, detainment, or additional screenings of l awful permanent US residents  under the authority of Trump's executive order. The judges also expanded the stay to pertain to citizens, visa-holders, approved refugees, and individuals from all nations named in the executive order  according to freelance reporter Joshua Eaton , who was at the courthouse. \n \nThe ACLU of Massachusetts, along with other immigration lawyers, filed the suit in federal court on behalf of two detained Iranian professors . Mazdak Pourabdollah Tootkaboni and Arghavan Louhghalam, two associate professors at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth who are both Iranian nationals and lawful permanent US residents were being detained at Logan Airport in Boston as of Saturday evening.  \n \nIn a statement , ACLU executive director Anthony Romero slammed Trump for suffering \"his first loss in court\" in his first week in office. \n \n\"Clearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country. Our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders,\" Romero said. \n [embedded content]  \nTrump's order, signed Friday afternoon, had prompted widespread chaos at airports across the country as refugees and travelers were detained after arriving and denied entry. \n \nThe ACLU lawyers argued the order was \"unconstitutional\" and a \"violation of international law.\" \n \nDemonstrators outside the courthouse erupted in cheers as news of the stay spread.   \n \n\"I hope Trump enjoys losing.

Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), Trump's nominee for CIA director, from swift confirmation on Jan. 20; the full Senate confirmed him Monday. \n \nThe spat capped an acrimonious beginning to the new Congress and set a potentially hostile tone of partisanship as Republicans' took control of Washington, signaling potentially lengthy fights to come. \n \nSeveral senators told RealClearPolitics the Cabinet disagreement did not necessarily indicate that bipartisanship would be impossible in a closely divided Senate. But lawmakers in both parties said it is incumbent on the other side to cede ground in order to find a semblance of consensus. \n \nThe entire confirmation process has irked Democrats, who have complained about missing ethics paperwork and limited questioning of nominees during hearings. Republicans in turn have accused the minority party of slow-walking the process to prevent Trump from putting his team in place at the start of his administration. \n \nThe disagreement led to just two nominees being confirmed on Jan. 20, five fewer than on President Obama's 2009 Inauguration Day: Gen. James Mattis as defense secretary and Gen. John Kelly to \n \nlead the Department of Homeland Security, both of whom received overwhelming bipartisan support. \n \nThe limited confirmation votes sent signals that, with major legislative battles looming and a Supreme Court nomination likely in the coming weeks, the Senate could soon become mired in partisan bickering and slow-moving deliberation. \n \nSen. John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the upper chamber, was one of three party members who suggested opponents were throwing a temper tantrum over Trump's Cabinet picks. \n \n\"I think we need to stop bad habits on the part of the Democrats,\" Cornyn said shortly before the inauguration. \"Obviously they lost the election, they're not happy about it. I don't expect them to be happy about it, but I also don't expect them to engage in bad behavior that really doesn't serve any other purpose other than maybe make them feel better in their loss.\" \n \nDemocrats were not pleased with the criticism. Cornyn's counterpart, Democratic Whip Dick Durbin, said on the Senate floor the suggestion they were slowing down Cabinet confirmations \"negates and ignores the reality before us.\" Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called it \"disingenuous.\" \n \n\"I'm an easy-going guy. That criticism just has no legs at all,\" Cardin told reporters. \"It is unfair what they're saying. You want to go back and talk about a Supreme Court nominee that sat there for a year? You want to go talk about judges? We want to move these nominees as quickly as we possibly can.\" \n \nDemocrat Chris Coons said his party's approach to these appointments \"sets the theme\" for the Senate in the next four years. \n \n\"In those cases where the president-elect has nominated someone capable of leading an agency, Democrats are working with them and supporting them,\" Coons said shortly before Trump's inauguration. \"And in those cases--and sadly there are many--where he has nominated people who are patently unqualified, have conflicts of interest or are determined to undermine or destroy the agencies they've been nominated to run, they'll face vigorous opposition.\" \n \nSome Republicans blistered at Democrats' tactics, particularly the delay until Monday of Pompeo's nomination for CIA director. Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he'd had an agreement with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that Pompeo, who was sworn in Monday by Vice President Mike Pence, would receive a vote on inauguration day after Burr rescheduled his hearing by a day to accommodate Democrats' preference. A senior Democratic aide denied such an agreement had existed. \n \n\"It doesn't speak well that Chuck Schumer is breaking his word in the first month of the Congress,\" Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) told RCP. \n \nOthers were more measured in their reactions. North Dakota Republican John Hoeven said it was clear Democrats were trying to slow the process, but that the Republican majority would simply have to keep \"grinding the Senate, keep working.\" \n \n\"I think they're sending the signal that they're going to contest the things we try to do,\" Hoeven told RCP. \"But I hope out of that debate we can convince members of the other caucus that they need to join us in a bipartisan way on some solutions.\" \n \nThere are signs, at least at the individual level, of bipartisanship. Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia--a state Trump won by 40 percentage points--has shown a willingness to vote for some of Trump's controversial Cabinet appointments. And on issues of trade and infrastructure, he is hopeful for consensus. \n \n\"I'm trying ... so hard,\" Manchin said when asked by a reporter what the prospects were for bipartisanship. \"Jesus Christ, I'm trying. I'm doing everything I can.\" \n \nManchin is considered the likeliest Democrat to cross party lines on key issues, and serves in Schumer's leadership as an envoy to Republicans and the administration. But even some of his more liberal colleagues appeared interested in better relations. Sen. Chris Murphy said he didn't appreciate Republicans' handling of the hearing process, but wasn't pessimistic about the prospects of bipartisanship going forward. He said he thought Schumer and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's relationship would likely bring deals that benefit both sides. \n \n\"We can both do better going forward,\" Murphy said. \"Republicans can be fairer to us and we can probably be fairer to them.\" Republicans departed Wednesday for a retreat in Philadelphia. \n \nBeyond the Cabinet, however, the Senate will have to confirm approximately 1,200 other administration appointees, consider a Supreme Court nomination, begin the arduous process of repealing and replacing the Affordable Cart Act and start work on various legislative priorities. Because the Senate moves slowly and time for floor debate is a precious commodity, Sen. Ben Sasse, a conservative Nebraska Republican who often opposed Trump during the campaign, said Schumer and Democrats could essentially hold the Senate hostage if they want. \n \n\"I think Schumer and his conference are going to decide how beholden they are going to be to folks who don't want the government to function,\" Sasse told RCP. \n \nSchumer--who has taken to calling Trump's nominees a \"swamp Cabinet\"--said recently there are eight or nine appointees he considers controversial who will require thorough debate on the Senate floor, though he indicated he could support others who are viewed less negatively. \n \nLengthy debate remains Democrats' most potent weapon since they cannot block any of Trump's nominees without GOP help, the result of their own change to filibuster rules in 2013. Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrats' vice presidential nominee last year, said it was fair to expect extensive debate on Trump's nominees given that they could pass through with only Republican support. When asked what the confirmation process previewed in terms of bipartisanship, Kaine said it is \"too early to tell.\" \n \nSome Republicans said they believed Democrats would learn quickly that staunch opposition wouldn't be a fruitful strategy. \n \n\"They're wondering whether or not they get any advantage to this stonewalling,\" Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said. \"I don't think the American people are going to stand for it. I think they're expecting us to produce results, and if they stand in the way of that on a consistent basis, it'll be a political problem for them.\" \n \nJames Arkin is a congressional reporter for RealClearPolitics. \n \nEditorial on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JAMES ARKIN RealClearPolitics"},"topics":[],"title":"Cabinet fight!","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204173557","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:13:56Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/29/fixing_defidit.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

Guard Josh Okogie, whose playing time was limited to 18 minutes because of foul trouble, scored the game-winning basket on a layup as time expired, eliciting a full-throated roar from the Tech crowd. With the scored tied at 60, Okogie had missed two free throws with 35.8 seconds remaining, giving Notre Dame a chance to take the lead. \n   \nHowever, guard Matt Farrell missed a tough jumper, which was rebounded by guard Tadric Jackson, who dribbled upcourt before finding Okogie. \n   \nOkogie raced in from the wing, barely beating the buzzer. \n   \nBefore a full house that included Tech legends Bobby Cremins and Jarrett Jack, Tech built on their Wednesday upset of No. 6 Florida State with another exemplary defensive performance. Notre Dame, which came into the game shooting 46.9 percent from the field, was held to 40.4 percent on 23-for-57 shooting. \n   \nTech (13-8 overall, 5-4 ACC) has beaten three AP top-25 teams: North Carolina, Florida State and Notre Dame, all at McCamish. Notre Dame (17-5, 6-3) was held to its second lowest point total of the season. \n   \nJackson led the Jackets with a career-high 25 points, scoring on drives, post-ups and from the perimeter. Center Ben Lammers went all 40 minutes for the first time in his career and added 15 points with 10 rebounds, three assists and five blocks. It was his 11th double-double of the season. Guard Josh Heath handed out eight assists and came up with five steals, a career high. \n   \nNotre Dame led 19-9 at the 11:47 mark of the first half, but the Jackets began to assert themselves defensively. Tech gained the lead for first time at 26-25 with 4:54 left in the half. \n   \nMiami 77, N. Carolina 62 \n   \nCORAL GABLES, Fla. (TNS) \u2014 North Carolina has often played with the kind of offensive brilliance this season that has left school officials flipping through the record book, searching for perspective. There was some searching again on Saturday \u2014 but only to see where the Tar Heels\u2019 first-half misery might have ranked. \n   \nOne of the worst first halves in recent UNC history doomed the Tar Heels to a 77-62 defeat at Miami. The loss, which replaced the one at Georgia Tech as UNC\u2019s ugliest of the season, brought an end to the Tar Heels\u2019 seven-game winning streak. \n   \nUNC played without Theo Pinson, the 6-foot-6 junior who watched from the bench while he wore a protective boot over his right foot. Pinson, the Tar Heels\u2019 versatile forward who often provides energy, was undoubtedly missed against Miami. \n   \nSo, too, was the Tar Heels\u2019 shot-making ability and offensive rhythm. UNC (19-4, 7-2 ACC) entered the Watsco Center as one of the best offensive teams in the country, averaging nearly 90 points per game. After taking an early 11-2 lead, though, the Tar Heels had no answers for Miami\u2019s 2-3 zone. \n   \nThe Hurricanes (14-6, 4-4), led by freshman Bruce Brown and his 30 points, needed less than four minutes to erase their early nine-point deficit. Once Miami seized that lead it grew quickly, thanks in large part to a defensive performance that was every bit as good as UNC\u2019s offense was bad. \n   \nDuke 85, Wake Forest 83 \n   \nWINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (TNS) \u2014 In desperate need of a win and a team leader, No. 17 Duke got both Saturday thanks to Luke Kennard. \n   \nThe sophomore scored 34 points and hit the game-winning shot with 6.6 seconds left giving Duke an 85-83 comeback win over Wake Forest at Joel Coliseum. \n   \nKennard scored 30 points in the second half, and scored 11 points in the final 3:40 as Duke (16-5, 4-4) overcame Wake Forest\u2019s 81-71 lead. \n   \nDuke shot 63 percent in the second half. \n   \nDuke trailed by 10 points at halftime and the lead remained that margin as the Deacons held an 81-71 lead with 4:01 to play. \n   \nBut Kennard wouldn\u2019t allow Duke to go down. He hit a 3-pointer and, after a Wake Forest offensive foul, drilled a deep two to cut the deficit in half. \n   \nKeyshawn Woods nailed a 16-foot jump shot for Wake Forest but Kennard answered with a 3-pointer at 1:49 to slice Wake\u2019s lead to 83-79. \n   \nDuke forced the Demon Deacons into a shot clock violation after Woods airballed a 3-pointer. \n   \nThe Blue Devils worked to find an open shot, with Grayson Allen draining a 3-pointer with 52.5 seconds left leaving Wake Forest up 83-82. \n   \nWood misfired on a contested 3-pointer with 23 seconds left, setting the stage for Kennard\u2019s 3-pointer with 6.6 left that gave Duke an 85-83 lead.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Georgia Tech stuns No. 14 Notre Dame at buzzer","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Talbot","zipCode":"21601","state":"Maryland","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Easton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Easton Star-Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665883","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"16"},"name":"Easton Star-Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stardem.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204176495","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:02:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/stardem.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/0e/a0e3ebf1-abaf-512f-ab73-07254b551dee/588d66ec90c1d.image.jpg?resize=300%2C274"}],"video":[]}}

The No. 22 Terps were down by a dozen to Minnesota in the first half, and by nine early in the second half. They were over the foul limit with more than 12 minutes left in the game. \n   \nLed by a pair of cold-blooded freshmen, forward Justin Jackson and wing Kevin Huerter, as well as junior guard Melo Trimble, Maryland overcame the Gophers, their crowd and maybe even a trio of whistle-happy refs to win, 85-78, to match the school\u2019s best start since 1998-99. \n   \nJackson finished with a career-high 28 points on 9-for-15 shooting, including 5-for-5 from 3-point range, to go with 10 rebounds for Maryland (19-2, 7-1 Big Ten). Huerter had 19 points, hitting five of seven of his 3-pointers. \n   \nIt was orchestrated down the stretch by Trimble, who after a quiet first half finished with 13 points, nine assists and seven rebounds while committing one turnover in 33 minutes. The victory, the Terps\u2019 sixth straight, helped Maryland stay tied with Wisconsin for first place in the conference. \n   \nThe Terps matched the 19-2 start of the 1998-99 team. To end a stretch of four road games in five contests, Maryland plays at Ohio State on Tuesday. \n   \nGraduate transfer Akeem Springs led Minnesota (15-7, 3-6), which lost its fifth straight, with 23 points. Freshman forward Amir Coffey, whose 11 first-half points had helped the Gophers take the lead, did not score in the second half while being guarded mostly by Huerter. \n   \nWith the game tied at 76 with 1:47 to go, the Terps took control. Huerter hit a 3-pointer and after Minnesota center Jordan Murphy scored and was fouled, his missed free throw kept Maryland in the lead. Jackson built on it with three subsequent free throws and Trimble secured the win with another pair. \n   \nDown by seven at halftime and by nine early in the second half, the Terps climbed back behind the outside shooting of Jackson and Huerter. Two 3-pointers by Huerter came during a 12-5 run that cut the deficit to 44-42. \n   \nAfter a three-point play by Minnesota center Reggie Lynch right before the under-16 minute timeout, a layup by redshirt sophomore Ivan Bender made it a three-point deficit, 47-44. \n   \nJackson\u2019s fifth 3-pointer of the game \u2014 on as many attempts \u2014 cut the deficit to two, 49-47. But the Terps went over the foul limit with 12:12 remaining when junior guard Jaylen Brantley tried for a steal on a loose ball in the backcourt. \n   \nSprings hit both ends of a one-and-one, and after freshman guard Anthony Cowan made a tough drive at the end of the 30-second shot clock, Murphy made one of two free throws. \n   \nWith his team trailing 54-52, Cowan made a steal and layup to tie the game at 54 with a little over 10 minutes left. The Terps took their first lead of the second half at 58-56 on a drive by Trimble with 8:32 to go. \n   \nIn a span of nine possessions, there were two ties and six lead changes, the last coming when Huerter hit a 3-pointer to put Maryland up 63-61. The Terps had a chance to build on the lead, but senior center Damonte Dodd fumbled a perfect feed from Trimble into a turnover. \n   \nIf that was a physical mistake, Dodd then made two straight mental gaffes, twice stepping in the lane before Murphy missed free throws, that gave the Murphy two extra free-throw tries and helped tie the game. \n   \nBut the Terps eventually took control, not trailing after Trimble\u2019s layup gave them a 72-71 lead with 2:49 to go. \n   \nThe Terps trailed by as many as 12 points midway through the first half. \n   \nAfter jumping out to a quick 8-2 lead, Maryland went cold, watched Minnesota score the first 13 points of a 19-1 run to take a 21-9 lead on a 3-pointer by sophomore guard Dupree McBrayer. \n   \nMaryland eventually closed to within four, 23-19, after back-to-back 3-pointers by Jackson. Trailing 28-22 after a 3-pointer by Coffey, the Terps got it down to two on a baseline jumper by graduate transfer forward L.G. Gill and a breakaway layup by Trimble. \n   \nBut two straight turnovers by Gill allowed the Gophers to close the half on a 5-0 run to extend the lead to seven, 33-26. It was the largest halftime deficit for the Terps in a Big Ten game this season. Maryland shot 10-for-28 in the first half, with several missed layups included in the a 6-for-19 showing on 2-pointers. \n   \nThe Terps were 4-for-9 on 3-pointers, including Jackson making all three of his 3-point attempts. Jackson led Maryland with nine points at halftime, and Huerter added seven. Coffey led Minnesota with 11 points, four rebounds and four assists. \n   \n© 2017 The Baltimore Sun","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Jackson scores career-high 28 as Terps rally","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Talbot","zipCode":"21601","state":"Maryland","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Easton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Easton Star-Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665883","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"16"},"name":"Easton Star-Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stardem.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204177230","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T23:20:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I could feed them dog food and they'll think it's steak. Good night, you stupid idiots.\" \n \n-- Lonesome Rhodes, A Face in the Crowd \n  \nAndy Griffith and Patricia Neal starred in Elia Kazan\u2019s 1957 film A Face in the Crowd. \n  \nA decade or so ago I taught a class called Movies and Politics for a local university. We started out with Leni Riefenstahl's 1935 film Triumph of the Will , which drew mixed reviews from the upperclassmen who'd signed up for the class. Many of them had trouble getting past the black-and-white cinematography. A lot of them had trouble seeing how it could possibly have anything to do with their lives. \n \nThe moment I remember most about that class came just before the lights went out and the VCR (it was that long ago) clunked into action, when I asked my students to consider what had been going on in Europe in the '30s. At first there was no response, but finally a young man raised his hand and asked tentatively: \"The Civil War?\" \n \nTo be fair, college students generally give the answers they think their professors want to hear. They compartmentalize each class and it's only later -- if ever -- that they begin to make connections and glue the discrete pieces of their education into a coherent worldview. They thought we were going to watch movies, and most of them had their ideas about what movies were and what they weren't. And their movies didn't ask them to think about Weimar Republic politics or global depressions. Their movies were populated by action figures with uncluttered motivations. \n \nIt was interesting to watch them watch the film. Triumph of the Will is a film you feel like you've seen even if you've never committed yourself to watching it. Over the years, bits and pieces of it have lodged like shrapnel in the collective imagination; clips show up in just about every documentary made about the rise of Adolf Hitler. If you've an idea what a phrase like \"fascist architecture\" might mean, then it's likely you're drawing from the store of monochromatic images framed by Riefenstahl. \n \nThis \"documentary\" of the 1934 Nazi party congress in Nuremberg has been called the greatest propaganda film of all time. To shoot it, Riefenstahl constructed dozens of ramps, bridges and towers in the city. Along Adolf Hitler Square a ramp was built that rose to second-story level in order that Riefenstahl's cameras might dolly along above the marching storm troopers, photographing them from a birds'-eye view. A camera was installed in an elevator attached to a 120-foot flagpole at the Luitpoldhain, the parade ground where Hitler would address his Brownshirts. \n \nRiefenstahl's corps of cameramen were dressed in elite SS uniforms to intimidate and ensure their actions would not be questioned by either officious bureaucrats or the rank and file. Wooden tracks were laid so that the cameras could move between rows of troops. She commandeered fire trucks and construction cranes and even put some of her cameramen on roller skates. In all, she shot more than 61 hours of film over the course of the six-day rally, and spent months editing it down to just under two hours. \n \nWhile there is a faux Wagnerian score, there is no spoken commentary in the film. Riefenstahl considered voice-overs \"the enemy of film\" and left all verbalization to Hitler and other Nazi leaders. Riefenstahl did not invent or make any attempt to influence the actions of any of the people she photographed. Instead she choreographed the images and sounds. She worked with marching men and swastikas, banners and eagles, with Teutonic folk songs and oratory. She made a mad, solemn, chilling film that manages to be -- sometimes in almost the same moment -- tedious and fascinating, awesome and terrible. \n \n... \n \nAs Triumph of the Will was inspiring moviegoers in Europe -- it won a gold medal at the 1935 Venice Biennale although the Nazis didn't make a serious effort to promote it outside of Germany -- Sinclair Lewis' novel It Can't Happen Here was published, a book inspired by the rise of Huey P. Long who was preparing to challenge Franklin D. Roosevelt for the White House in 1936 (Long was assassinated in September 1935). \n \nIt Can't Happen Here presents the story of Sen. Berzelius \"Buzz\" Windrip, a populist Democrat, who becomes president in the late 1930s on a platform that claims to speak for \"Forgotten Men,\" championing a redistributionist platform similar to Long's proposed \"Share the Wealth\" program. (Long was also the model for Willie Stark, the protagonist of Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men , which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1947.) \n \nSome people will tell you they want art to provide them a respite from politics; others will point out that every choice is political. Movies are assembled by people with points of view. And while all that ultimately matters to the market is whether you buy a ticket, it's interesting to note how artists interact with politics. Americans have been warned that it -- whatever you imagine \"it\" to be -- can happen here throughout our history. \n \nIn 1972 director Michael Ritchie and movie star Robert Redford collaborated on a savvy, keenly observed political satire called The Candidate . In that film, Redford played an idealistic young politician who's free to run his campaign for the U.S. Senate with reckless integrity because of the almost absolute certainty he will lose. Only he doesn't lose and the movie ends on a particularly unsettling note as the euphoria of Redford's character's unexpected victory is interrupted by an aide asking, \"What will we do now?\" \n \nIn 1998 director and movie star Warren Beatty provided the answer with his brilliant satire Bulworth : You grow corrupt and crazy. \n \n... \n \nOn Jan. 20, the cable television network TCM (Turner Classic Movies) programmed another movie I used to show in my class: Elia Kazan's 1957 A Face in the Crowd starring Andy Griffith as Lonesome Rhodes, a folk-singing drifter who becomes a populist celebrity and ends up a powerful megalomaniac eventually undone by a spurned woman (Patricia Neal) and a hot microphone. \n \nTCM's timing seemed suspicious, since it's not hard to draw parallels between the ascension of former reality TV star Donald Trump to the White House and Rhodes' character arc. (Though Trump weathered his hot microphone moment.) But the network explained it wasn't trolling the new president. The decision to air A Face in the Crowd (which I am required by statute to remind you was filmed largely in Piggott because Ernest Hemingway associate Otto \"Toby\" Bruce recommended the location to screenwriter Budd Schulberg) had been made long before Trump won election on Nov. 8. It was part of a birthday celebration of A Face in the Crowd co-star Neal, born on Jan. 20, 1926. \n \nAt least that's the story they're going with. \n \n... \n \nHaving seen the film a few times, I have some ambivalence about it. Griffith is remarkable, and anyone who only knows him through his amiable performances as Sheriff Andy Taylor or lawyer Matlock may be surprised by the depth and darkness of his character. Neal is also superb. \n \nBut the script is a little too pat -- as The  New York Times' Bosley Crowther observed in a contemporary review, \"so hypnotized are they by his presence\" -- and his undoing feels more like a function of changing fashion than a fundamental repudiation of his rhetoric. I get the feeling that Kazan and Schulberg had almost as much contempt for their audience as Rhodes had for the yokels who uncritically embraced him. \n \nI've always preferred Tim Robbins' 1992 film Bob Roberts, which feels in some ways like a covert remake of A Face in the Crowd with a blacker ending. In that movie, Robbins plays a folksinging right-wing senatorial candidate -- a hybrid of Woody Guthrie and Wall Street's Gordon Gekko -- who operates a financial brokerage firm out of his campaign bus. \n \nOne of the most interesting things about the film was the soundtrack. Robbins and his composer brother David, crafted a number of songs inverting the sensibilities of Bob Dylan (\"The Times Are Changin' Back\") and Guthrie (\"This Land Is My Land\") for the film. Robbins elected not to release a soundtrack album for fear they would be co-opted by conservatives. \n \nIt has been said if you want to understand liberal American politics, watch The Candidate and Bulworth . If you want to understand conservative American politics, watch Bob Roberts . \n \n... \n \nSome of us use movies as a respite from the workaday world. Ask a typical moviegoer why he subscribes to his drug of choice and more often than not he'll say something about wanting to \"escape.\" A giant industry has grown up to transport rooms of people to alternate realities for a couple of hours at a time. Movies are about entertainment, a kind of passive recreation that allows us to voluntarily submit to the flickering commercial visions of dream retailers. One pays good money to be removed from the realm of one's troubles. \n \nYet it is also true that every movie is an advertisement for something, for a way of looking at the world or for the leading actor's favorite brand of cigarettes. Movies sell products and ideas, and while accidents certainly happen, nothing that occurs within the boundaries of the frame should be taken as randomly selected. Movies are not real life but arrangements of light and sound, illusions projected on the wall and assembled in the mind of the watcher. An unwatched movie is an uncompleted work -- as receivers of the signal we are all collaborators in the process. The audience performs a function analogous to the top of a guitar; it works as a sounding board, amplifying and coloring, turning so much excited air into a recognizable tone. \n \nThe problem is that the American mind has been vulgarized to a shocking degree. A lot of us have genuine problems recognizing the subtleties inherent in human endeavor. It is not impossible for a Riefenstahl to make a film that is great and horrible, for an Oliver Stone to make a movie that is historically inaccurate -- loaded with what we might call \"alternative facts\" -- yet profoundly \"true.\" We've given up on the old ways of reading novels and poetry. We've become so literal-minded that we can't reconcile ourselves to the idea that good fiction is inherently more honest than what passes for journalism. \n \nA journalist faces epistemological limits. The more honest the journalist, the less he is able to pretend to know. The artist is free to create fictions that suggest the deeper movements of the heart. The author is god of his universe, and while even a god can't know his own motives, we can trust what he puts on the page. \n \nBecause market forces will always convert the movies to, at best, infotainment, we ought to be particularly suspicious of movies that purport to tell the truth about anything. \n \nMaybe my students had the right idea. \n \nTightly choreographed and beautifully photographed, a product of fascist discipline with practically no narration to lead our thinking, Triumph of the Will shows rather than tells. And it is possible to regard it as a formal masterpiece. You have to know context to recognize it as a monstrosity of misplaced talent. \n \nWatch it in a vacuum, the horror vanishes. My students probably thought of it as just another obstacle placed in their way as they strove toward a credential that they hoped would someday mean more money in their pockets. A few let their annoyance show.

Both were terrific from the back and at the net too. \n \nSania was also broken in the third game. It was Cabal's brilliant volley pick up which he placed well beyond the two players to earn a break point. \n \nSpears smashed a backhand service return winner to take the break as the second seeds trailed 0-3. \n opens in new window \n \nThe American had an easy hold in the next to make it 4-0. The second seeds finally got on board when Dodig held the fifth game but they had already suffered the damage. \n \nServing to stay in the opening set at 1-5, Sania saved a deciding a point to hold. \n \nSpears was now serving for the set and lost the first two points to be 0-30 and soon Dodig found a forehand winner to earn a breakpoint but could not convert. Sania hit a backhand wide on the deciding point to concede the first set. \n \nDodig's serve was again under pressure as he faced a breakpoint and a deciding point in the first game of the second set but managed to save both. \n \nCabal served a double fault at 40-30 to face a deciding point and the second seeds latched on to that to take a 2-0 lead as Spears hit a backhand long. \n \nSania had an easy hold to make it 3-0 as the Indo-Croatian pair was back in the match. However, Sania was broken in the seventh game which allowed the rivals to neutralise the advantage. \n opens in new window \n \nThe Indian committed a double fault to be down by two breakpoints and Spears smashed one overhead volley to convert the first.

I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support ... In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, 'We may have all come on different ships, but we are in the same boat now.'\" \n\nAnd Cook apparently has no qualms expressing his opposition to the ban to President Trump , writing, \"We have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our coworkers and our company.\" \n\nCook also addressed how the travel ban is directly affecting the Cupertino, California, company's employees, writing, \"There are employees at Apple who are directly affected by yesterday's immigration order. Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them.\" \n\nMARK ZUCKERBERG , FACEBOOK \n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page on Friday, \"I'm concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump. We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don't pose a threat will live in fear of deportation.\" \n\nSUNDAR PICHAI , GOOGLE \n\n \nLike Apple's Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai also addressed the impact of the ban on his employees. \n\"We're upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US,\" Mr. Pichai said in an email to employees, obtained by The Wall Street Journal . \"It's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues.\" \n\nTRAVIS KALANICK, UBER \n\nThe CEO of San Francisco-based Uber, Kalanick said the ban goes against American values. \n\n\"Allowing people from all around the world to come here and make America their home has largely been the U.S.'s policy since its founding,\" Kalanick wrote in an email to staff that he shared on his Facebook page. \"That means this ban will impact many innocent people-an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump's first business advisory group meeting. \n\nSATYA NADELLA , MICROSOFT \n\nMicrosoft's Indian-born CEO, Satya Nadella, addressed his own background in a Linkedin post. \n\n \n\"As an immigrant and as a CEO, I've both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world,\" he wrote. \"We will continue to advocate on this important topic.\" \nAARON LEVIE, BOX \n\nThe CEO of Palo Alto, California-based enterprise cloud company Box, Levie tweeted, \"On every level -moral, humanitarian, economic, logical, etc.- this ban is wrong and is completely antithetical to the principles of America.\" \n\nDREW HOUSTON, DROPBOX \n\n\"Executive orders affecting world's most vulnerable are un-American,\" tweeted Drew Houston, CEO of Dropbox, the San Francisco-based file sharing service. \"Dropbox embraces people from all countries and faiths.\" \n\nABC News' Zunaira Zaki contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"CEOs Slam Trump Travel Ban, Vow to Support Affected Employees","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Harris","zipCode":"77005","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Houston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KTRK TV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659628","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"292"},"name":"KTRK TV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://abclocal.go.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204188393","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Should everyone be avoiding it, or just those who have allergies? \n \nWhen you pour water into a bowl of wheatflour, the reason it sticks together is gluten. \n \nGluten is a family of proteins and the two main ones are glutenin and glaidin. Glaidin is the protein responsible for the negative health effects of grains. \n \nToday, most gluten comes from sources of wheat. If you took a modern-day strain of wheat and compared it to a strain that was available to us 30 years ago (before agriculture took off as a business), you would be surprised. It is biologically and genetically different from the original wheat grain, as it is a combination of different plants compared to the old wheat. \n \nThere are many different varieties of wheat. Years ago, we consumed varieties such as kamut and emmer, but almost all the wheat eaten today is from high-yield dwarf wheat, which is developed by genetic manipulation and cross-breeding. Dwarf wheat is much cheaper. It also has some differences in nutritional properties such as protein content, and lesser amounts of nutrients such as magnesium, zinc, copper and iron than found in, for example, kamut wheat. \n \nMany studies show modern wheat varieties tend to raise our sugar levels at a much faster rate. \n \nTwo slices of brown bread, for instance, raise your sugar levels as much as a bar of chocolate would \u2013 a reason we see a spike in the number of people suffering from type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance and so on. \n \nWheat also causes gut inflammation. If you are struggling with diabetes, acne or elevated fasting insulin levels, try to cut back on wheat to see if there are any positive changes.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Why is gluten such a problem?","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Friday Magazine","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"460439393","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"name":"Friday Magazine","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://fridaymagazine.ae"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204198196","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Now the dust has settled, is it all feeling a little...anticlimatic? Don't panic, we've got some practical, easy ways to stay positive this month: \n 1. Be easier on yourself  \n\n \nIt\u2019s gotten to the final week of January and you\u2019ve already fallen at the first hurdle. You couldn\u2019t even go one month without ditching your three-times-a-week gym resolution or reinstating the Facebook account you deleted in the hope of curbing your obsessive social media habit. To which we say: Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. Pretty much anyone who has achieved success experienced setbacks on their way, it doesn\u2019t mean they packed the whole thing in and went home. Take a deep breath, give yourself a day or two, and try again. The great news is, you\u2019ll probably find achieving your aims slightly easier the second (and third and fourth) time around because you won\u2019t be starting from scratch. \n 2. Be realistic   \n\n \n\u2026Having said this, the problem might be that you were a little too ambitious to begin with. Setting yourself the task to have learned another language, written a book and achieved a Khloe Kardashian level \u2018revenge body\u2019 by the time February rolls around may have sounded exciting, but you were likely setting yourself up to fail. There\u2019s no shame in moving the goalposts if it means you actually reach a goal post rather than collapsing from overexertion halfway down the pitch. (Ok, our sports metaphors may need a little work here\u2026) \n 3. Don\u2019t let the calendar define you  \n\n \nHere in the UAE we\u2019re blessed with often balmy winter weather, so we\u2019re much less likely to suffer from the Seasonal Affective Disorder that our friends and family in colder, wetter countries are experiencing. But even then all the talk of the post-New Year slump can get to you. It\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy, in which we\u2019re convinced that the first month of the year will be one hard slog full of holiday weight, depleted bank accounts and failing resolutions and so that\u2019s all we end up focusing on. If we reset the switch and started thinking of January like every other month of the year we may just feel a little less effected by the doom and gloom. \n 4. Get out more  \n\n \nWe know that for many reasons this sounds like an awful idea. Money is low, we\u2019re more insecure about our appearance than ever and we\u2019re dreading people asking us how the resolutions are getting on - but it is absolutely proven that social interactions make us feel better. You don\u2019t have to turn into a party animal for the month (and you probably went to enough festive parties last month to last you for, well, the year) but making the effort to grab a coffee with a friend you haven\u2019t seen since the holiday break can generate a lot more good will to mankind than you\u2019d think. Then you just might be able to tolerate that post-work office gathering the week after. Baby steps, people. \n 5. Find a new perspective  \n\n \nAs expats we tend to jet off to visit family for the holidays or take some time away, so returning home to the daily grind can feel kind of miserable. But now is the perfect moment to see where we live with new eyes. The UAE is hugely popular with people coming here on their own holidays for countless reasons - reasons that we\u2019re quick to forget when running around completing life\u2019s day-to-day admin. Whether it takes doing a typically touristy activity like going to the top of the Burj Khalifa, or even just taking a stroll along the new canal, it\u2019s worth reminding ourselves of our unique location and all it has to offer. \n 6. Reminisce  \n\n \nDon\u2019t cry because it\u2019s over, smile because it happened\u2026or something to that effect. It might seem counter-productive to dwell on all the good times we had in the festive period; visiting family and friends, acting out beloved traditions and the general cheer associated with the end of the year can seem far, far away. But like Harry Potter and his patronus*, banish the dark doldrums of January by conjuring up a joyful memory from the recent months. The happiness value of good experiences doesn\u2019t have to expire the moment the decorations are taken down or the confetti cleared and calling upon them at a dreary moment can be surprisingly uplifting \u2013 they will, after all, be eventually coming round again this year. \n \n*Prisoner of Azkaban, in case you were wondering \n 7. Plan ahead  \n\n \nHonestly, it\u2019s never too early to start planning the next big thing to look forward to. It can be a friend\u2019s birthday or your own, a short staycation or the trip of a life time. These challenging 31 days will fly by if you\u2019re too busy thinking about the fabulous year you\u2019re going to have to notice them. \n \nPhotos by istock","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"7 ways to beat the January blues","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Aquarius Magazine","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"454114225","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Aquarius Magazine","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://aquarius.ae"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204202422","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:27:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}
