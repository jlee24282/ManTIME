Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 10 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Forsyth","zipCode":"27116","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Winston Salem","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WXII 12","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688608","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"92"},"name":"WXII 12","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wxii12.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197358420","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

All of them can be effective depending on the audience you are attempting to reach. However, some jobs require specific skills or backgrounds that make free advertising ineffective. \n   \nPaid advertising is often the necessary channel to let people know you are hiring. Make sure you select the right venues for the type of people you are trying to attract. There are many niche employment sites and specialty job boards where individuals in a specific industry will look for work. \n   \nThe vast number of online niche job boards is amazing. Many are owned by other, more general job board companies and include job-seeker resumes in multiple databases. To find these niche boards, pretend you are a job seeker and do an online search, using the key words for your industry or the position. The job postings nearest to the top of your list likely will generate the best results for you as well. Now you can set up an account or reach out to the job board about the cost of posting a job. \n   \nTraditional job boards such as Careerbuilder and Monster might also help you find local talent. However, there are some new options such as Indeed, Glassdoor, SimplyHired and others that are becoming popular. Before paying for an ad on a job board, find out how much activity they have on their site in the area (zip code). It might be helpful to search what other jobs similar to yours are available on these sites to see how much traffic they generate. \n   \nConsider specialty magazines or trade journals as well. Most trade journals have classified advertising in the back or even allow for paid ads on their websites. Even trade associations offer job ads, some may be free to members, but most do charge a fee. The benefit is that your ad will reach people who are in your industry and very qualified.  \n   \nSocial media \n   \nLinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, used properly, can also be great sources for finding people. LinkedIn has a jobs section for businesses to post ads and then pay to have them shown to people who qualify for the position. Reaching out to individuals through social media, even if they are not actively looking for work, can potentially set you up with a great new employee. \n   \nStaffing firms screen people daily who are looking for work and can match someone who has recently been in their office or has been a great worker on other temporary assignments and send them to you to fill a position immediately. Since they are the employer of record, if the person doesn\u2019t work out, let the staffing firm know, and they will counsel the person or replace them immediately. If you need help immediately, contact a staffing firm. While it may seem expensive, ask yourself how much it is costing you to not have the position filled right now? \n   \nSpecialty recruiters and head hunters \n   \nFor difficult to fill positions that require more than just a job posting, a help wanted sign or an ad, specialty recruiters take finding people to a different level. These individuals network with other professionals, call into competitors and actively identify and go after top talent for your organization. They are professionals who you can also count on to represent your company very well. \n   \nIf your company doesn\u2019t budget for recruiting, these resources may seem expensive initially. However, if they can help you reach more potential employees in less time, how much less will it cost than not having the position filled? \n   \n Mike Calvin is an Employment Consultant with 1st Fruits Consulting and helps organizations throughout the country with their hiring needs including full life-cycle recruiting, candidate sourcing, selection process, interviewing and assessments, and win-win negotiating.

Seventh St., with the goal of providing an entertaining, Mardi Gras-themed event for attendees while raising money for the museum. The evening will be a memorable occasion for \"party-seekers\" for a number of reasons, said Leisa Gramlich, executive director for the Fort Smith Museum of History. \n \n\"This is Pard Gras, our annual fundraiser that is re-imagined,\" she said. \"We've crossed out the M in Mardi Gras and made it a P, for pardi, like party.  \n \n\"We're so excited about all of this,\" Gramlich added of the 21-and-older fundraiser. \"We're excited that the new venue is Shipley Baking Co., and we have a new band, Full House, which is from Fayetteville.

While at Edmondson's establishment, the Shipleys learned the production and retail aspects of the business. \n \nThe Shipleys established smaller bakeries in McAlester, Okla., and Muskogee, Okla., in 1923 and 1924, respectively. In 1926, the Shipleys purchased a bakery in Fayetteville, leading the way for Harry Shipley to run the Fort Smith bakery and Garvin Shipley to oversee the bakeries in Fayetteville and Oklahoma. \n \n\"So many people in Fort Smith remember the baking company and smelled that bread,\" Gramlich said. \"It was so nice.\" \n \nPardi Gras is expected to draw 400 people, she said. \n \n\"This is our largest fundraiser of the year, and all of the proceeds will go to help us with the museum's daily operating expenses,\" Gramlich said. \"We've had a ticket-price increase this year for the fundraiser, so hopefully we'll be able to raise more than $30,000 for the museum.\" \n \nTickets are $100 per person and $1,000 for a table for 10 and can be purchased by calling 783-7841 and at www.fortsmithmuseum.org. \n \n\"The Fort Smith Museum of History is important, and so is the Pardi Gras fundraiser,\" Gramlich said. \"People who attend this fundraiser, that is how we keep our doors open.

And no rain \u2014 maybe that\u2019s a good sign for the year.\u201d \n \nKaval told The Chronicle earlier in the week that the team is still evaluating three or four stadium sites, and on Saturday, he had drones surveying FanFest to get an idea of crowd flow and foot traffic for the potential Howard Terminal location. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to walk around and see all the energy and enthusiasm and not feel excited,\u201d general manager David Forst said. \u201cUltimately, what this leads to remains to be see, but this is a great showing of A\u2019s fans and A\u2019s excitement. A huge part of what Dave wants to do is connect to the fans and involve them in the process of what we\u2019re building in Oakland.\u201d \n \nBriefly: There were some humorous moments during the question-and-answer sessions with fans, including one fan pressing Doolittle on when he might propose to his longtime girlfriend, Eireann Dolan (he seemed to have trouble with his microphone just then for some reason) and another asking Doolittle for his favorite \u201cStar Wars\u201d moment. (He liked \u201cRogue One\u201d a lot). \u2026 Forst, asked about the A\u2019s difficulties in keeping top players, said, \u201cEveryone was tired of hearing during the playoffs, \u2018Look at all these ex-A\u2019s playing for other teams.\u2019 \u2026 The goal is we get a new building and we hold onto all these guys beyond their first few years and create lifelong Oakland A\u2019s.\u201d \u2026 Asked about potentially trading right-hander Sonny Gray at midseason if Gray bounces back strong, Forst said, \u201cI want to have Sonny here 10 more years. (A\u2019s executive) Billy Beane wants to have Sonny here 10 more years.\u201d \n \nSusan Slusser is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: athletics news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Lots of goodwill, excitement at A\u2019s Jack London Square FanFest","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"San Francisco Chronicle.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"535645800","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"165"},"name":"San Francisco Chronicle.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Athletics","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sfchronicle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197364137","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2830","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Dubbo","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Liberal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169757732","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Daily Liberal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailyliberal.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197367291","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n \n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n \n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n \nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n \n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n \n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\" \n \n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"Government","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Northern Territory Government","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"470578777","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"168"},"name":"Northern Territory Government","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Global","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sbs.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197372249","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2830","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Dubbo","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Liberal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169757732","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Daily Liberal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailyliberal.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197374571","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He did some shoveling outside his Williston home, and then went inside to take ibuprofen for a nagging pain in his arm. \n\nHalf an hour later, the pain was gone, and Boone was celebrating the holiday with his family. \n\nBut later that night, he woke up from an early evening nap in front of the television to raging pain in his arm, back and chest. \n\n\"I was hurting so bad I started breaking out in a sweat,\" Boone said. \"The chest pain was the worst it felt like somebody was sitting on me.\" \n\nSoon he was sick, and his wife called for an ambulance, which managed to make the trip to his subdivision on Harvest Hill Drive, but paramedics had to borrow Boone's snow-blower to clear a path to load him into the vehicle. \n\nThe weather that earlier had meant little more than a blustery white Christmas was now suddenly a terrifying barrier to the life-saving medical treatment that emergency room staff at CHI St. Alexius Health in Williston almost immediately knew Boone needed. \n\n\"We stabilized him as best we could, but at that time I realized our resources were exhausted and he would not survive if we didn't get him elsewhere,\" said Karen Johnson, a certified registered nurse anesthetist, who tended to Boone that night. \n\nThe 45-year-old was having a massive heart attack due to double blockages, and needed to be transported to Trinity Hospital in Minot for surgery. \n\nHigh winds were keeping a medical flight crew on the ground, and local ambulance drivers said the snow was piling up too high to make such a long trip possible. \n\nBy 1 a.m., after Boone's heart had stopped for a second time, Johnson made a call to Rick Sigvaldsen, Williston's Department of Transportation district maintenance supervisor. \n\nShe asked if a snowplow could escort an ambulance to Minot, and the response was immediate. \n\n\"Absolutely,\" he said. \n\nWith snowplow driver Ed Nelson clearing a path, an ambulance carrying Boone, a paramedic and members of the Valley Med-Flight crew made its way to Minot, where a cardiologist put a stent in Boone's heart. \n\nThe trip took four hours. \n\n\"There's absolutely no way we would have done it without the snowplow,\" Corey Johnson, a Williston paramedic who rode in the back with Boone, said. \n\nThe decision to call wasn't made easily, Johnson said, pointing out that she would not have asked others to travel in risky conditions if so much hadn't been at stake, the Williston Herald (http://bit.ly/2kjDsZD ) reports. \n\n\"I would never have considered calling anybody out into those conditions if it hadn't been to save someone's life,\" she said, adding that the response she got was not unexpected. \"I was relieved, but not truly surprised because of the nature of the people in this community.\" \n\nBoone, a Mississippi native, is back to work in the oil industry, and enjoying his first grandchild, who was born a month ago. The two met for the first time after Boone's discharge from the hospital. \n\n\"I can't thank them enough. If it was not for them I wouldn't be here today \u2014 the snow plow driver played just as much a part as the doctors,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\nInformation from: Williston Herald, http://www.willistonherald.com \n\nAn AP Member Exchange shared by the Williston Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Elizabeth HackenburgThe Williston Herald"},"topics":[],"title":"Man suffering a massive heart attack saved by snowplow","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Harrison","zipCode":"39507","state":"Mississippi","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Gulfport","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sun Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658155","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6447"},"name":"Sun Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Health","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sunherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2kjDsZD","http://www.willistonherald.com/"],"sequenceId":"695197383762","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Burrell has yet to make a ruling on that case, as the Daily Mail \u2019s attorneys are arguing that the court does not have jurisdiction to hear the case in Maryland, since it has no offices or ties to the state. \n Melania Trump\u2019s Most Interesting Quotes  \nIf the case against Tarpley continues to move forward, it is set to begin on November 6, 2017. \n\n \nWant stories like these delivered straight to your inbox?","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Joyce Chen"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: celebrity gossip","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Melania Trump\u2019s Libel Lawsuit Against Blogger to Move Forward 17 hours ago","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"US Weekly Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664901","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3462"},"name":"US Weekly Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Gossip","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.usmagazine.com"},"linkedArticles":[{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29389819142"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29389819148"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29389819152"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29389921735"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29389921738"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29389921742"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390024628"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390024636"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390024638"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390125045"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390125046"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390125049"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390125050"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390125051"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390125053"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390125055"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390216625"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390216629"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390216630"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390216635"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390304362"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390304363"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390304364"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390304365"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390304368"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390588917"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390588918"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390853446"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390853447"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29390941971"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391120114"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391368717"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391620865"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391781701"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391857779"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392416437"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392416438"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392416439"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392669394"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392743122"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29394892714"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29394892717"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29394892718"}],"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/melania-trump-defamation-suit-against-political-blogger-can-move-forward-n713116","http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/melania-trump-libel-suit-blogger-234263","http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/27/media/melania-trump-defamation-lawsuit/"],"sequenceId":"695197391964","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It is caused by a virus that lives in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person. Only humans spread the measles virus, no other animal species is known to spread or habour measles. It is a vaccine preventable disorder, yet continues to afflict children around the world. \n \nThe measles virus that attacks the respiratory tract is one of the most contagious diseases known. Children are especially vulnerable to measles and 350 die from it every day globally despite the availability of a safe, effective and affordable vaccine. Measles survivors are often left with life-long disabilities, such as blindness, deafness or brain damage. \n \nMeasles is an endemic disease, meaning it is continually present in a community and many people develop resistance. However, if measles enters an area where the people have never been exposed, the result can be devastating. \n \nHow it is transmitted \n \nMeasles virus is highly contagious. It can spread through coughing and sneezing and can live for up to two hours in airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed. If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90 percent of the people close by will also become infected if they are not immune. Infected persons can spread measles to others from four days before through four days after the rash appears. \n \nMeasles rash & Koplik spots \n \nThe infection starts with fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes, and sore throat. Three to five days after symptoms begin, a rash breaks out. It usually begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and spread downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet. Small raised bumps may also appear on top of the flat red spots. Two or three days after symptoms begin, tiny white spots (Koplik spots) may appear inside the mouth. The fever may spike to more than 104° Fahrenheit. After a few days, the fever subsides and the rash fades. \n \nSymptoms \n \nMeasles symptoms can often include a reddish-brown spotty rash but usually include fever and at least one of the three C\u2019s \u2013 cough, coryza (runny nose), and conjunctivitis. Symptoms will appear about 9-11 days after initial infection. \n \nFever \u2013 this may be mild to severe and can reach 40.6 degrees Centigrade for a number of days. Fever may drop and then rise again when the rash appear. Although the majority of childhood rashes are not measles, a child should be taken to the doctors if it is suspected that it could be measles. \n \nSuspicion is stronger if symptoms do not improve, or get worse, or the fever rises to above 38 degrees Centigrade and other symptoms have resolved except for fever. Symptoms of measles can include watery eyes, sneezing, and a dry hacking cough. It takes 1-3 weeks for the measles virus to establish itself. There is no specific treatment for measles; prevention is better than cure. Pregnant women should not take the vaccine. \n \n\n \nHow infection develops \n \nAs soon as the virus enters the body, it multiplies in the back of the throat, lungs, and the lymphatic system. It later infects and replicates in the urinary tract, eyes, blood vessels, and central nervous system. Experts say it takes 1-3 weeks for the virus to establish itself. However, people show symptoms 9-11 days after acquiring the infection. \n \nA person who has had measles before does not become infected again; cases of re-infection are very rare. However, anyone who has never been infected or vaccinated that breathes in infected droplets or is in close physical contact with an infected person is likely to become ill. Approximately 90 percent of people who are not immune will develop measles if they share the same house with an infected person. \n \nDiagnosis \n \nA doctor will be able to diagnose measles fairly easily if the signs and symptoms are present. A blood test will confirm the presence of the virus. In Nigeria measles is a notifiable disease. This means that doctors have to notify the authorities of any suspected cases. If the patient is a child, the doctor will also notify the school. A child with measles should not return to school until at least 5 days after the rash has appeared. \n \nTreatment \n \nThere is no specific measles treatment. If there are no complications, the doctor will recommend plenty of rest and normal measures to control the fever and prevent dehydration (drink fluids). Symptoms will usually go away within 7-10 days. If a child has measles, the following measures may help: \n \nFever \u2013 if the temperature is high, the child should be kept cool, but not too cold. Paracetamol or acetaminophen are effective in controlling fever, as well as aches and pain. Children under 16 should not be given aspirin. \n \nPhotophobia \u2013 as the child may be sensitive to light, keeping the lights dim or the room darkened may help. Sunglasses may also help. \n \nConjunctivitis \u2013 if there is crustiness around the eyes, gently clean with a warm, damp cloth. \n \nCough \u2013 cough medicines will not relieve the cough. If the child is over 12, a glass of warm water with a teaspoon of lemon juice and two teaspoons of honey may help. Do not give honey to infants. \n \nDehydration \u2013 make sure the child is hydrated. If a child has a fever, he can become dehydrated more quickly. Encourage the child to drink plenty of fluids. \n \nIsolation \u2013 during the contagious stage, infected children should be kept away from school and should not return to activities that involve human interaction. Non-immunized people who have never had measles should be isolated. \n \nVitamin A supplements \u2013 significantly help prevent complications caused by measles. Supplements are recommended for children with vitamin A deficiency and children under the age of 2 who have severe measles. As measles is caused by a virus, antibiotics will not have any effect on it. However, antibiotics may sometimes be prescribed for any additional bacterial infections that develop. \n \nComplications \n \nComplications from measles are fairly common and are more likely to be worse for patients who have weak immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or leukemia, those with vitamin deficiency, and very young children. Adults over the age of 20 are more likely to have complications than healthy children over the age of 5. \n \nThe complications can include diarrhoea, vomiting, eye infection, laryngitis and bronchitis, Otitis media, Febrile seizure and Pneumonia. Hepatitis, Encephalitis \u2013 approximately 1 in every 1,000 patients with measles develops encephalitis and Thrombocytopenia among others. \n \nMeasles during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, premature labor, or low birth weights. If an individual is planning on getting pregnant and has not been vaccinated against measles, they should speak with their doctor. \n \nVaccine protection \n \nIn the decade before 1963 when a measles vaccine became available, nearly all children in the world had measles infection by the time they were 15 years of age. Measles vaccine is usually combined with mumps and rubella vaccines, hence the name Measles, Mumps & Rubella or MMR vaccine. The World Health Organization recommends that children should receive two doses of MMR, the first dose at 12 through 15 months of age and the second dose at 4 through six years of age. The MMR vaccine is very safe and effective and the best way to protect children and prevent them from spreading the disease to others. The success of measles vaccination has been dramatic. \n \nPeople who have already had measles are immune and will not get it again \u2013 cases of re-infection are extremely rare. For people who are not immune, there is the measles vaccine. \n \nWhen should children be vaccinated? \n \nChildren should receive the MMR vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age, and then again (a booster) before entering school when they are 4-6 years old. Babies carry their mother\u2019s immunity for a few months after birth if their mothers are immune. Sometimes babies require vaccination before they are 12 months old. This may happen if there is a serious outbreak in their area, or if they are going to travel to an area with a serious outbreak. In such cases, they can receive the vaccination from the age of 6 months and will need a booster when they are 12 months old. \n \nProgress against measles has been significant. UNICEF and its partners have successfully vaccinated 1.8 billion children worldwide since 2000, helping global death rates to plummet by 79 per cent and saving more than 20 million young lives. But it remains deadly \u2013 some 360 children still die every day from the disease, which attacks the respiratory tract. Survivors are often left with life-long disabilities, such as blindness, deafness or brain damage. Don\u2019t let your children be victims. Get them immunised. \n \nThe post MEASLES: It is not just a little rash appeared first on Vanguard News . \n \nOriginal Article \n \nMEASLES: It Is Not Just A Little Rash \nMEASLES: It Is Not Just A Little Rash \nMEASLES: It Is Not Just A Little Rash \nMEASLES: It Is Not Just A Little Rash \nMEASLES: It Is Not Just A Little Rash \n MEASLES: It Is Not Just A Little Rash  MEASLES: It Is Not Just A Little Rash","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[{"name":"Public health news","group":"Science"}],"title":"MEASLES:  It is not just a little rash","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Ondo State News Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608959245","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Ondo State News Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://ondostatenews.online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/01/measles-not-just-little-rash/","http://www.vanguardngr.com/"],"sequenceId":"695197395628","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Measles.png"}],"video":[]}}

The Israeli military confirmed the account, saying that its forces were attacked with pipe bombs in the northern West Bank city of Jenin before they responded. \n \nSince 2015, Palestinian attackers have carried out numerous stabbings, shootings and vehicular assaults that killed 40 Israelis and two visiting Americans. Israeli forces killed 235 Palestinians in the same period, most identified by Israel as attackers. \n \nRights groups have accused Israel of using excessive force in some of the confrontations. Israel blames the violence on Palestinian incitement, while Palestinians say it stems from frustration over decades of Israeli rule. \n      Next Up in Nation World    Returnships and getting back to work  \nby Ideas and Voices team \n \nFrom The Atlantic: \u201cThe term \u2018returnship\u2019 was coined by Goldman Sachs in 2008, when the investment bank started a 10-week program for women and men with career gaps who were looking to get back to full-time work.

Both were terrific from the back and at the net too. \n \nSania was also broken in the third game. It was Cabal\u2019s brilliant volley pick up which he placed well beyond the two players to earn a break point. \n \nSpears smashed a backhand service return winner to take the break as the second seeds trailed 0-3. \n \nThe American had an easy hold in the next to make it 4-0. \n \nThe second seeds finally got on board when Dodig held the fifth game but they had already suffered the damage. \n \nServing to stay in the opening set at 1-5, Sania saved a deciding a point to hold. \n \nSpears was now serving for the set and lost the first two points to be 0-30 and soon \nDodig found a forehand winner to earn a breakpoint but could not convert.

However, Sania was broken in the seventh game which allowed the rivals to neutralise the advantage. \n \nThe Indian committed a double fault to be down by two breakpoints and Spears smashed one overhead volley to convert the first.

Australian Test opener Matt Renshaw is seeking the counsel of former great Matthew Hayden for tips on how to conquer spin in India as he embarks on his first Test tour. , Renshaw is not allowing himself to be daunted by the prospect of playing on the dust bowls of the subcontinent against the world's No.1 Test nation.\n\nSince recovering from concussion, the youngster has been gearing his game for the examination by spin he will face against Virat Kohli's rampaging team. His preparation has included batting on an \"extreme\" turner at Cricket Australia's National Cricket Centre in Brisbane which was designed to exaggerate the conditions he will confront in India.\n\nRenshaw is due to fly to Dubai on Monday for Australia's pre-tour camp but not before consulting fellow Queenslander Hayden, Hayden famously mastered the sweep shot after weeks of intense practice with his brother on a specially made dusty pitch in Brisbane. His haul of 549 runs at 109.8 in three matches is the second most by an Australian in India, behind only Kim Hughes, who hit 594 runs from a six-Test series in 1979/80.\n\nWhile Australia failed to end their drought in 2001, Hayden's success on that campaign instilled great confidence in his teammates for the successful 2004 mission.\n\n\"I got his number off Andy Bichel, so I might give him a call to get a few quick pointers before I head off,\" Renshaw said. \"I'm not as experienced in the sweep shot as him. [\"I'll have] a fair bit more practice over the next couple of months.\n\nDespite honing his craft on the bouncy Gabba wicket, Renshaw says he is confident against spin, although there are no players in Australia in the class of Indian duo Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.\n\n\"I'm not too bad against spin in Australia but I've never experienced spin in India, so it's hard to say [how I will go],\" Renshaw said.\n\nUnder the watch of Queensland coach Phil Jaques, Renshaw has been preparing on a pitch that is offering more spin and bounce than what he will get in India and, in his own words, \"didn't go too badly\".\n\n\"If it's harder there, it can go into a game and it gets a bit easier,\" Renshaw said. \"There's a wicket at the NCC in the indoor nets that turns a lot more, it's a bit less realistic than the Mumbai wickets at AB [Allan Border] Field. It's not the worst thing to practice on.\"\n\nRenshaw's lack of experience on the subcontinent can be seen as a negative, though the glass half full view is it means he does not bear the scars of previous failures.\n\n\"I think it helps that I've not been there. It's a challenge. I like to get up for challenges and to love the contest,\" he said.\n\nRenshaw said he would not be concerned if asked to field in close again despite suffering concussion after being hit on the helmet at short leg during the Sydney Test.\n\nThe injury resulted in him becoming the first player to be withdrawn from a Test under Cricket Australia's stringent concussion rules.\n\n\"If I have to do it in India I wouldn't be too mentally scarred from it. I'd be trying to get a couple of catches in there and win a series,\" Renshaw said. \"They [the doctors] just said I need to stop headbutting the ball.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrew Wu"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"India v Australia Test series: Matt Renshaw to consult Matthew Hayden for tips to play spin in India","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2500","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Wollongong","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Illawarra Mercury","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169699786","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"71"},"name":"Illawarra Mercury","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","Cricket"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.illawarramercury.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197396576","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:40:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Recognizing the need for action and growing budget shortfalls to address these important issues, the Iowa Legislature formed the Advisory Committee on Sustainable Natural Resource Funding in 2006 to recommend the best long-term, sustainable and predictable model to fund Iowa\u2019s natural resources.\n\nRepresentatives from the Iowa Farm Bureau, Iowa Association of County Conservation Boards, The Nature Conservancy, numerous other conservation, sportsmen and environmental groups, including Ducks Unlimited came together and reviewed over 40 sustainable funding models. I was one of the original 18 members chosen to serve on this bipartisan Advisory Committee. After a tremendous amount of research into the best practices for long term natural resources and outdoor recreation funding, the Advisory Committee recommended establishing a constitutionally protected trust to be funded by a 3/8 cent increase in the Iowa sales tax.\n\nIn November 2010, a 63 percent supermajority of Iowans voted to create the trust fund, yet Iowa lawmakers from both political parties have repeatedly failed to pass the sales tax increase to provide the funding. Six years after voters spoke loudly, the Natural Resources and Outdoor Recreation Trust Fund sits empty without a dime of funding. Had our state elected officials followed the will of the people and raised the sales tax back in 2010, nearly $1.0 billion in funding for natural resources and outdoor recreation would have been invested in shovel-ready projects across all 99 counties.\n\nConservation activities funded by the Trust will have a positive impact on local economies with increases in production, recreation, jobs, taxes and spending. These impacts have a multiplier effect and investment in our natural resources is important for the state\u2019s economy. Tourism generates more than $7.6 billion in Iowa, employs 64,600 people, and generates $328 million in state taxes.\n\nToday, roughly half of Iowa\u2019s rivers, lakes, and streams fail to meet minimum water quality standards. The lost sales tax revenue could have been used to improve water quality standards and likely avoid the divisive Des Moines Waterworks lawsuit. Today, less than 10 percent of Iowa\u2019s wetland areas remain. Wetland restoration would improve water quality, help with soil erosion, and provide important wildlife habitat critical to the $1.0 billion hunting and fishing industry in Iowa. The lost sales tax revenue could have been used to protect those wetlands. Iowa loses an average of 5 tons per acre of top soil annually to erosion. The lost funds could have been used to protect the precious soil which current and future generations of Iowa farmers will use to provide the food, fiber and fuel to meet global demand.\n\nIowans have consistently spoken loud and clear that they want action on funding the Iowa Outdoor Resources and Outdoor Recreation Trust Fund through a 3/8 increase in the statewide sales tax. Minnesota, Missouri and Arkansas have passed similar sales tax increases and the time has come to Fund the Trust in Iowa. As a conservative Republican voter, I strongly encourage Gov. Terry Branstad and the Iowa Legislature to secure our land and water legacy for future generations, leaving a truly lasting legacy.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Tammi Kircher"},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Guest view: Let\u2019s leave a lasting legacy","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Scott","zipCode":"52801","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Davenport","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"QC Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169762840","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1558"},"name":"QC Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.qctimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197399549","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/qctimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/95/c957908a-22bc-5d78-b357-30b35ef71595/5887a30879b03.image.jpg?crop=180%2C101%2C0%2C109&amp;resize=356%2C200&amp;order=crop%2Cresize"}],"video":[]}}

That means any number of conservative proposals that have spent the past two decades --- Republicans have not controlled all three legs of the state\u2019s lawmaking tripod since 1997 and 1998 --- are now ripe for passage. \n   \nLess than a month into the session, Republicans have introduced or said they plan to introduce legislation that would change the state\u2019s collective bargaining laws, stop all public funding to Planned Parenthood, divert funding from public schools to programs that allow parents to use state funding for private education, and loosen firearm regulations, among others. If passed, these bills will have little to no support from Democrats. \n   \nWe know Republican voters will like these bills and Democratic voters will not. Each bill is rooted in ideology that splits fairly evenly along party lines. \n   \nWhat will be more revealing is the reaction to any new policies by the state\u2019s less partisan voters --- no-party voters still outnumber registered Republicans and Democrats in Iowa. \n   \nThere are early signals that many people are not pleased with some of the proposals. When a committee meeting was held Tuesday to discuss a bill to defund Planned Parenthood, protestors overwhelmed the hearing room and the adjacent hallways and stairwells. That kind of crowd is rare for even the most controversial legislative proposals. \n   \nAnd that protest came on the heels of Saturday\u2019s \u201cWomen\u2019s March,\u201d which drew more than 20,000 people to the Iowa Capitol. \n   \nBut protests are one thing, and elections quite another. The real reaction to any new Iowa Republican policies will be measured in November 2018 at the ballot boxes. \n   \nWisconsin is a prime example. When the Badger State\u2019s Republicans won complete lawmaking control in the 2010 election, they immediately implemented dramatic changes to the state\u2019s collective bargaining laws, severely weakening unions\u2019 membership and influence. Protests overwhelmed the Wisconsin Capitol for months, with thousands flooding the building daily. Republicans also passed a bill requiring voters to show a photo ID at the poll, although that one wound up mired in the courts. \n   \nBut despite all those protests, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker survived a recall election and was re-elected in 2014, and the state legislature remains under Republican control. \n   \n Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox  \n   \nNot everyone is so lucky. \n   \nIn Kansas, Republican Gov. Sam Brownback shepherded dramatic income tax cuts, which he said would spur economic growth. That growth has not materialized, and Kansas\u2019 state budget is in disrepair, experiencing a shortfall of more than $900 million over 18 months, according to the Kansas City Star. \n   \nAnd in North Carolina, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory in November lost re-election after he approved and defended a law that directs people which bathroom to use. The law was heavily criticized by advocates for transgender individuals, and the NCAA moved all postseason events out of the state, including NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament games. \n   \nThose examples in other states show the thin line lawmakers walk when given unfettered authority, said multiple Iowa Republican leaders during the 1997 and 1998 legislative sessions. \n   \n\u201cYou have to guard against (doing too much), and that\u2019s kind of hard to do because, as I said, there\u2019s that pent-up energy,\u201d said Brent Siegrist, the House Majority Leader at the time. \u201cYou have people that may have some ideas that maybe are a little too far right or left, depending on who\u2019s in control. And you have to kind of manage that, too. ... \n   \n\u201cThat\u2019s a challenge, to kind of tamp down some of the more a-little-too-far-from-the-center ideas.\u201d \n   \nErin Murphy covers Iowa politics and state government for the Quad-City Times and other Lee Enterprises newspapers in Iowa.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 12 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Milwaukee","zipCode":"53201","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Milwaukee","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WISN Milwaukee","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169659888","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"504"},"name":"WISN Milwaukee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wisn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197405425","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nassau","zipCode":"11542","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Glen Cove","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Glen Cove Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169710816","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Glen Cove Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.glencove.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695197406021","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement.\n\n___\n\nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY\n\nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry.\n\n___\n\nFAIRFAX, VIRGINIA\n\nDozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia.\n\n___\n\nDENVER\n\nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order.\n\n___\n\nCHICAGO\n\nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations.\n\nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday.\n\nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported.\n\nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said.\n\nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours.\n\nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\"\n\n__\n\nDALLAS\n\nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released.\n\nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition.\n\nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released.\n\nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\"\n\nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said.\n\n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said.\n\nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke.\n\n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\"\n\nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come?\n\n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\"\n\n___\n\nSEATTLE\n\nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29.\n\n___\n\nPORTLAND, OREGON\n\nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\"\n\n___\n\nLOS ANGELES\n\nAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil.\n\nAvriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\n___\n\nSAN FRANCISCO\n\nHundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport's international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations.\n\n___\n\nSAN DIEGO\n\nAs motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"FOXNews.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169589579","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7648"},"name":"FOXNews.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","National","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.foxnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197409888","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:16:18Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://a57.foxnews.com/www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/images/2017/01/29/60/60/718ba5f98f434736996b3785e99ee961.jpg"},{"url":"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2017/01/29/protests-erupt-at-airports-following-trump-travel-ban/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1485674609346.jpg?ve=1"}],"video":[]}}

Episode VIII , the next film in the third trilogy, has been given an official title : The Last Jedi . The internet was immediately ablaze following the announcement. What does the title mean? And who is the last Jedi ? And what will he or she do? Amid all the chaos, though, something even more interesting has come to light in reference to the title. When you combine it with the name for Episode VII ( The Force Awakens ), the two titles actually make a complete sentence. Once you see it, you can't unsee it. And furthermore, if the theory behind it is true, everything could change. \n \nImage Source: Everett Collection , Disney \n \nAll this time, it seemed like Episode VII was making an entirely different statement: that the Force had been dormant for some time, and for some inexplicable reason \u2014 a ripple through the galaxy, perhaps \u2014 it had emerged from that state. If this theory is correct, though, it means two things. For one, maybe the Force was always awake, and in this trilogy, it is performing that very action and awakening the \"last Jedi.\" And second, if the first two installments of this trilogy are two parts of a sentence, then there's a strong chance Episode IX will complete it. \"The Force awakens the last Jedi\" . . . to defeat Supreme Leader Snoke ? To breed a whole new generation of powerful Jedi knights? These seem a little long for an Episode IX title, but hey, it's gotta be something along those lines. Sadly, we'll have to wait a while for the next installments ; The Last Jedi doesn't hit theaters until Dec. 15 of this year, and Episode IX isn't slated until 2019.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2443","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Laurieton","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Camden Haven Courier","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"348365251","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Camden Haven Courier","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.camdencourier.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197419219","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4558","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Maroochydore","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sunshine Coast Daily","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665159","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"29"},"name":"Sunshine Coast Daily","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au","publisher":"APN Holdings NZ Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197429042","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement.\n\n___\n\nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY\n\nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry.\n\n___\n\nFAIRFAX, VIRGINIA\n\nDozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia.\n\n___\n\nDENVER\n\nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order.\n\n___\n\nCHICAGO\n\nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations.\n\nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday.\n\nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported.\n\nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said.\n\nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours.\n\nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\"\n\n__\n\nDALLAS\n\nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released.\n\nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition.\n\nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released.\n\nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\"\n\nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said.\n\n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said.\n\nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke.\n\n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\"\n\nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come?\n\n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\"\n\n___\n\nSEATTLE\n\nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29.\n\n___\n\nPORTLAND, OREGON\n\nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\"\n\n___\n\nLOS ANGELES\n\nAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil.\n\nAvriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\n___\n\nSAN FRANCISCO\n\nHundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport's international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations.\n\n___\n\nSAN DIEGO\n\nAs motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Montgomery","zipCode":"45420","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dayton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WHIO.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"568194704","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"38"},"name":"WHIO.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.whio.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197430178","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.whio.com/rf/image/Wires/w2/AP_Top_News_US_Stories/2017/01/29/Images/718ba5f98f434736996b3785e99ee961.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Letaba Rest Camp \n \nLetaba Rest Camp is situated on the bend of the Letaba River. The camp is midway between the southern and northern boundaries, reports the . \n \nThe name means \u201criver of sand\u201d. The riverbed is an excellent location for game viewing, particularly elephant. \n \n\n \n2. Orpen Rest Camp \n \nOrpen Rest Camp is situated on the western border of the KNP. It derived its name from the surname of the donor of the land, Eileen Orpen. \n \nIt is an area of scattered trees and wide-open plains populated by the three big cats. You can also look forward to encounters with wild dog. \n \n3. Talamati Bushveld Camp \n \nTalamati Bushveld Camp is situated in a large open valley. Talamati is a Xitsonga word that means \u201clots of water\u201d. \n \nDespite the meaning of the name, the river is actually dry. The clay soil acts as a giant sponge holding a vast reservoir of underground water. The vegetation there is lush all year round and attracts grazers. \n \n4. Sirheni Bushveld Camp \n \nSirheni Bushveld Camp nestles on the edge of the KNP\u2019s northern plains. \n \nThe Mphongolo River flows close by. Sirheni is a Tsonga word that means \u201ccemetery\u201d. There is an elephant graveyard at a site near to the camp. From the camp\u2019s bird hides a wide variety of game and birds can be watched. \n \n\n \n5. Skukuza \n \nSkukuza is a Shangaan word meaning either \u201che who sweeps clean\u201d or \u201che who turns everything upside down\u201d.

Punda Maria \n \nThe name of the Punda Maria rest camp was given in 1919 by the first ranger to be posted to the area, Captain JJ Coetser. \n \nHe mistakenly named his post Punda Maria in the belief that this was the Swahili name for zebra, the first big game he saw on arrival. \n \nThe correct Swahili name is actually \u201cpunda milia\u201d or striped donkey. When the error was pointed out to him, he chose to retain the name, in honour of his wife, Maria. \n \nDr. Salomon Joubert said that in 1959, the Parks Board changed the name to Punda Miliya. \n \nDr. Van Warmelo, a well-known ethnomologist, said that the name should be spelt Punda Milia and the board accepted that. \n \nIn 1981 Dr. Tol Pienaar did a submission to the board and two acquaintances of Coetzer Hewit Ivy and Astley Maberley said that this is the correct version of how it came about. \n \nThe board accepted the explanation and the name was restored in 1981. \n \n\n \n\u2013  Caxton News Service \n \nRead original story on","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"This is how these six Kruger camps got their names","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Northglen News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"533460279","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Northglen News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://northglennews.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197430695","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official.

The fuel is often hauled up the Richardson Highway from Valdez, in trucks pulling double tankers often bound to support drilling and other industrial operations on the North Slope oil fields. Regulators have said trucking companies are taking steps to reduce the number of accidents. \n \nTuesday's rollover came after a Big State Logistics truck lost traction at the Keystone Canyon, at Mile 17.5 of the highway. The second fuel tank briefly slid off the road. The truck driver took corrective action to bring it under control, forcing that so-called pup tank to roll onto the highway and leak, according to a report from the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. \n \nThe accident shut down the highway for about 1 hours, starting about 1:45 p.m., a Valdez official said. About 30 gallons of diesel leaked, but did not leave the road. No injuries were reported, and the truck and main tank were not damaged.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Second tanker in recent days rolls and leaks diesel fuel","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dillingham","zipCode":"99576","state":"Alaska","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dillingham","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bristol Bay Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169718633","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Bristol Bay Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thebristolbaytimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197435206","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 13 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Baltimore City","zipCode":"21211","state":"Maryland","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Baltimore","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WBAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659774","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"477"},"name":"WBAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wbaltv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197440946","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Understood correctly, there are lessons in these readings for both the secular world and the world of faith. \n \nMost sermons this week surely will focus on the famous \u201cbeatitudes,\u201d Jesus\u2019 \u201cSermon on the Mount\u201d in which he laid out his central teachings for how we should understand God\u2019s mercy. We are told, of course, that \u201cblessed are the meek,\u201d the \u201cmerciful,\u201d the \u201cpure in heart,\u201d the \u201cpeacemakers,\u201d and so on through the familiar litany. \n \nIn a much pithier way, a single Old Testament verse from Micah (also in today\u2019s readings) rather well encompasses the same entire message of the Beatitudes: The Lord requires us \u201cto do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.\u201d (Indeed, if one wants to sum up the entire Bible in just three very short passages, one could probably just cite that Micah verse, and Christ\u2019s two great commandments in Matthew 22:38-39 to love our neighbor and our God, and John 3:16 about God giving his one and only son so that we may have eternal life.) \n \nYet, while the Beatitudes and the verse from Micah justly command attention (and each could and should inspire numerous, learned, lengthy essays and sermons), one would be remiss in not also pondering the two other readings. Psalm 15 tells us that to dwell on God\u2019s holy hill we should \u201cwalk blamelessly, and do what is right, and speak the truth from [our] heart\u2026 and stand by [our] oath even to [our] hurt.\u201d And Corinthians tells us that all \u201cthe wisdom of the world\u201d is mere foolishness in comparison with the wisdom of God. It goes further still, emphasizing St. Paul\u2019s favorite theme that we are incapable of achieving salvation through our own wisdom and efforts alone \u2013 and that therefore God saves us not specifically because we always do the right thing (because none of us ever does the right thing every time) but instead \u201cto save those who believe.\u201d \n \nAll of which leads to what appears a contradiction: We are told again and again to do good, act wisely, be humble, be generous, etcetera, but then appear to be told (at first glance) that none of this really matters because salvation comes from belief, from faith, alone. \n \nThis is not the place to review the entire \u201cworks versus faith\u201d debate, the centuries of discord that it entailed, or the growing realization that faith and works aren\u2019t exclusive of each other but instead can work in harmony with each other. Instead, what is important when considering these readings together is not that one or another path leads to salvation, but that Scripture taken as a whole outlines different prescriptions and different standards for different situations and different realms.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"What the Supreme Court Owes to the Supreme Being","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Pajamas Media","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169767566","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"366"},"name":"Pajamas Media","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pajamasmedia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=16","https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah+6:8","http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-39.htm","https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203:16","http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_31101999_cath-luth-joint-declaration_en.html"],"sequenceId":"695197441814","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T11:54:47Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Nevermore will Americans go wanting, because the perfect dessert formula has been discovered. \n\nNot so in Canada. We still have real people fretting over real dessert menus, fruitlessly searching for the Holy Grail of first-date desserts. These hopeless lovers need a hand, so why not try some kind of cheesecake? There is plenty of variety so you'll never run out of fresh desserts on all those first dates you'll be having. \n\nThere is, of course, one big glaring problem suggesting a cheesecake to someone you've only really had about 75 minutes to get to know. At first glance it may seem risky suggesting a dessert that could potentially harm someone who requires a lactose-free snack. Luckily there are vegan cheesecakes, completely void of dairy, so hopefully one of these is on the menu. \n\nMany cheesecakes are incredibly rich, so it balances out nicely with a post-dinner coffee, assuming you drink your coffee without tainting it with cream or sugar. There is enough cream and sugar in the cheesecake. \n\nAlso, according to the Food Network, cheesecake is a classic dessert served to athletes in the first Olympic Games. Not the first modern Games, but the ancient Games, back in 776 B.C. If it's good enough for Olympians, it must be a great choice for a first date. \n\nThey even point out that it's considered bad luck by somebody, somewhere to serve cheesecake at weddings, so using it as a first date taste test is a great way to say, \"Let's see where this goes, but let's not get carried away here.\" \n\nShe said \n\nIn the U.S., the first-date dessert is frozen yogurt, according to a study I read somewhere online a while ago. Having recently been introduced to Tutti Frutti Frozen Yogurt, I fully understand the charm. It's delicious, comes in a variety of flavours and offers a buffet of suitable and unsuitable toppings. For example, last Monday when I was watching The Bachelor on TV (I'm in love), I was noshing on a yogurt combo of chocolate and salted caramel, topped with brownie chunks, toasted coconut, butterscotch and chocolate sauce. \n\nIt was fantastic, and somehow made up for Sean's decision to send home Leslie M. \n\nHere in Canada, while we do love our frozen treats, I think there's one dessert-like national treasure that has captured the nation. This is especially true in Estevan, where this is actually one of the few avenues open for a casual first date: Tim Hortons. I know, coffee isn't a dessert, but a doughnut, muffin or box of TimBits definitely qualifies. \n\nConsider: you're picking up a girl from math class to go watch a hockey game together. You've texted non-stop for more than two weeks, so you know it's definitely serious. Before the game, you grab a coffee/tea for each of you and sit together using the cups to keep your hands warm because you're too scared to reach over and hold her hand. \n\nAfter the hockey game, it's only 9 p.m. Mom and Dad said you didn't have to be home until 11 p.m. Your friends are heading home, but that's all right, because you two are going to find something to do. \n\nTim Hortons for another beverage? Hollywood has told you that coffee shops are the perfect date setting; plus, you aren't old enough to go to the bar. Coffee it is, and this time you both grab a doughnut, so there's a reason to spend even more time out together. \n\nMan, I should write commercials for Tim Hortons, Canada's first-date dessert centre. \n\nAlso, 11 p.m. is an unreasonable curfew.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Canada news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"What is Canada's first-date dessert?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"S4A","state":"Saskatchewan","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Estevan","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Estevan Mercury","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169661372","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Estevan Mercury","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.estevanmercury.ca"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197446152","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Sorry, but remember last year, when you didn't show up? It was the first recorded winter in Fairbanks when the thermometer at the airport didn't register minus 30 Fahrenheit. I didn't know what to think. \n \nBut here you are, a blob straight from the North Pole, squatting over middle Alaska. No records, but some impressive, dimly remembered numbers. Minus 56 at Tanana. Minus 51 right now at Fairbanks International. \n \nFrom my perch here on the university hill, I can't see the airport. All of Fairbanks has disappeared in a fuzz of white. Remember when Carl Benson drove around town collecting particles of ice fog on plastic sheets, scraping them into a vial with a hard spatula? He wrote a classic paper on the phenomenon that happens at minus 30 or colder, when the air can't hold any more moisture. Exhaust floats behind tailpipes, as if every driver is skywriting. Please! Just keep running till we get there! \n \nBut that was back in 1970, when you oozed into dark valleys and owned the city streets. After last winter, and all that talk about tipping points and vanished sea ice and absurdly high global temperatures, I really wondered if I'd see you again. \n \nBut here you are, back in Fairbanks, far from the dulling effects of the (relatively) warm ocean. There's no buffer between us and the Neptune-like top of the winter world but a mountain range, skimpy boreal forest and tundra plants covered with snow. And in you came. \n \nYou remember Ed Plumb? He's a meteorologist so fond of you he once traveled to the Pole of Cold in Siberia, a village called Oymyakon. In the darkness this morning, he posted to Instagram what we used to call a self-portrait. Only his eyes are visible amid a crumbly armor of frost pasted to his hat and neck gator. You made him wear his former breaths. \n \nHe skied to work this morning through the UAF Cold Preserve and noted the temperature there was minus 53 F. I gave that spot its name because it's all tussock tundra and broomstick black spruce, and some scientists have installed a tower with thermometers on it you can check online. http://monitors.iarc.uaf.edu/uaf-north-campus/ \n \nBecause I haven't experienced your sting for so long, and was so happy you weren't dead, I followed Ed's lead. I decided to ski the two miles from home to my office at the university. \n \nWhile I was dressing, my new weather station at home registered minus 41, the lowest number it has experienced. But not the lowest I have felt. You remember 1989, right? Minus 56 that January, when my dog's water dish froze to the floor inside the cabin and the ringer on my phone stopped working, prompting Mom to call the Red Cross. \n \nYour appearance now, thank you very much, is a new cold record for both my daughter (10 years old) and my dog (2 years old). But now that I've got water pipes to thaw, I have mixed feelings about you dropping in. \n \nSure, there's an initial excitement, the spark that drew me to you in the first place. Reminds me of when that black-fly studying scientist mentioned his streamside epiphany, when he realized why no humans lived in his study areas in Siberia and northern Alaska: Biting flies and extreme cold. You have kept the traffic light and the trails quiet. Thanks for that. \n \nLike the rest of them, though, I am a tropical creature. I depend on the human ingenuity of fiberglass insulation and puffy clothing to make life possible. A two-mile trip on cross-country skis is an adventure, because you turn unprotected flesh to stone. \n \nAs I stepped outside to ski, I noticed one of your endearing features, the channeling of sound waves between the temperature-inversion ceiling and the floor of new snow. A train blowing its horn a few miles away seemed to be barreling down the ski trail. Even the squeaky grind of its steel wheels were audible through the dense air. \n \nThe snow was squawking too. You made the bond between snow crystals so rigid, they squeaked when stepped upon. Not only that, you robbed the substance of its fun. Skiing was like walking \u2014 no glide whatsoever. You stole all the heat two skis generated, not allowing meltwater to form between ski base and snow. \n \nHowever, despite your reappearance in the local woods, chickadees peeped and whistled. As did pine grosbeaks, redpolls and the oblivious ravens. All of these creatures fluffed their feathers against you and somehow had survived the night shivering on a branch. \n \nThose birds have the ability to migrate away from here but chose not to. I just tried avoidance strategy, leaving Alaska for weeks. I came back and ran right into you. \n \nDon't get me wrong, I like you and all, but you burned my fingers when I touched my skis after bringing them inside. And they're made of plastic! \n \nTrue, I don't have much of a case. I have chosen to live where you often reside. It is the coldest part of the coldest month. And quite close to Alaska's coldest day: January 23, 1971. That's when Prospect Creek reached 80 below (it's also Ed Plumb's birthday, no coincidence there). \n \nAnd hey, it's nostalgic to see you again, even though you make the car sputter before it starts even though it's plugged in and you eat so much of our firewood. \n \nDeep down, I really kind of like you.

Of all the fine things we have access to, a good night\u2019s sleep is still the most personal, and one that calls for a personalised solution. \n \n\n \nThe Hall Collection stocks some of the great mattresses from ELITE. Here their benefits: \n \nThe Master \n \nExceptionally soft, comfortable, and supportive, this mattress is composed of a 5-layer body of pocket springs. Providing simultaneous softness and support, the core is composed of a system of anatomical zones adapted to the form of the sleeper\u2019s body. The next two layers are used to eliminate all the pressure exerted on the body by gravity. The Maestro is unique: assembled entirely by hand, it is stuffed with absolutely extraordinary 100% natural padding. \n \n\n \nFlamenco \n \nThe unique \u201cDuoflex\u201d suspension ensures exceptional comfort and softness. The pocket springs progressively compress for dynamic, localised support for the spinal column and the lumber area. The 7 comfort zones allow relief of excessive pressure on the sensitive zones of the body such as the nape of the neck, the cervical vertebrae, the shoulders, and, of course, the hips. The layers shown on the right ensure perfect thermo-regulation while absorbing moisture and odors and offering incomparable coziness. \n \n\n \nCrescendo \n \nFeaturing just the right blend of softness and support, this model is distinguished by progressive anatomical adjustment and good sleep independence for couples, meaning that one person is not disturbed if the other person moves or rolls over. This time-tested technique makes it possible to achieve what Elite call a work of art. \n \n\n \nVilla \n \nWith its core of independent pocket springs, this mattress offers exceptional comfort that is both soft and firm. Its design guarantees a high degree of sleep independence and it is particularly well suited to larger people. It features sheep\u2019s wool and Tussah silk. Thanks to the reinforced edges, the mattress does not lose its original shape over time. \n \n\n \nThe post appeared first on SA Décor & Design Blog .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"SA Decor"},"topics":[],"title":"The Hall Collection: Elite Mattresses","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"South African Décor and Design","feed":{"genre":"Blog","tags":[],"id":"514921191","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"South African Décor and Design","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle","Home"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sadecor.co.za/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SaDcorDesignBlog?a=0q09xTVIeN4:7OEBimegHcw:qj6IDK7rITs"],"sequenceId":"695197449908","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:46Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.sadecor.co.za/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/crescendo1.jpg"},{"url":"http://www.sadecor.co.za/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/elitebeds-manufacture-610x223.jpg"},{"url":"http://www.sadecor.co.za/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/6villa-img.jpg"},{"url":"http://www.sadecor.co.za/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/flamenco-img.jpg"},{"url":"http://www.sadecor.co.za/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/maestro22.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

(Photo by AFP) \n \nUS President Donald Trump has signed yet another executive order directing the military\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff to devise a plan within 30 days to destroy the Daesh (ISIL) terrorist group. \n \nTrump signed the military directive on Saturday, along with two other executive orders, including one imposing restrictions on highly lucrative lobbying for foreign governments by administration officials. \n \nIn remarks following the order to military commanders, Trump said, \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very successful. That\u2019s big stuff.\u201d \n \nThe move was apparently aimed to signal that the new US president was serious about delivering on his campaign pledge to tackle \u201cglobal terrorism\u201d more aggressively than his Democratic predecessor, former President Barack Obama, whom he has accused of establishing the notorious terror group that has taken over large swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria and engaged in exporting their oil reserves. \n \nThis is while both Trump and his defense secretary, retired Marine General James Mattis, have expressed a desire to expedite an end to the battle against ISIL. US military advisers and air power have reportedly been engaged in helping Iraqi forces in recapturing the city of Mosul. In Syria, the US is struggling to recruit enough local militants to facilitate its own plan to recapture ISIL stronghold of Raqqah, in continued efforts to undermine the authority of the Syrian government. \n \nEven before Saturday\u2019s order, US military authorities had been at work developing a series of potential actions for Mattis and Trump\u2019s entire national security team to consider, according to The Washington Post , which added that the plans include possible deployment of additional advisers to Iraq and Syria. \n \nChanges to the existing campaign are expected to be modest adjustments to the existing strategy rather than any radical departure. How far the new measures go \u201cwould depend upon the political risk that the president is willing to take when we do certain things that could exacerbate things with Russia or Turkey.\" \n \nThe proposals will seek to make sure that commanders in the field \u201chave the wherewithal and the leeway to do what they have to do to successfully prosecute the campaign,\u201d the report added, citing a US defense official speaking on condition of anonymity. \n \nDeployment of more combat power, however, may come with serious drawbacks, including risking additional American lives and adding to the already significant cost of military operations overseas. \n \nThe daily further added that Trump also signed an executive order restructuring the National Security Council \u201cand streamlining procedures in a way that the White House believes would be more adaptive to modern threats.\u201d \n \nIt also quoted Trump as saying that the change would bring \u201ca lot of efficiency and, I think, a lot of additional safety,\u201d adding: \u201cPeople have talked about doing this for a long time.\" \n \nHowever, it was not immediately clear on Saturday what impact Trump\u2019s executive order halting entry of migrants and legal US residents from Iraq and other Muslim-majority nations would have on Washington\u2019s partnership with the Iraqi government in the battle against ISIL. Iraqi lawmakers have urged the country\u2019s Foreign Ministry to explain how the measure will affect Iraq. \n \nDaesh terrorists, who were initially trained by the CIA in Jordan in 2012 to destabilize the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, now control large parts of Syria and Iraq. They have been engaged in crimes against humanity in the areas under their control.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Trump wants ISIL defeat plan in 30 days 4hr","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IR","country":"Iran"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"PressTV.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552639271","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1225"},"name":"PressTV.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://presstv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197450273","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 13 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Polk","zipCode":"50309","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Des Moines","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KCCI","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659157","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1116"},"name":"KCCI","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kcci.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197452347","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

drugs have risen sharply in the past five years, restricting their use in treating NHS patients, research from the European Cancer Congress has found. \n \nDrugs such as tamoxifen and bulsufan are now 10 times more expensive despite no longer being under patent. \n \nThe British Generic Manufacturers Association said trusts often paid much less than the list price. \n \nIt said the NHS had benefited from competition over generic drugs. \n \nBut the UK researchers said NHS negotiations with drug companies were failing to contain costs, and getting access to cheaper drugs would allow more people to be treated with more modern medicines. \n \nThey estimated that the cost of these price rises to the NHS in England was around £380m a year \u2013 which only included community-based prescribing, not hospital prescribing. \n Rationing  \nDrugs start off being on-patent, and their high prices allow pharmaceutical companies to profit from their investments in research and development. \n \nAfter patents have expired and generic versions are sold, the theory is that drug prices should fall close to the cost of production. \n \nHowever, because of high drug prices, the NHS is often not able to approve some new cancer drugs for use. \n \nNew treatments then have to be rationed. \n \nDr Andrew Hill, senior research fellow in pharmacology and therapeutics at the University of Liverpool, and Melissa Barber from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, collected prices on medicines available on the NHS for their presentation at the cancer conference. \n \nThey discovered that busulfan, which is used to treat leukaemia, cost 21p per tablet in 2011 and £2.61 in 2016. \n \nTamoxifen, used to treat breast cancer, cost 10p per tablet in 2011 and £1.21 in 2016. \n \nOf 89 cancer medicines looked at in the analysis, 21 showed price rises from 2011 to 2016 \u2013 with 17 of those classified as generic. \n \nFourteen generic cancer drugs showed price rises of more than 100%. \n \nAnd compared with prices for the same drugs in India, the UK drugs were roughly 20 times more expensive. \n \u2018Worrying\u2019  \nDr Hill said he was surprised to find several companies had consistently raised the prices of cancer treatment. \n \n\u201cWe have found that some companies take over the supply of some generic cancer medicines and then raise the price progressively,\u201d he said. \n \nHe said this was \u201cworrying\u201d, particularly when the Cancer Drugs Fund is under pressure from high prices. \n \nBut Warwick Smith, director-general of the British Generic Manufacturers Association, said the actual prices paid by hospitals were usually much lower than the list prices. \n \nHe said the tendered price paid by hospitals for tamoxifen 10mg tablets is £4.85 for a pack of 30, or 16p per tablet. \n \u2018Significant savings\u2019  \n\u201cGeneric competition in the oncology market has produced very significant savings for the NHS and generated access for patients to medicines such as tamoxifen which can be used to reduce the risk of breast cancer and not just to treat it. \n \n\u201cIn the case of generic medicines used in hospitals, it is important to distinguish between the actual price paid by trusts and the much higher list prices often quoted.\u201d \n \nThe Health Services Medical Supplies (Costs) Bill, currently going through Parliament, is designed to allow the NHS to regulate prices in the future. \n \nAs a result of the bill, companies found to be raising prices with no clear justification will be referred to the Competition and Markets Authority, and could face fines. \n \nThere is a similar situation in other European countries. \n \nIn Spain and Italy, failure to accept the high prices demanded for some generic treatments has led to warnings from companies that they could stop their supply. \n \n\u201cAt a time when cancer patients are living longer and better lives due to effective treatments, this situation is particularly worrying,\u201d Dr Hill said. \n \nRead More At:   Article Source \n \nThe post appeared first on RocketNews |Top News Stories From Around the Globe

If we get 1 on 1, I\u2019m going your way so you\u2019d better win,\u201d\u2019 Webb said. \u201cAnd he did. He won multiple times.\u201d \n \nWebb spread the ball around to other receivers like Mississippi State\u2019s Fred Ross as well. The Pac-12 Conference\u2019s leading passer directed scoring drives on all three of his possessions while completing 11 of 16 passes for 165 yards, including a 39-yard touchdown strike on a well-thrown fade to Reynolds. Reynolds had six catches for 96 yards, most of them on that first drive with Webb. \n \nNate Peterman of Pittsburgh had a similarly strong passing performance for the North in the showcase game for senior NFL prospects that actually featured late drama. Peterman fired a 6-yard scoring pass to East Carolina\u2019s Zay Jones with 1:51 left but the North went for two points and a potential lead. \n \nUnder heavy pressure from Chattanooga\u2019s Keionta Davis, Peterman\u2019s pass was deflected and intercepted by BYU\u2019s Harvey Langi.

We didn\u2019t get it but it was a great experience still.\u201d \n \nWebb was the game\u2019s overall MVP after passing for 4,295 yards and 37 touchdowns last season as a graduate transfer from Texas Tech. \n \nHe led the South to a touchdown and field goal in the final three minutes of the first half. He and Reynolds proved a prolific combination on the touchdown drive, moving downfield on connections of 21 \u2014 on a third-and-10 play \u2014 and 13 yards before the touchdown. \n \nGame rules require teams to go for two points in the second quarter, and the South\u2019s attempt failed to keep the halftime lead at 9-3. \n \n \nToledo running back Kareem Hunt ran for 118 yards on 15 carries to earn North Outstanding Player Honors, including a 20-yarder and a 43-yarder on back-to-back plays. \n \nThe South\u2019s honoree was Kansas State defensive end Jordan Willis, who forced two fumbles and had a pair of sacks. \n \nThe South committed five turnovers and turned it over on its first three possessions.

Drew covered quite a bit of ground running R code that showed how to make use of WinBugs, JAGS and Stan, the major engines for specifying and solving Bayesian models. With this very helpful introduction to Bayesian thinking fresh in my mind I thought that it would be worth a look at how well R and computational Bayesian statistics are getting along. After all, they practically grew up together. The modern era of Bayesian computation began with the \u201crediscovery\u201d of MCMC algorithms in the early 1990s, and R became an open source project in 1995. The logical place to start, the CRAN Task View for Bayesian Inference, states that: Applied researchers interested in Bayesian statistics are increasingly attracted to R because of the ease of which one can code algorithms to sample from posterior distributions as well as the significant number of packages contributed to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) that provide tools for Bayesian inference. My bet is that the reason that Bayesian task view lists 7 packages for general model fitting and over 80 packages for for specific Bayesian models and methods is because there are quite a few Bayesian statisticians are working in R with only a relatively small number are submitting packages to CRAN. However, even with all of this custom Bayesian coding it is probably safe to say that in the much of the computational heavy lifting for Bayesian analysis is accomplished through specialized Bayesian engines for which Drew provided examples.  WinBUGS is a version of the original BUGS (Bayesian Inference Using Gibbs Sampling) that began as a project  MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge in 1989. WinBUGS is free, stable software that may be accessed via the R2WinBUGS R package. Although WinBUGS still sees quite a bit of use, all of the BUGS development these days is centered around the open source (GPL2) OpenBUGS software that runs on Unix and Linux in addition to Windows. The R2OpenBUGS package provides access to OpenBugs in a similar way that R2WinBUGS interfaces to WinBUGS. The BRugs package provides tighter integration to OpenBUGS. Its interactive interface allows for completing some housekeeping tasks such as checking convergence without having to exit the BUGS software. JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) is a Bayesian engine that was designed to work with R. It is open source (GPL 2) runs on multiple operating systems, is extensible and allows users to write their own functions. The language JAGS uses to specify Bayesian models is a variation of the basic BUGS language. R users access JAGS through the rjags package and may used the coda package to analyze the MCMC results. The newest Bayesian engine, Stan (named after Stanislaw Ulam of Monte Carlo fame), is a open source software (GPL 3) that was designe to be faster and handle hierarchical models that are out of reach for both OpenBugs and JAGS. Stan runs on various versions of Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.  According to the Stan manual: \u201cA Stan program is first compiled to a C++ program by the Stan compiler stanc, then the C++ program compiled to a self-contained platform-specific executable.\u201d Stan\u2019s language for expressing the Bayesian models and its method computing posteriors (No-U-Turn sampler, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) are also different from the BUGS. R users access Stan through the RStan package. If you are new to Bayesian Computing Drew\u2019s sample code is a good place to start.

Trump and his team insisted the order was not intended to target Islam and its followers, but the hashtag #muslimban trended, and many Muslims both in America and abroad said they viewed the measure as a broadly conceived and stinging exclusion. \n\nCapping a day of high-stakes drama, a federal judge in New York, Ann M. Donnelly, ordered a halt to deportations of travelers who arrived at airports with valid visas to enter the U.S., saying that sending them back to the affected countries could cause them \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d But she did not rule on the legality of the executive order, nor did she say that others who have not yet arrived in the U.S. can be allowed to proceed. \n\nOpponents of the president\u2019s directive vowed to seek a wider court win. Lawyers from groups including the American Civil Liberties Union said they intended to press ahead with efforts to overturn the president\u2019s overall order on constitutional grounds. And they rejoiced at their early victory. \n\n\u201cClearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country,\u201d said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero. \u201cOn week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n\nIn a separate and more limited ruling, a federal judge in Virginia ordered a weeklong stay against removing people with permanent U.S. residency who had been detained under the presidential order at Washington Dulles International Airport. \n\nAs the directive\u2019s effects spread, thousands staged spontaneous protests against refugee detention at airports across the country, including in Los Angeles and San Francisco. At New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, demonstrators waved signs and read from the famous Emma Lazarus poem inscribed in the Statue of Liberty. \n\nAt more than a dozen airports, including Los Angeles, Newark, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and Atlanta, immigration attorneys stepped up in droves to offer free services to those detained. \u201cA lot of tears and emotion here,\u201d said Hassan Ahmad, a lawyer from northern Virginia who hustled to Dulles airport. \n\nThe New York order appeared to affect the 100 to 200 people who were detained in transit to the United States. While the order will prevent them from being sent home, it was less clear whether they will have to remain in detention while their asylum cases are being decided. \n\nOne of the two detained Iraqis named in the case, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was an interpreter who had worked on behalf of the U.S. government. Freed after 19 hours in custody, he wept as he spoke to reporters, thanking supporters and calling America \u201cthe land of freedom, the land of rights.\u201d \n\nThe groups bringing the legal challenge, who also included the International Refugee Assistance Project and the National Immigration Law Center, said a separate motion sets the stage for a larger action involving other would-be refugees, visitors and immigrants stopped at other ports of entry. \n\nArab American advocacy groups also were reacting to the new order, warning that it was disrupting travel all over the world. \n\n\u201cWe see complete chaos in the way this has been implemented,\u201d Abed A. Ayoub, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said in a conference call with reporters. \n\nThe directive, he said, had caught up not only desperate refugees who had thought themselves within a hairsbreadth of safety, but many more with already established lives, homes and families in the United States. \u201cThis order needs to be rescinded,\u201d he said. \n\nIn another legal challenge, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would file a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. The suit, to be filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Virginia, argues that the executive order is unconstitutional because of its apparent aim of singling out Muslims. \n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that refugees \u2014 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2014 are a threat to national security,\u201d the group\u2019s national litigation director, Lena F. Masri, said in a statement. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d \n\nThe order, signed Friday by Trump during a visit to the Pentagon, suspends all refugee entries for 120 days. In addition, it indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees and bars entry to the U.S. for 90 days for those traveling from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n\nProminent Muslim figures raised their voices in opposition to the temporary refugee ban, saying children would be among those suffering the most from it. \n\nNobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by the Taliban, said in a statement that she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d that Trump was closing the door on \u201cchildren, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war.\u201d \n\nOn Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said the travel ban also covered holders of green cards, who are authorized to live and work in the U.S. Some reports have put the number of such permanent residents from the affected countries as high as half a million. \n\nAn administration official said that current green card holders from the affected countries would be allowed to remain in the U.S. \u2014 but that those caught outside the country at the time of the ban\u2019s imposition would have to be allowed back in on a case-by-case basis. Those with business overseas will have to meet beforehand with a consular official. \n\nThe measure\u2019s scope was also widened by a State Department announcement that dual nationals from the seven affected countries who also held passports from third countries such as Britain or Canada could be blocked \u2014 in effect denying U.S. entry to citizens of closely allied nations.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Laura King"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: movie news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Trump's ban on some U.S. entries sparks confusion and protest worldwide, and legal rebukes at home","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"91011","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"La Canada Flintridge","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lacanada Online News","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169788181","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Lacanada Online News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts","Film"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lacanadaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197464091","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:35:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d99bc/turbine/la-na-pol-refugee-policy-20170128/600"}],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million.

The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2400","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Moree","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Moree Champion","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"348381972","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Moree Champion","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.moreechampion.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197464724","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n\nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n\n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n\n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n\nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n\n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n\n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n\n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n\n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n\nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n\n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n\n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n\n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4305","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"West Ipswich","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Queensland Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668239","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"12"},"name":"Queensland Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.qt.com.au","publisher":"APN Holdings NZ Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197466640","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557687z1_20170129162619_000g9dg4eu82-0-5o7dbx25uooe6wninn2_ct300x300.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Seven days later, norms and doctrine that have guided the United States for decades are being re-examined. \n\nTrump\u2019s down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address: a call to arms that tested old distinctions between left and right. \n\n\u201cToday, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cWe are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.\u201d \n\nThe establishment \u201celites\u201d in big cities, in politics and the media were no longer the technocrats in charge of the world\u2019s only superpower, they were the enemy. \n\nThe new president also put the rest of the world on notice. \n\nFor the last 75 years, America had been what Barack Obama described as the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d \u2014 the glue that bound the global order. \n\nThe era of Trump would be the era of \u201cAmerica first,\u201d he said, of naked self-interest and zero-sum diplomacy. Old alliances would be reassessed, new alliances would be explored. \n\nBefore his inauguration, many asked if the presidency would change Donald Trump, or whether Donald Trump would change the presidency. \n\nBarely 20 minutes into his four-year term, anyone who was listening had their answer. \n\n\u2013 Rolling thunder \u2013 \n\nBefore arriving at the Oval Office, Trump\u2019s strategists had decided to use the first few weeks to unleash a daily wave of executive orders. \n\nThe aim was to unbalance opponents, define Trump as a man of action and slake his supporters\u2019 thirst for change. \n\nFor much of middle America, globalization, automation and the Great Recession had been apocalyptic. \n\nPolitics had passed them over and worse, they felt steamrollered by \u201ccoastal elites\u201d in America\u2019s \u201cculture wars\u201d over abortion, gay rights, immigration, global warming and religion. \n\nTrump had won the election by promising to be their champion, and he was going to \u2014 as Ronald Reagan said \u2014 \u201cdance with the one that brung ya.\u201d \n\nFor the most part, the CEO-in-chief put forward actions that could have come from any Republican in the country: defunding abortion, preening the military and approving oil pipelines. \n\nBut it was coated with a thick veneer of nationalist and populist rhetoric, and accompanying policies championed by top aide Steve Bannon. \n\nTrump ripped up a trans-Pacific trade deal designed to counterbalance China\u2019s regional economic power, imposed a ban on refugees from Syria and migrants from seven other Muslim countries. \n\nHe ordered planning to begin to build a wall on Mexico\u2019s southern border and picked a very public fight with Mexico\u2019s president Enrique Pena Nieto, who cancelled a trip to Washington. \n\nThe United States, a nation founded by migrants, was now willing to shut its doors. \n\nNot since Obama\u2019s election or perhaps the Iraq War has America\u2019s image around the world changed so dramatically and so quickly. \n\nBut Trump supporters saw an outsider sticking up for them and sticking it to the elites. \n\n\u201cGet used to it,\u201d said Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, boasting that Trump had delivered a \u201cshock to the system.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s just getting started,\u201d she said. \n\n\u2013 Rocky start \u2013 \n\nBut it was not all positive for Trump. The White House is far from purring. Key positions have yet to be filled and the decision making process is haphazard. \n\nTrump aides were forced to publicly row back suggestions of a 20 percent border tax on Mexican goods and defend a chaotic rollout of the refugee and migrant ban. \n\nThroughout the week, Trump engaged in intemperate outbursts about the size of his inaugural crowd, alleged election fraud and perceived media persecution. \n\nPrivately, in call after call, he complained to top aides about press coverage. The impression was of a man focused on his image more than running the country. \n\nTrump also seemed like a a man for whom becoming US president was not adulation enough. \n\nSpokesman Sean Spicer \u2014 between tirades and missteps \u2014 offered a window onto the soul of the White House. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this constant theme to undercut the enormous support he has,\u201d Spicer said. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably frustrating when you\u2019re continually told it\u2019s not big enough; it\u2019s not good enough. You can\u2019t win.\u201d \n\nBut critics saw a more sinister motive for the outbursts, particularly Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that three million people voted illegally in the election. \n\nBrian Klaas, an expert on global democracy at the London School of Economics, sees Trump \u201ccasting aspersions (without evidence) on electoral integrity is a key way to restrict voting rights and erode confidence in elections.\u201d \n\n\u201cAttacking the media and blurring the lines of truth with state narratives not grounded in fact is important to sowing public doubt,\u201d he said. \n\nMindy Finn, who ran as a independent vice presidential candidate, summed up Trump\u2019s strategy as \u201csow chaos, deepen division and consolidate power.\u201d \n\nFor his harshest critics, the question is now whether Donald Trump breaks the presidency, or whether the presidency breaks Donald Trump. \n\n© 2017 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrew BEATTY"},"topics":[],"title":"In one week, Trump shakes up Washington and the world","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Rising Sun Chatsworth","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"534562899","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Rising Sun Chatsworth","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://risingsunchatsworth.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197468058","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Are they still planning to kill Dhlakama?\u201d asked the 64-year-old rebel, who often speaks about himself in the third person. \n\n\u201cAre they trying to find the river where Dhlakama is drinking from to poison it, or the roads we use to plant anti-personnel landmines?\u201d \n\nDhlakama, whose Renamo party is the main opposition in Mozambique, retreated in October 2012 to his hideout in Gorongosa with 800 former guerrillas demanding a greater share of power. \n\nIn 2013 tensions resurfaced with Renamo fighters again taking up arms against Frelimo, accusing the ruling party of enriching itself at the expense of the southern African country. \n\nOn the eve of the October 2014 general elections Renamo and the government signed a ceasefire. \n\nBut Renamo refused to accept the results of the 2014 elections when it was beaten once more at the polls by Frelimo, which has been in power since the former Portuguese colony\u2019s independence 40 years ago \n\n\u2013 \u2018Won\u2019t give up on truce\u2019 \u2013 \n\nDhlakama has accused the army of not only targeting Renamo members but civilians too. \n\n\u201cThe armed forces go to the villages, open fire to disperse the population, and then ransack the houses making off with chickens and goats, which is typical of Frelimo,\u201d he claimed, adding that women had been beaten and houses torched. \n\n\u201cEither Frelimo does not know how to control its troops or there is a clear lack of will,\u201d he said. \n\nAbuses have also been reported to international organisations by Mozambicans who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries. \n\nAuthorities in December said more than 3,000 people fleeing the conflict now live in government camps, while the UN refugee agency says another 8,600 have been forced to cross the border to Malawi and Zimbabwe. \n\nIn spite of the allegations, Dhlakama has no intention of calling off the ceasefire, which he admits he unilaterally proclaimed in a bid to reopen peace negotiations. \n\nThe peace talks with international mediators resumed in May last year but failed to prevent the escalation of tensions and by mid-December the mediators quit the country. \n\n\u201cI must speak to President Nyusi in the coming days because we are still waiting for him to give the signal for the return of mediators,\u201d said Dhlakama. \n\nThe rebel leader said he will leave his mountain base only to sign a peace agreement. \n\n\u201cWe are not going to give up on the truce. But every day someone calls me up to ask me to extend it beyond March 4. And I always tell them that it will depend on the progress of the negotiations.\u201d \n\n© 2017 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Adrien BARBIER"},"topics":[{"name":"Mozambique news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Mozambique rebel leader accuses soldiers of violating ceasefire","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Rising Sun Overport","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"534541308","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Rising Sun Overport","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://risingsunoverport.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197471396","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We can also provide deliveries to the elderly and handicapped who have difficulty getting around.\u201d \n \nThe company, which has its business office in London, engineering in Estonia and some 90 employees, announced in January it had raised $17.2 million, led by Daimler AG with other investors as it moves to expand its testing and partnerships. \n \nWhile the Starship robots roll at a modest pace of around four miles (six kilometers) per hour, Harris-Burland said they offer a more efficient and economical delivery model than drones, which are being tested by online retail giant Amazon and others. \n   Starship Technology spokesman Henry Harris-Burland says the founders are looking to \u201cdisrupt\u201d an industry which has seen little efficiency improvement from new technology | © AFP/File | MANDEL NGAN   \nThe rolling robots are far less expensive to build and operate than drones and face fewer regulatory issues. \n \nHe said drones might be better-suited to remote and rural areas, while the Starship bots are designed for cities and suburbs, where they can roll along on sidewalks. \n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t see these as competing with drones, we see it as complementary,\u201d Harris-Burland said. \n \nThe Starship robots, which look like high-tech plastic picnic coolers, can carry about 20 pounds (nine kilograms) of goods, suited to three to four grocery bags. They do not offer heating or chilled compartments because rapid deliveries would not need them, according to Harris-Burland. \n \nThey will not have the capacity to leave items on doorsteps, he said, because \u201ccustomers will get delivery within 30 minutes, when they are home\u201d and collect the goods at the door. \n \n\u2013 Mapping sidewalks \u2013 \n \nStarship has agreements for testing with the delivery firm Postmates in Washington and DoorDash in California, as it works toward a commercial model with other partners and retailers. \n \nWhen the pilot begins in February, consumers will be able to order pizza, toothpaste, milk or eggs through the services which may use humans or robots. \n \nStarship is not the only robotic delivery startup looking to disrupt the sector. \n \nCalifornia-based startup Dispatch has raised $2 million in venture funding to begin testing of its rolling robots. Another California firm, Savioke, has agreed to provide delivery bots to hotels and apartment complexes. \n \nStarship says one of its strong points is its \u201cvisual localization\u201d technology that allows for real-time mapping using nine cameras on each robot to help navigate along sidewalks and circumvent obstacles, people and pets. \n \n\u201cWe can see every crosswalk, every traffic light, every pothole,\u201d Harris-Burland said. \n \n\u201cA lot of companies have mapped roads but no one has mapped sidewalks.\u201d \n \nThe navigation is done by artificial intelligence, and the bots are \u201c99 percent autonomous,\u201d according to the spokesman. \n \n\u201cWe want a human being able to oversee the robot\u2019s journey and to intervene whenever there is a problem,\u201d he said. \n \nHarris-Burland said the company\u2019s tests so far in Europe have shown the system works, with no problems related to theft or vandalism. \n \nThe lids of the devices are locked until the customer opens it with a smartphone. If anyone tries to steal it, an alarm will sound, and if it is hijacked the company can track it \u201cto the nearest inch,\u201d he said. \n \n© 2017 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Robotics news","group":"Technology"}],"title":"New wave of robots set to deliver the goods","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Rising Sun Overport","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"534541308","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Rising Sun Overport","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://risingsunoverport.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197471563","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She is the only candidate from the eastern Africa region. \n \nIf she lands the post, she will be the first person from the region to head the AU secretariat since it was established in 2002 and only the second East African chair in the history of the pan-African body initially known as the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). \n \nMr Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania was the Secretary-General (equivalent to the chairperson of the AUC) of the OAU from 1989 to 2001. \nBut Ms Mohamed has to beat Botswana\u2019s Pelonomi Venson Moitoi, Equatorial Guinea\u2019s Agapito Mba Mokuy , Chad\u2019s Moussa Faki Mahamat and Senegal\u2019s Abdoulaye Bathily. \n \nDr Moitoi, the current Foreign Minister of Botswana won the Kigali poll in July, but failed to garner two-thirds of votes cast. \n \nOTHER CANDIDATES \n \nMr Mokuy and Uganda\u2019s Specioza Kazibwe were the other candidates in that election.

By law, candidates must have filed their notice of candidature at least three months before the due date. In this case, all the five registered their applications before October 30 last year. \n \nThe idea is for the AU secretariat based in Addis Ababa to circulate their names among member states. It acts as a pitch for the candidates who must then campaign across the member states, seeking as much support as possible. \nThe AU will also be electing eight commissioners who will be departmental heads of various sectors of the AU. \n \nThese are elected by foreign ministers of member states, known as the AU Executive Council, before they are endorsed by the Assembly of heads of state and government. Here, the candidates and their representatives lobby for support and make compromises or trade-offs. \n \nFIRST ROUND \n \nEach of the candidates has been targeting at least 11 votes in the first round of voting. \n \nThe person who gets the least votes in the first round must drop of the race and this has a bearing on the swing vote in round two of voting. \n \nThis means that long before voting day on Monday, all the candidates can gauge their strength. Some may even pull out before the ballot is cast. \n \nAccording to Rule 38 of the Rules of Procedure, all AU elections must be done by secret ballot; the exception is in electing the ceremonial chairperson of the Assembly where consensus is used. \n \nThe heads of state and government or their verified representatives cast a vote each. \n \nThis privilege is not available to member states under sanctions for coming to power via coup, refusing to service membership dues or declining to abide by previous substantial AU decisions. \n \nThe elections start with votes for the chairperson and deputy. Both the chairperson of the AUC and the deputy are declared after garnering two-thirds of the votes. \n \nThere can be several rounds of voting until the winner is found. \n \nIn the last election, Jean Ping of Gabon and Dr Dlamini-Zuma battled for three rounds of voting. \n \nBEST TWO \n \nIf the third round remains inconclusive, the subsequent election is restricted to the best two candidates. This creates further swing votes. These two can then battle for three more rounds. If no one gets majority votes here, the losing candidate is compelled to withdraw from the race. \n \nBut the commission can postpone elections to another day. The Assembly will also appoint eight commissioners elected by the Executive Council based on \u201cgeographical distribution,\u201d according to the Rules of Procedure. \n \nThis means that regions; east, west, central, south and north, which produce chairperson or deputy chairperson can only have one commissioner each. The rest can have two, but the chairperson and the deputy cannot come from the same region. \n \nIn this race, various candidates are vying to be deputy chairperson. They include Djibouti\u2019s Interior Minister Yacin Elmi Bouh who will battle it out with Thomas Kwesi Quartey from Ghana, Mr Claude Joachim Tiker from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Abdulhakim Rajab Elwaer of Libya. \n \nTheir fate is directly attached to the performance of the candidate for the chairperson, especially since the AU votes for the chairperson first. \n \nOther candidates for the influential positions include the Commissioner for Peace and Security and the Commissioner for Political Affairs. \n \nFACCING COMPETITION \n \nAlgeria\u2019s Smail Chergui is seeking to defend his seat as Commissioner for Peace and Security. \n \nBut the Algerian is facing competition from Burundi\u2019s Ephiphanie Kabushemeye who currently serves as the African Union Mission to Somalia civilian Chief of Staff. \n \nOther candidates include Mr Geoffrey L Mvla and Ms Rose Tujilane Chizumila (who are both Malawians), Ms Fatima Kyari Mohammed of Nigeria and Ms Diye Ba of Mauritania, a former minister. \n \nDjibouti\u2019s Hawa Ahmed Youssouf is seeking the Political Affairs commissioner post but she must beat Ms Minata Samaté Cessouma from Burkina Faso and Mr Churchill Ewumbue Monono from Cameroon. \n \nMeanwhile, President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday chaired the 26th African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) Forum where he said Africa should take pride in the progress it has achieved in promoting good governance. \nThe President said despite the existing challenges, there was so much to celebrate in terms of improved governance and rapid development especially in countries that are participating in the APRM forum. \n \nHe cited the mega infrastructure projects going on in different parts of the continent as one of the easiest routes to Africa\u2019s integration. \n \n\u201cVarious APRM member states continue to implement mega infrastructural projects with a regional and even continental dimension. These programs are a critical part of our regional integration agenda,\u201d said the President when he opened the APRM forum at the African Union Headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The President fingered the Lamu Port South Sudan and Ethiopia Transport corridor, which when completed will link up to West Africa\u2019s Douala\u2013Lagos\u2013Cotonou\u2013Abidjan Corridor, running through Cameroon, Nigeria, Benin, Togo, Ghana and Côte d\u2019Ivoire respectively","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Media Director"},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Ethiopia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"African Union to hold election to determine next chairperson","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"SO","country":"Somalia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Mustaqbal Radio","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597892591","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"name":"Mustaqbal Radio","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mustaqbalradio.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197472446","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:45Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Next is Kuwait and Bahrain that each fell eight factors, to 41 and 43, respectively, and then comes Saudi Arabia which has been placed at 46, six factors lower than the previous rankings. \n \nMonopoly on power \n \nHattar said the deteriorating situation of the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf region in terms of corruption could have been related to increasing desire of the governments in those countries to consolidate their power, leading to more members of the ruling families to occupy key positions in the administration. \n \n\"Persian Gulf States have dropped on the index as ruling households proceed to carry power politically and economically,\" Hattar said, adding that oppressive approaches to freedoms and the absence of an impartial civil society have also played a role. \n \nThe costly war on Yemen \n \nThe official also made a reference to a military coalition of the Arab states of the region, which is currently involved in a war on Yemen, saying the campaign had forced the governments to exercise a policy of financial ambiguity to cover up war expenditures. \n \n\"The army involvement of those states in regional coalitions has raised the ranges of secrecy and ambiguity of public expenditure and state budgets,\" said Hattar. \n \nA global slump in oil prices and the war on Yemen have left an impact on Saudi Arabia's ability to finance its public institutions. The kingdom announced a series of deep spending cuts last year to compensate for more than 100 billion of deficit it had anticipated for the 2017 budget. \n \nQatar, a large oil and gas exporter, has faced similar allegations about corruption over the past few years, especially in relation to its way of obtaining the rights for hosting the 2022 World Cup and how it has treated foreign workers in construction projects meant for the tournament. \n \nReports have also revealed Doha's role in funding terrorist groups in Syria, a country that has been grappling with unrest over the past six years. \n \nSome sources say Qatar has spent tens of billions of dollars to assist anti-Syria terrorists, a policy which seems to have permanently failed in light of recent victories and gains by the government in Damascus against terrorist groups across the country. \n \nME","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Qatar news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Saudi Arabia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Corruption rates have tarnished image of Persian Gulf Arab states, report says","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IR","country":"Iran"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Pars Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"590827750","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Pars Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://parstoday.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197474678","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Seven days later, norms and doctrine that have guided the United States for decades are being re-examined. \n\nTrump\u2019s down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address: a call to arms that tested old distinctions between left and right. \n\n\u201cToday, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cWe are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.\u201d \n\nThe establishment \u201celites\u201d in big cities, in politics and the media were no longer the technocrats in charge of the world\u2019s only superpower, they were the enemy. \n\nThe new president also put the rest of the world on notice. \n\nFor the last 75 years, America had been what Barack Obama described as the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d \u2014 the glue that bound the global order. \n\nThe era of Trump would be the era of \u201cAmerica first,\u201d he said, of naked self-interest and zero-sum diplomacy. Old alliances would be reassessed, new alliances would be explored. \n\nBefore his inauguration, many asked if the presidency would change Donald Trump, or whether Donald Trump would change the presidency. \n\nBarely 20 minutes into his four-year term, anyone who was listening had their answer. \n\n\u2013 Rolling thunder \u2013 \n\nBefore arriving at the Oval Office, Trump\u2019s strategists had decided to use the first few weeks to unleash a daily wave of executive orders. \n\nThe aim was to unbalance opponents, define Trump as a man of action and slake his supporters\u2019 thirst for change. \n\nFor much of middle America, globalization, automation and the Great Recession had been apocalyptic. \n\nPolitics had passed them over and worse, they felt steamrollered by \u201ccoastal elites\u201d in America\u2019s \u201cculture wars\u201d over abortion, gay rights, immigration, global warming and religion. \n\nTrump had won the election by promising to be their champion, and he was going to \u2014 as Ronald Reagan said \u2014 \u201cdance with the one that brung ya.\u201d \n\nFor the most part, the CEO-in-chief put forward actions that could have come from any Republican in the country: defunding abortion, preening the military and approving oil pipelines. \n\nBut it was coated with a thick veneer of nationalist and populist rhetoric, and accompanying policies championed by top aide Steve Bannon. \n\nTrump ripped up a trans-Pacific trade deal designed to counterbalance China\u2019s regional economic power, imposed a ban on refugees from Syria and migrants from seven other Muslim countries. \n\nHe ordered planning to begin to build a wall on Mexico\u2019s southern border and picked a very public fight with Mexico\u2019s president Enrique Pena Nieto, who cancelled a trip to Washington. \n\nThe United States, a nation founded by migrants, was now willing to shut its doors. \n\nNot since Obama\u2019s election or perhaps the Iraq War has America\u2019s image around the world changed so dramatically and so quickly. \n\nBut Trump supporters saw an outsider sticking up for them and sticking it to the elites. \n\n\u201cGet used to it,\u201d said Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, boasting that Trump had delivered a \u201cshock to the system.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s just getting started,\u201d she said. \n\n\u2013 Rocky start \u2013 \n\nBut it was not all positive for Trump. The White House is far from purring. Key positions have yet to be filled and the decision making process is haphazard. \n\nTrump aides were forced to publicly row back suggestions of a 20 percent border tax on Mexican goods and defend a chaotic rollout of the refugee and migrant ban. \n\nThroughout the week, Trump engaged in intemperate outbursts about the size of his inaugural crowd, alleged election fraud and perceived media persecution. \n\nPrivately, in call after call, he complained to top aides about press coverage. The impression was of a man focused on his image more than running the country. \n\nTrump also seemed like a a man for whom becoming US president was not adulation enough. \n\nSpokesman Sean Spicer \u2014 between tirades and missteps \u2014 offered a window onto the soul of the White House. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this constant theme to undercut the enormous support he has,\u201d Spicer said. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably frustrating when you\u2019re continually told it\u2019s not big enough; it\u2019s not good enough. You can\u2019t win.\u201d \n\nBut critics saw a more sinister motive for the outbursts, particularly Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that three million people voted illegally in the election. \n\nBrian Klaas, an expert on global democracy at the London School of Economics, sees Trump \u201ccasting aspersions (without evidence) on electoral integrity is a key way to restrict voting rights and erode confidence in elections.\u201d \n\n\u201cAttacking the media and blurring the lines of truth with state narratives not grounded in fact is important to sowing public doubt,\u201d he said. \n\nMindy Finn, who ran as a independent vice presidential candidate, summed up Trump\u2019s strategy as \u201csow chaos, deepen division and consolidate power.\u201d \n\nFor his harshest critics, the question is now whether Donald Trump breaks the presidency, or whether the presidency breaks Donald Trump. \n\n© 2017 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrew BEATTY"},"topics":[],"title":"In one week, Trump shakes up Washington and the world","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Rising Sun Overport","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"534541308","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Rising Sun Overport","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://risingsunoverport.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197475643","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But the judge\u2019s ruling extended to all individuals facing similar situations across the United States.\n\nRuling \n\nThe two plaintiffs included two Iraqi refugees who had spent hours detained at JFK: Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who had worked for the US government for a decade, and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who arrived in the country to join his wife, a US contractor.\n\nThe judge, who was nominated by former president Barack Obama, ruled that the deportations could cause the plaintiffs \"irreparable harm\" by returning them to countries where they had been threatened. She also noted that the plaintiffs included visa-holders who had already been approved for entry to the US, and who, only two days before, would have been let into the country without incident. \"Obviously, we\u2019re extremely pleased,\" the head of the ACLU, Anthony Romero, told the Guardian. The judge, he said, \"obviously gets the importance of the executive order and its impact on hundreds if not thousands of immigrants and refugees.\"\n\nThe stay, which applies nationwide, will last at least until a hearing scheduled for February 21st, the judge said, and includes people on valid visas of all kinds and green-card holders.\n\nHowever, it would only impact those who were \"on American soil\" - ie those who had been mid-flight or had landed while the executive order was being signed by the president, Mr Romero said.\n\nHe estimated that there were at least 100-200 people currently being held in airports across the country, however he said the number could be higher. Asked by the judge to confirm the number, government lawyers were unable to respond with confidence.\n\nThe judge ordered the government to provide a list of all people currently being held in violation of the order at US airports or in flights, to protests from the government lawyers.\n\nHeld in violation \"\n\n\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unduly burdensome to get a list of names,\" judge AnnDonnelly said.\n\nMr Darweesh and Mr Alshawi had both been released earlier on Saturday, the US attorney confirmed, however Mr Romero specified that Mr Darweesh had been released \"at the discretion of the executive branch\".\n\nDespite the stay, however, lawyers for the plaintiffs and civil liberties advocates drew immediate concern for the well-being of those granted a stay, as it was widely assumed that the individuals in question would be held in immigration detention facilities until their hearing, three weeks away.\n\n\"It\u2019s a long time for people to be sitting in detention centres,\" Mr Romero said, adding that the ACLU would be monitoring the conditions in those facilities.\n\nBrian Chesky, the co-founder of Airbnb, tweeted that his company would provide \"free housing to refugees and anyone not allowed in the US\", and suggested anyone should contact him if in urgent need for housing.\n\nJudge Donnelly suggested the lawyers should return to court, if the travellers were to be placed in detention rather than be released. \"I guess I\u2019ll just hear from you,\" she said.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, president Trump\u2019s executive order, signed the day before, sowed chaos in airports, universities, corporations and living rooms in the US and abroad, as people grappled with the ramifications of its sometimes vague language. \n\nTravellers were detained at checkpoints, universities urged at-risk students not to leave the country or to seek legal advice while tech giants quickly recalled their workers from abroad. \n\nThroughout, families took calls from panicked loved ones whose lives were cast into disarray, unable to return to their homes, with everything from cars to pets waiting where they left them.\n\nWhile the ruling gave hope to those detained on US soil, millions of people around the world face uncertain futures. \n\nPeople like Farah Alkhafji, who came to the US as a refugee from Iraq having endured the killing of her husband, the burning of her house and the kidnapping of her father. She was just weeks away from taking her US citizenship test.\n\nTranslating for US troops \n\nSimilarly, Hayder, who survived multiple bomb attacks while translating for US troops during the war in Iraq. Hayder, who has asked the Guardian not to use his real name, has a plane ticket from Texas from Baghdad that he may never get to use.\n\nShortly after judge Donnelly\u2019s ruling, a federal judge in Virginia banned the deportation of detainees being held at Dulles International Airport, and also ordered officials there to allow detainees to meet with their lawyers. Judge Leonie Brinkema\u2019s temporary restraining order, however, blocked deportations for just seven days. In another case in Washington state, federal Judge Thomas Zilly stopped the US government from deporting two people. A hearing was set for February 3rd for Mr Zilly \"to determine whether to lift the stay\".\n\nThe hearing in Brooklyn though short, was potent, dealing the first successful legal challenge to an administration which has barrelled aggressively through its first week in power, implementing its draconian set of \"extreme vetting\" measures.\n\nThe swift pace at which the travel ban was drawn up was plain in the conduct of the court. Lawyers representing the government displayed a clear lack of information, echoing the confusion of various government agencies and officials in the past 24 hours, who had been implementing the order haphazardly.\n\n\"Things have unfolded with such speed, that we haven\u2019t had time to review the legal situation yet,\" an attorney representing the government said.\n\nAlerted by the ACLU to the fact that a Syrian woman with a valid US green card had been detained upon arrival into the United States and had been placed on a plane due to take off \"back to Syria\" within 30 minutes, the judge moved swiftly to reach her conclusion.\n\n\"Apparently there is someone being put on a plane. What do you think about that? Back to Syria,\" an increasingly frustrated judge Donnelly asked lawyers for the government. \n\nAssurances\n\nShe pressed them further on whether the government could give assurances that the woman would suffer no \"irreparable harm\" upon her arrival in Syria.\n\nBut Gisela Westwater, a government lawyer who spoke to judge by phone from Washington, simply replied that the government did not have sufficient information about the woman or the circumstances of her detention. \"And as your honour has suggested, we all do require additional time to have more facts.\"\n\n\"Well that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m going to grant this stay,\" judge Donnelly replied to muffled cheers in the room. The rapt audience, filled with of civil liberties advocates, lawyers and journalists who had tunnelled through a crowd of protesters chanting \"No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here\", was told by the judge to rein in their palpable excitement.\n\nA lawyer with the ACLU later confirmed that US immigration officials were removing the Syrian woman from the plane.\n\nSeveral hundred people waited for the verdict outside the courthouse, holding signs and chanting \"let them go!\" and \"We believe that we will win\". When the verdict was announced to the crowd less than an hour later, those gathered in the bitter cold erupted in loud cheers.\n\nSimilar protests were replicated at more than a dozen airports around the country. Hundreds of people gathered to demonstrate at Kennedy airport in New York and the international ports in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, Philadelphia and other cities where people were detained and families separated overnight. \n\nMultiple immigration lawyers were also at airports, offering their services pro-bono to those detained.

Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada.\" \n   \nTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada \n\u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 28, 2017   \nTrudeau also posted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport in late 2015. Trudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected. \n\n \nA spokeswoman for Trudeau said he has a message for Trump. \n \n\"The Prime Minister is looking forward to discussing the successes of Canada's immigration and refugee policy with the President when they next speak,\" spokeswoman Kate Purchase told The Associated Press. \n \nTrudeau is expected to the visit the White House soon. \n \nThe prime minister has refrained from criticizing Trump to avoid offending the new president. Canada wants to avoid becoming a target like Mexico has. More than 75 percent of Canada's exports go to the U.S. \n \nBrad Wall, the conservative premier of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, offered his support to Trudeau. \n \n\"Sask has welcomed approx 2000 refugees this past year,\" Wall posted on Twitter. \"We stand ready to assist fed gov't re: anyone stranded by the US ban.\" \n \nToronto Mayor John Tory also weighed in, noting that the city is the most diverse in the world. \n \n\"We understand that as Canadians we are almost all immigrants, and that no one should be excluded on the basis of their ethnicity or nationality,\" Tory said in a statement. \n \nTrump signed a sweeping executive order Friday that he billed as a necessary step to stop \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from coming to the U.S. Included is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program. \n \nTrump's order singled out Syrians for the most aggressive ban, ordering that anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war, are indefinitely blocked from coming to the United States. \n \nWhite House National Security adviser Michael Flynn told Canada's national security adviser that holders of Canadian passports, including dual citizens, will not be affected by the ban, Purchase said. \n \n\"We have been assured that Canadian citizens traveling on Canadian passports will be dealt with in the usual process,\" Purchase said. \n \nTrudeau later posted the statement on Twitter with the hashtag \"ACanadianIsACanadian.\" \n \nEarlier the U.S. State Department said that Canadians with dual citizenship from Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and Libya would be denied entry for the next three months. \n \nThe Syrian refugee crisis became a major issue in Canada's election in late 2015 because of the haunting image of a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy washed up on a Turkish beach. The boy had relatives in Canada. Tima Kurdi, the aunt of the boy who became a symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis, called the U.S. ban on Syrian refugees inhumane and said she was proud of Canada. \n \nTrudeau's tweet quickly received hundreds of thousands of likes. \"Welcome to Canada\" trended on social media in the country.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Canada news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"PM Trudeau says Canada welcomes refugees","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hillsborough","zipCode":"03101","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Manchester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WMUR New Hampshire","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169730058","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3030"},"name":"WMUR New Hampshire","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wmur.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/hashtag/WelcomeToCanada?src=hash","https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/825438460265762816"],"sequenceId":"695197486883","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:49:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://hips.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/trudeau-1480355101.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The wall is unnecessary. It will not stop people from coming illegally. It costs too much. \n   \nYet something deeper is afoot here. The idea of a permanent barrier between our countries goes to the heart of the divide between our two Americas on the most fundamental of questions. \n   \nWho are we? What is a nation? What does America stand for? \n   \nThose desperate to see the wall built, illegal immigration halted, and those here illegally deported, see the country they grew up in as dying, disappearing, with something strange and foreign taking its place. \n   \nIt is not only that illegal migrants take jobs from Americans, that they commit crimes, or that so many require subsidized food, welfare, housing, education and health care. It is that they are changing our country. They are changing who we are. \n   \nTwo decades ago, the Old Right and the neocons engaged in a ferocious debate over what America was and is. \n   \nWere we from the beginning a new, unique, separate and identifiable people like the British, French and Germans? \n   \nOr was America a new kind of nation, an ideological nation, an invented nation, united by an acceptance of the ideas and ideals of Jefferson, Madison, Lincoln and Dr. King? \n   \nThe Old Right contended that America existed even before the Revolution, and that this new nation, this new people, wrote its own birth certificate, the Constitution. Before Washington, Madison and Hamilton ever went to Philadelphia, America existed. \n   \nWhat forced the premature birth of the nation -- was the Revolution. \n   \nWe did not become a new nation because we embraced Jefferson's notion about all men being \"created equal.\" We became a new people from our familial break with the Mother Country, described in the declaration as a severing of ties with our \"brethren\" across the sea who no longer deserved our loyalty or love. \n   \nThe United States came into being in 1789. The Constitution created the government, the state. But the country already existed. \n   \nWhen the Irish came in the mid-19th century to escape the famine and the Germans to escape Bismarck's Prussia, and the Italians, Jews, Poles, Greeks, Slovaks came to Ellis Island, they were foreigners who became citizens, and then, after a time, Americans. \n   \nNot until decades after the Great Migration of 1890-1920, with the common trials of the Depression, World War II and Cold War, were we truly forged again into one united nation and people. \n   \nBy 1960, almost all of us shared the same heroes and holidays, spoke the same language and cherished the same culture. \n   \nWhat those with memories of that America see happening today is the disintegration of our nation of yesterday. The savagery of our politics, exemplified in the last election, testifies to how Americans are coming to detest one another as much as the Valley Forge generation came to detest the British from whom they broke free. \n   \n Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox  \n   \nIn 1960, we were a Western Christian country. Ninety percent of our people traced their roots to Europe. Ninety percent bore some connection to the Christian faith. To the tens of millions for whom Trump appeals, what the wall represents is our last chance to preserve that nation and people. \n   \nTo many on the cosmopolitan left, ethnic or national identity is not only not worth fighting for, it is not even worth preserving. It is a form of atavistic tribalism or racism. \n   \nThe Trump wall then touches on the great struggle of our age. \n   \nGiven that 80 percent of all people of color vote Democratic, neither the Trump movement nor the Republican Party can survive the Third Worldization of the United States now written in the cards. \n   \nMoreover, with the disintegration of the nation we are seeing, and with talk of the breakup of states like Texas and secession of states like California, how do we survive as one nation and people? \n   \nOld Europe never knew mass immigration until the 20th century. \n   \nNow, across Europe, center-left and center-right parties are facing massive defections because they are perceived as incapable of coping with the existential threat of the age -- the overrunning of the continent from Africa and the Middle East. \n   \nPresident Trump's wall is a statement to the world: This is our country. We decide who comes here. And we will defend our borders. \n   \nThe crisis of our time is not that some Americans are saying this, but that so many are too paralyzed to say it, or do not care, or embrace what is happening to their country.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"PATRICK BUCHANAN: This is what Donald Trump's wall says to the world","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Plymouth","zipCode":"51031","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Le Mars","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sioux City Journal","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169659120","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2875"},"name":"Sioux City Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.siouxcityjournal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197487286","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Alan Power equalised from a penalty in the second half before Fikayo Tomori knocked a cross by Nathan Arnold into his own goal. Theo Robinson crowned a thrilling and deserved victory by scoring a third five minutes from time. \n \nRelated: Wolves stun Liverpool after Richard Stearman kickstarts FA Cup upset \n \nMany Lincoln fans queued through the night in sub-zero temperatures this week to get tickets for their club\u2019s first fourth-round tie for 41 years. They and most of the other members of a crowd of 9,469 gathered at Sincil Bank in the hope of bearing witness to something close to a miracle in the ground overlooked by Lincoln Cathedral. The atmosphere at kickoff was rapturous. \n \nYet once the contest started it became clear that referring to an upset here as a miracle would have been unfair, as there was nothing freakish or lucky about it. Lincoln, 73 places below Brighton in the football pyramid, showed that they had reached this stage because they are a diligent team benefiting from the expert tuition of Danny Cowley, the former PE teacher who gave up his day job last summer to manage the club full-time. \n \nCowley\u2019s counterpart, Chris Hughton, may have fielded a weakened team but his reserves have high pedigree and did not play as if they disrespected their lowly but dynamic opponents. Brighton knew from the off that they would have to be on their guard to avoid becoming Lincoln\u2019s latest victim in this, the non-league side\u2019s seventh match of a Cup run that has captivated the city. \n \nBrighton\u2019s plan was to prick the underdog\u2019s enthusiasm as soon as possible and Glenn Murray nearly deflated the crowd in the second minute with a close-range header but Paul Farman parried the shot. Lincoln settled quickly after that and began to ruffle their esteemed visitors with sharp, tidy play. Sam Habergham and Terry Hawkridge were particularly menacing when they combined down the left, while the hulking Matt Rhead was a menace in the air and Lincoln\u2019s set-pieces regularly caused problems. Theo Robinson even triggered an explosion of joy when he rifled the ball into the net in the eighth minute but only because the giddy home fans had not noticed that the referee had already blown for offside. \n \nBrighton\u2019s winger Solly March nearly brought more groans \u2013 and gasps \u2013 from the home fans when he let fly with a swirling shot from 25 yards but it bounced back off the crossbar. There was no reprieve for the hosts in the 23rd minute, when Towell put Brighton in front with a delicious finish, flipping the ball into the net with the outside of his foot after running onto a flick-on from Murray. That went contrary to the script of one fairytale but was, nonetheless, a special moment for a player who, because of injury, has had to endure a long hard luck story since joining Brighton from Dundalk in 2015. The former Irish young player of the year had not yet featured in the Championship this season so this was a significant goal for him. \n \nRelated: With Lincoln on the FA Cup trail: from 4.20am ticket queues to toilet trouble \n \nLincoln tried to nullify it immediately and nearly did so thanks to a superb effort by Nathan Arnold. The Brighton goalkeeper Niki Maeneppa had to fling himself across his goal to push the midfielder\u2019s curling shot from 30 yards around the post. \n \nThat, however, was as close as Lincoln got to an equaliser in the first half. They might have fallen further behind before the break if Murray had been able to direct a header on target from six yards. Murray\u2019s travails soon worsened, as 10 minutes into the second half he gifted Lincoln a chance to equalise: the referee, Andy Madley, penalised the striker for a perceived foul on Theo Robinson. Worse, before play stopped Robinson was outjumped by Maeneppa, who injured himself as he fell to the ground. Brighton had to resort to their substitute goalkeeper, Casper Ankergen, who was sent the wrong way as Power rolled the ball into the net from the spot. Cue joyous songs of praise from the Sincil Bank congregation. \n \nLincoln\u2019s players, meanwhile, were not satisfied. They pursued glory with a tenacity that unhinged the visitors. Critical evidence of that came within five minutes, Tomori was so flustered that he turned a wicked cross by Arnold into his own goal from six yards. Now \u201cWe\u2019re going to Wembley\u201d became the home crowd\u2019s hymn. Preposterous, of course. But maybe not completely impossible for Cowley\u2019s admirable team. \n \nRobinson reinforced that thought here by making it 3-1 before the end, finishing smartly from the edge of the box after Brighton had been pestered into losing possession. \n \nThis article was written by Paul Doyle at Sincil Bank, for The Observer on Saturday 28th January 2017 17.31 Europe/London \n \nguardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Theo Robinson seals shock victory for non-league Lincoln over Brighton","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Here Is The City","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708994","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Here Is The City","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hereisthecity.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/lincoln/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/fa-cup/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc/","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/28/liverpool-wolverhampton-wanderers-fa-cup-match-report","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/27/lincoln-city-fa-cup-brighton-fourth-round","https://gu.com/p/5zayx"],"sequenceId":"695197487480","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:18Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/565/lincoln_city_players_celebrate_after_the_match_431563.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Having been brought down in the penalty area by Phil Edwards, the Serbian saw his spot-kick brilliantly saved by the Oxford goalkeeper, Simon Eastwood, diving to his right. \n \nNewcastle, who have not reached the fifth round since 2006, were punished when the Oxford centre-half Curtis Nelson made it 2-0 on 79 minutes, firmly heading home Rob Hall\u2019s corner at the back post. And the 19-year-old Spanish striker Toni Martínez added a third, on his debut, with a well-placed looping header three minutes from time. \n \nDissent was in the air at Ewood Park where many Blackburn Rovers and Blackpool fans boycotted their fourth-round tie, many protesting against their respective club owners instead in the stadium car park, from where tennis balls were thrown into the ground at one stage in the first half. On the pitch, however, Blackburn won comfortably 2-0 in front of a sparse crowd of 9,327. \n \nIt made it a disappointing return to Blackburn for their former manager Gary Bowyer, now in charge of their League Two visitors. Rovers, who sacked Bowyer as boss in November 2015, led in the ninth minute through a simple Sam Gallagher header. Elliott Bennett then doubled their lead with a spectacular 30-yard strike \u2013 his first of the season \u2013 and any lingering hopes of a Blackpool revival were sunk when Kelvin Mellor received a second booking in the 65th minute for a rash challenge. \n \nSteven Defour\u2019s brilliant second-half chip capped a sixth straight home win for Burnley as they saw off the out-of-form Championship side Bristol City . The Clarets continued their impressive run at Turf Moor to move into the fifth round of the competition for the first time in six years with a comfortable 2-0 success. \n \nSam Vokes, who was seen among the Southampton fans celebrating their progress to Wembley in midweek , inched his employers closer to their own trip there with a first-half effort \u2013 his 50th goal for the club \u2013 before Defour sent a glorious chip over Bristol City goalkeeper Fabian Giefer after the break. \n \nThe German striker Collin Quaner marked his Huddersfield Town debut with a goal as the Championship promotion challengers cruised past Rochdale 4-0 at Spotland. Quaner, signed from Union Berlin last week, converted an Izzy Brown cross five minutes from the break before a Brown penalty and two late goals from the substitute Michael Hefele wrapped up victory. \n \nThe League One hosts must have fancied their chances of reaching the fifth round for the first time since 2003 but were left to rue missing two superb first-half chances to take the lead. Ultimately David Wagner\u2019s side proved just too strong with a polished second-half display highlighted by Quamer, whose swift counterattack set up the fourth and final goal for Hefele to leave Rochdale to focus on their own challenge for the League One play-offs. \n \nThis article was written by Tom Davies, for The Guardian on Saturday 28th January 2017 18.23 Europe/London \n \nguardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Newcastle United news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"FA Cup roundup: Oxford United cruise past Newcastle into fifth round","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Here Is The City","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708994","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Here Is The City","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hereisthecity.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/fa-cup/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/oxford-united/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/newcastle-united-fc/","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/28/lincoln-city-brighton-hove-albion-fa-cup-match-report","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/blackpool/","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/25/liverpool-southampton-efl-cup-semi-final-match-report","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/bristol-city/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/huddersfield/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/rochdale/","https://gu.com/p/5zb57"],"sequenceId":"695197487642","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/565/newcastle_uniteds_aleksandar_mitrovic_in_action_with_oxford_unit_431554.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hillsborough","zipCode":"03101","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Manchester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WMUR New Hampshire","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169730058","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3030"},"name":"WMUR New Hampshire","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wmur.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197489470","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://hips.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/traveler-released-at-jfk-airport-1485651543.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The side from League Two had come agonisingly close to pulling off one of the great FA Cup upsets and causing severe embarrassment for Tottenham Hotspur in the process. \n \nThey led by two goals at half-time, then had one foot in the fifth round when Garry Thompson restored their lead with six minutes left, and it beggared belief that Ainsworth looked like he wanted the earth to swallow him at the end of an impossibly entertaining contest. \n \nWycombe\u2019s manager looked inconsolable. He appeared to be on the verge of tears as he put his hand over his face and tried to make sense of how his heroic players had managed to lose. Tottenham were down to 10 men when Thompson made it 3-2, having lost Kieran Trippier to an injury after using up their three substitutions, and still there was time for Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side to subject them to the cruelty of defeat when Joe Jacobson turned in Heung-Min Son\u2019s shot in the seventh minute of stoppage time. \n \nRelated: Branislav Ivanovic proves the unlikely star as Chelsea rout Brentford \n \nPlacing greater focus on Tottenham\u2019s emerging title challenge, Pochettino made nine changes to the team that drew at Manchester City and handed opportunities to some of his younger players, raising Wycombe\u2019s hopes of causing an unlikely shock. Given tremendous backing by their noisy travelling supporters, Wycombe sought to capitalise on Tottenham\u2019s unfamiliarity with a fast start and the reward for their positivity came when they took a deserved lead in the 23rd minute. \n \nBy the time Paul Hayes walloped his meaty volley through a mass of bodies, the only surprise was that it had taken so long for Wycombe\u2019s goal to arrive. They had underlined their attacking intent as early as the first minute, when Sido Jombati capitalised on indecision in Tottenham\u2019s defence by charging down the right and lifting a deep cross towards Adebayo Akinfenwa, who rose unchallenged to head back across goal for Paul Hayes, who wastefully headed against the bar from close range. Wycombe\u2019s captain would not allow that miss to affect him. \n \nInstead Ainsworth\u2019s admirable side continued to unnerve Tottenham with their endeavour and verve. Dominic Gape and Luke O\u2019Nien performed with distinction in midfield and Wycombe often favoured a direct approach, sending long balls towards Akinfenwa and feeding off their big striker\u2019s hold-up. Spreading anxiety with his physicality, Akinfenwa went close with a couple of headers, while Sam Wood almost caught out Spurs goalkeeper Michel Vorm with a clever lob. \n \nThe only thing missing for Wycombe was a goal. The longer they went without one, the more it felt as though Tottenham would discover their fluency and make them pay with one moment of ruthlessness. Yet when Heung-Min Son, a nimble threat in the middle of Tottenham\u2019s front three, found himself with an open goal after a calamitous punch by Jamal Blackman, the South Korean screwed wide from a tight angle. \n \nWycombe breathed a huge sigh of relief; then they scored. Josh Onomah, otherwise anonymous, headed Joe Jacobson\u2019s corner only as far as Hayes, who watched the ball drop before displaying wonderful technique and composure to hammer a left-footed shot past the stranded Vorm, a brilliant moment for a 33-year-old journeyman who has spent his entire career scrabbling arond the lower leagues. \n \nTottenham were stunned. They were all over the place, enraging Pochettino with their lack of cohesion. Passes went astray, crosses sailed behind for goal-kicks and when they did create chances to equalise, they were denied by determined Wycombe defending. Blackman pushed Son\u2019s drive to safety, while Moussa Sissoko saw a shot bundled off the line by Hayes. Who else? \n \nYet Tottenham were playing in fits and starts. Back came Wycombe, refusing either to lie down or sit back. When Akinfenwa made a nuisance of himself, the ball ran for Wood to race into the area and wait for Cameron Carter-Vickers to let himself down with a clumsy challenge that betrayed the 19-year-old defender\u2019s inexperience. Hayes squeezed his penalty past Vorm, sparking joyous scenes on the visiting bench. \n \nTottenham departed the field to boos at half-time and presumably faced worse from Pochettino in the dressing room. The Argentinian responded by replacing the speedy but aimless Georges-Kévin N\u2019koudou with Vincent Janssen, a substitution that gave Tottenham a focal point in attack. \n \nWycombe will reflect on the moment when Harry Winks, tussling with O\u2019Nien, rashly shoved his opponent to the ground and only received a booking early in the second half. Winks could easily have been sent off and Tottenham made the most of that reprieve by raising their quality and intensity, with the increasingly dangerous Son\u2019s shoot-on-sight policy rewarded when his deflected shot beat Blackman at his near post just before the hour. \n \nPochettino immediately threw on Moussa Dembélé and Dele Alli and now it was Wycombe\u2019s turn to wobble. Overwhelmed by Tottenham\u2019s sudden burst of energy, their stubborn resistance wilted and the equaliser duly arrived when Roger East pointed to the spot after Aaron Pierre obstructed Janssen. Pierre looked aggrieved, but Janssen bundled his penalty underneath Blackman\u2019s dive. \n \nRelated: Sterling leads the way as Manchester City ease past struggling Crystal Palace \n \nThe drama was unrelenting, the pace frenetic. Having made their three substitutions, Tottenham were reduced to 10 men when Tripper limped off with an injury and Wycombe\u2019s belief returned. On in place of the tiring Akinfenwa, Myles Weston produced one of the great cup dribbles, surging past Eric Dier on the left and speeding into the space vacated by Trippier. \n \nNow Weston had a choice to make: whether to go for glory himself or seek support from his team-mates. He opted for the latter, pausing before whipping a beautiful cross into the middle, where Garry Thompson, another substitute, leapt majestically to direct a classic header past the despairing Vorm. \n \nIt was a goal worthy of winning any game, but Alli had other ideas. A poor kick from Blackman put Wycombe under pressure and Alli cleverly threaded a low finish into the left corner to spare Tottenham\u2019s blushes. \n \nUp went the fourth official\u2019s board, showing six minutes of stoppage time. Wycombe thought that they had crawled over the line when Blackman redeemed himself by pushing Janssen\u2019s header over, only for Son to break their hearts. \n \nThis article was written by Jacob Steinberg at White Hart Lane, for The Observer on Saturday 28th January 2017 17.23 Europe/London \n \nguardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Son Heung-min shines as Tottenham come from behind to beat Wycombe","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Here Is The City","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708994","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Here Is The City","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hereisthecity.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/wycombe/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/fa-cup/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/tottenham-hotspur-fc/","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/28/chelsea-brentford-fa-cup-match-report","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/28/crystal-palace-manchester-city-fa-cup-match-report","https://gu.com/p/5zatq"],"sequenceId":"695197489767","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:46Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/565/tottenhams_son_heungmin_celebrates_after_the_game_431572.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But it shouldn't erase the troubling memory of one major element of Trump's inaugural address. \n   \nThe foreign policy section has received far less attention than so revolutionary a declaration deserved. It radically redefined the American national interest as understood since World War II. \n   \nTrump outlined a world in which foreign relations are collapsed into a zero-sum game. They gain, we lose. As in: \"For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries\" while depleting our own. And most provocatively this: \"The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.\" \n   \nJFK's inaugural pledged to support any friend and oppose any foe to assure the success of liberty. Note that Trump makes no distinction between friend and foe (and no reference to liberty). They're all out to use, exploit and surpass us. \n   \nNo more, declared Trump: \"From this day forward, it's going to be only America First.\" \n   \nImagine how this resonates abroad. \"America First\" was the name of the organization led by Charles Lindbergh that bitterly fought FDR before U.S. entry into World War II -- right through the Battle of Britain -- to keep America neutral between Churchill's Britain and Hitler's Reich. \n   \nNot that Trump was consciously imitating Lindbergh. I doubt he was even aware of the reference. He just liked the phrase. But I can assure you that in London and in every world capital they are aware of the antecedent and the intimations of a new American isolationism. Trump gave them good reason to think so, going on to note \"the right of all nations to put their own interests first.\" America included. \n   \nSome claim that putting America first is a reassertion of American exceptionalism. On the contrary, it is the antithesis. It makes America no different from all the other countries that define themselves by a particularist blood-and-soil nationalism. What made America exceptional, unique in the world, was defining its own national interest beyond its narrow economic and security needs to encompass the safety and prosperity of a vast array of allies. A free world marked by open trade and mutual defense was President Truman's vision, shared by every president since. \n   \nUntil now. \n   \nSome have argued that Trump is just dangling a bargaining chip to negotiate better terms of trade or alliance. Or that Trump's views are so changeable and unstable -- telling European newspapers two weeks ago that NATO is obsolete and then saying \"NATO is very important to me\" -- that this is just another unmoored entry on a ledger of confusion. \n   \n Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox  \n   \nBut both claims are demonstrably wrong. An inaugural address is no off-the-cuff riff. These words are the product of at least three weeks of deliberate crafting for an address that Trump said would express his philosophy. Moreover, to remove any ambiguity, Trump prefaced his \"America first\" proclamation with: \"From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.\" \n   \nTrump's vision misunderstands the logic underlying the far larger, far-reaching view of Truman. The Marshall Plan sure took wealth away from the American middle class and distributed it abroad. But for a reason. Altruism, in part. But mostly to stabilize Western Europe as a bulwark against an existential global enemy. \n   \nWe carried many free riders throughout the Cold War. The burden was heavy. But this was not a mindless act of charity; it was an exercise in enlightened self-interest. After all, it was indeed better to subsidize foreign armies -- German, South Korean, Turkish and dozens of others -- and have them stand with us, rather than stationing even more American troops everywhere around the world at greater risk of both blood and treasure. \n   \nWe are embarking upon insularity and smallness. Nor is this just theory. Trump's long-promised but nonetheless abrupt withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership is the momentous first fruit of his foreign policy doctrine.

On a day when Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning travelers from 7 Muslim countries sparked outcry on social media and protests at airports from coast to coast, the president\u2019s daughter had something else on her mind: her date outfit.\n\nJust after midnight on Sunday morning, Ivanka Trump posted a photo of herself on her Instagram and Twitter accounts dressed in a silver metallic gown, with her husband Jared Kushner dressed in a tuxedo by her side. The couple is standing in front of a mirrored wall, which shows Kushner\u2019s hand resting on Trump\u2019s posterior.\n\nThe photograph generated swift reaction on social media, with some comments highlighting the inappropriateness of the post in the midst of the humanitarian chaos that ensued Saturday in the U.S., after dozens of refugees from Syria, Iraq and other banned countries were detained at airports, American Civil Liberties Union lawyers rushed to offer aid, and protesters clogged terminals and streets in New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, Seattle and San Francisco.\n\nIvanka has faced criticism on several fronts in recent weeks, most notably when her namesake fashion label promoted a $10,000 bracelet she wore during a 60 Minutes interview the Trump family gave after Election Night.\u2028In early January, to comply with ethic guidelines, she officially stepped away from her brand. But she has continued to play the role of a fashion plate in her new home in Washington, D.C., documenting on her social media channels her outfits in a style similar to a fashion magazine.\n\nAt the inauguration, Ivanka received attention for wearing designers Oscar de la Renta and Carolina Herrera. And interest in an Aspinal of London bag she carried to the National Prayer Service spiked, suggesting she in her new role in the Washington spotlight adjacent to, for now, the Trump administration.\n\nNo word yet on who designed the metallic silver gown she wore Saturday night. @chrislhayes @IvankaTrump wow who wore it better pic.twitter.com/HhWBPO3A9V @IvankaTrump glad you're enjoying your new house in DC while Syrian children die","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Booth Moore"},"topics":[],"title":"Ivanka Trump Posts Photo of Date Outfit in Midst of Humanitarian Chaos","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Hollywood Reporter","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659601","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2267"},"name":"Hollywood Reporter","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/chrislhayes","https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump","https://t.co/HhWBPO3A9V","https://twitter.com/janie/status/825574615829381121","https://twitter.com/MattfDoyle","https://twitter.com/crawdady21","https://twitter.com/Eva_Shogouki01","https://twitter.com/renae_rp/status/825594829497262080","https://twitter.com/VTAliTriumphant/status/825571193491222528","https://t.co/I5ab22nLNx","https://twitter.com/VoiceOfThePhan/status/825576979428679680","https://twitter.com/VoiceOfThePhan","https://twitter.com/Songbird_7_/status/825577957221662721"],"sequenceId":"695197497325","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:46Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn5.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/01/ivankadress.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Worldwide, about 10 million people develop active TB each year and about 1.5 million people die of the disease, with India, Indonesia, China, Nigeria, Pakistan and South Africa accounting for 60 percent of the total, according to the World Health Organization. The United States saw 9,557 cases in 2015 and, according to the most recent data available, 493 deaths from the disease in 2014. More than 2 billion people have latent infections of the disease-causing bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, meaning they could ultimately develop active disease. \n\nThe current standard for treating TB is a four-drug regimen that has been in use since the 1980s. It was developed through trial and error, with physicians adding or substituting one drug at a time to existing regimens, rather than through a systematic search for synergistic drugs. \n\nThe regimen is unusually onerous, requiring six to eight months of therapy, said Dr. Marcus Horwitz, Distinguished Professor of Medicine and Microbiology, Immunology & Molecular Genetics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and the study's senior author. \n\n\"The lengthy course increases the likelihood of drug toxicity and often leads to poor patient adherence to the drug regimens, which in turn prompts the emergence of drug-resistant TB,\" he said. \"Drug-resistant TB, which requires up to two years to treat with current regimens, is difficult to treat and carries a high fatality rate.\" \n\nThe PRS technology can be applied to any disease and has been used in oncology, infectious diseases, immunosuppression and other areas in both the lab and the clinic, said Chih-Ming Ho, Distinguished Research Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, and principal investigator of this study. \n\n\"This makes it possible to identify the most effective drug and dose combinations to treat a disease by sampling a relatively small number of different drug-dose combinations among billions of possible combinations,\" Ho said. \"It greatly reduces the time and effort required to identify optimal drug combinations.\" \n\nIn a previous study, the researchers assessed the effectiveness of about 500 combinations of drugs and doses using a cell culture model. That enabled them to identify several highly synergistic three- and four-drug regimens that would likely be more potent than the standard regimen used to treat TB. \n\nIn the current study, the researchers first used the parabolic response surface approach to determine the optimal drug doses in mice for each of four drugs in two combinations. They then tested those combinations\u2014PRS Regimens I and II\u2014in mice infected with a highly virulent strain of M. tuberculosis. The PRS I and II regimens killed TB bacteria in the lungs and cured the mice up to four times faster than the standard regimen. To verify whether the animals were cured, treatment was halted after various treatment periods, and when a three-month waiting time elapsed, confirmation was made that the mice had no TB bacteria in their lungs. \n\nIf the new regimens are as successful in treating TB in humans as they were in mice, the much more effective of the two regimens, PRS Regimen II, made up of the drugs clofazimine, bedaquiline, ethambutol and pyrazinamide, would reduce treatment time by 75 percent\u2014from the six to eight months required under the standard regimen to about six weeks to two months. \n\n\"As a result, patients are more likely to adhere to the drug regimen, suffer less drug toxicity, and be less likely to develop drug-resistant TB,\" Horwitz said. \"The PRS regimens are also suitable for treating most cases of drug-resistant TB because they do not contain the two drugs to which people with the drug-resistant disease typically develop resistance. These cases are anticipated to be treatable as rapidly as drug-sensitive cases with the PRS regimens,\" he added. \n\nThe next step is to test the drug combinations in humans. A pilot study of PRS Regimen I has already begun; this regimen consists of generic drugs only, which was a requirement for this particular study. Preliminary results indicate that four months of treating drug-sensitive TB with this regimen would be at least as effective as six months of treatment with the standard regimen. In addition, in laboratory studies, the researchers are using the PRS analysis against a larger number of TB drugs, including experimental drugs not yet approved for human use, to try to identify even more potent regimens. \n\nMore information: Bai-Yu Lee et al.

I wasn\u2019t doing bad, but I haven\u2019t been doing as well as I\u2019d like to be. So being able to bowl a good series right before regionals, that\u2019s good.\u201d \n \nThere was an adjustment period for Bay as the lanes began to dry out in the afternoon. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m used to bowling in the morning when the lanes are oily and wet,\u201d Bay said, \u201cand then you get to the afternoon, things dry up, and we\u2019re not used to that. We have to adjust just as much as any other team does.\u201d \n \nThe Duchesses finished eighth as a team with a score of 5,478. Mackenzie Kavanaugh (1,145), Alyssa Bonnette (1,036) and Melissa Bates (990) also rolled six-game totals. \n \nOregon placed fifth as a team with a total pinfall of 5,556. Leading the way for the Hawks was Victoria Barnhart, who had a 6-game total of 1,216, good for ninth place overall. \n \nBarnhart rolled games of 183, 195 and 225 for a 603 morning series, then had 214, 207 and 192 for a 613 in the afternoon. \n \n\u201cI mostly kept it in the middle, because nobody was throwing there,\u201d Barnhart said. \u201cI really had to work on my arm swing to keep it straight, and really trust my ball to go out left, and not pull it.\u201d \n \nAbi Scheidecker (1,179), Ali Scheidecker (1,120) and Caitlyn Kaltenbrun (1,000) also had 6-game scores for the Hawks. \n \nSterling wound up 17th in the 22-team field with a score of 4,989. Leading the Golden Warriors was Kyleigh Glazier with a 6-game score of 1,122. She was backed by Hannah Stout (1,062), Zoey Paone (1,012) and Jamie Riley (956). \n \nLockport defended its team title with a total pinfall of 6,286, well ahead of runner-up Sycamore, which had 5,795. Guilford (5,594) and Moline (5,584) rounded out the top four teams. \n \nLockport has now won invitationals at Palatine, Prospect, Lockport, Plainfield North, Fenton and Dixon this season. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been all over,\u201d Porters coach Art Cwudzinski said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we go to a lot of different tournaments, so we are adapting to all of the different shots all over. They\u2019re really good at it. Our girls practice all the time, and they\u2019re reaping the results.\u201d \n \nLockport\u2019s Marissa Ramirez (1,313), Bailey Delrose (1,283) and Dana Ackerson (1,278) claimed spots 2-4 overall. They were looking up at Sycamore freshman Morgan Kolberg, who posted a 1,350 total. \n    \nKolberg, who also won her own team\u2019s invitational, rolled games of 193, 209 and 244 for a 646 morning series, then turned it up a notch with 256, 243 and 205 for a 704 afternoon series. \n \n\u201cI just had to stay calm, figure out the lanes, and make sure that I was throwing good, consecutive shots, and picking up my spares,\u201d Kolberg said. \n \nKolberg and the rest of the Spartans will return to Plum Hollow on Saturday to compete in the Oregon Regional, and she\u2019s brimming with confidence. The top four teams and 10 individuals not on those teams advance to the LaSalle-Peru Sectional on Saturday, Feb. 11. \n \n\u201cIt really does set a good tone,\u201d Kolberg said. \u201cI\u2019m kind of excited to go on, and hopefully make it to state as a team.\u201d \n \nTop 3 teams \n \n1.

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nassau","zipCode":"11758","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Massapequa","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Massapequa Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169689987","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Massapequa Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.massapequa.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695197500172","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:53:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22877259/20170128/091105/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1485654598-9499.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Loudoun","zipCode":"20166","state":"Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Sterling","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Hauppauge Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"340475371","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Hauppauge Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://hauppauge.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695197500348","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:53:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22877259/20170128/091105/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1485654598-9499.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

In 2009 testing for TB using molecular diagnostics proved a game-changer for national TB programmes. \n\nThe molecular diagnostics technology increased access to TB testing, which then improved diagnosis and treatment and ultimately inhibited further infection. However, when the World Health Organization endorsed this molecular diagnostic test, there was no quality assurance in place for checking the accuracy of the testing machine. \n\nA team of scientists from Wits, led by Prof. Wendy Stevens and Prof. Lesley Scott in the Department of Molecular Medicine and Haematology, in collaboration with Prof. Bavesh Kana from the Department of Science and Technology/National Research Foundation Centre of Excellence for Biomedical TB Research, developed TB Check technology. \n\nTB Check guarantees the quality of the molecular diagnostic tests. In South Africa, TB Check has been used on all 289 GeneXpert testing instruments in the national TB programme since 2011. Over a year, TB Check showed that 2.6% of the TB tests were inaccurate and that test modules needed replacing. \n\nIn the absence of TB Check, 78 000 test results out of the three million tests performed at the time would have been inaccurate, leading to an incorrect diagnosis. As a result, some patients would have remained undiagnosed and either died or infected others, while others would have been subjected to unnecessary, costly drugs with unpleasant side effects. \n\nThe Global Laboratory Initiative, an advisor to the WHO, has endorsed TB Check for verification. The technology was developed in collaboration with the Centres for Disease Control, which provided significant funding, the National Health Laboratory Services, which was responsible for the rollout of the new diagnostic programme in South Africa, and the AIDS Clinical Trial Group in the USA, which provided funding for testing in particular countries. \n\nTB Check was so successfully rolled out to local and international TB testing programmes at scale that Wits Enterprise \"spun out\" a new company, SmartSpot Quality (Pty) Ltd in 2015. TB Check has thus since been exported to 22 countries, with more in the pipeline. \n\nProvided by: Wits University \n\nExplore further \n\nInnovative HIV self-testing study empowers young women in rural South Africa \n\nNov 30, 2016 \n\nA Public Health research unit at Wits University is leading a study that enables young women in rural South Africa to test themselves for HIV. \n\nBetter diagnosis of fungal infections key to reducing antibiotic resistance \n\nJan 17, 2017 \n\nPoor diagnosis worldwide of fungal disease causes doctors to overprescribe antibiotics, increasing harmful resistance to antimicrobial drugs, according to a paper published today in Emerging Infectious Diseases. \n\nAssociation for Molecular Pathology establishes new standard for clinical utility of molecular Dx \n\nAug 17, 2016 \n\nThe Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), the premier global, non-profit organization serving molecular diagnostic professionals, today announced a new report that addresses the challenges in defining the clinical utility ... \n\nCheck-ups for cardiovascular disease should be targeted at a few high risk patients, study finds \n\nNov 08, 2016 \n\nA team of researchers led by the University of Birmingham have found that targeting as few as 1 in 12 adults for a heart check-up achieves most of the benefits of mass screening at a fraction of the cost. \n\nZika virus: Optimized tests for reliable diagnosis \n\nMay 12, 2016 \n\nDZIF scientists from the University of Bonn have shown that not all conventional Zika virus molecular diagnostic tests for are sufficiently reliable.

All participating individuals had to register by visiting www.bike2workmalta.eu to enter the chance of winning an e-Bike. Companies could also register to participate by encouraging their employees through incentives and events. \n \nBike2Work is supported by the European Cyclists\u2019 Federation, the umbrella association of European bicycle organisations. ECF is committed to being a resource centre for campaigns by giving long-term support and coordinating knowledge dissemination. \n \nBike2Work has 12 partners from Europe all with different experiences in bike-to-work campaigning. This pan-European approach offers great opportunities for know-how transfer and the combining of successful campaign elements from different campaigns. Bike2Work celebrates this diversity and the knowledge-exchange it encourages because it leads to more efficient and more successful campaigns. \n \n\u201cMore than the fact that the campaign managed to achieve its targets, the it stirred a national debate on how important and urgent it is to start considering alternative modes of transport to curb growing traffic and congestion problems. Traffic congestion and pollution have become a national problem and yet, although important solutions are possible, very few seem ready to start doing something about it,\u201d Mr Ward said. \n \n\u201cThrough our two-week campaign, Paragon Europe is proud to have done its part and introduced cycling as a doable transport alternative. We managed to raise awareness about the four benefits of choosing to cycle: reducing car pollution, contributing to a reduction in traffic, increasing physical activity and encouraging the creation of a wider mobility infrastructure,\u201d said Mr Ward, who also thanked campaign sponsor Magri Cycles. \n \nNorman Mifsud, chief officer, HR and corporate services, Mapfre MSV Life, said he was pleased that his company was declared the winning company of the Bike2Work campaign. \n \nHe said: \u201cAs a life insurance company we take on well-being initiatives related to exercise and nutrition and we participated in this because it is in line with the our values and efforts to encourage staff and clients to lead a healthy life. We are also aware of the current traffic situation in Malta and therefore biking to work could be a faster alternative for some employees.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Winners of Bike2Work campaign","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe","countryCode":"MT","country":"Malta"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Times of Malta","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660702","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"87"},"name":"Times of Malta","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.timesofmalta.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.bike2workmalta.eu/"],"sequenceId":"695197502717","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T23:01:15Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Credit: Koh et al., Hanyang University, S. KOREA. \n\nProteins produced by the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis may be involved in immune system processes that can help fight mycobacteria, according to a new study. The findings, published in PLOS Pathogens, suggest that these proteins could potentially play a role in new treatment strategies for tuberculosis. \n\nTuberculosis infects millions worldwide and kills over two million people each year, mostly in low-and middle-income countries. To improve treatment strategies, scientists have proposed the use of host-directed therapies, which target processes in the human body that help mycobacteria survive and thrive, rather than directly targeting the bacteria themselves. \n\nIn the new study, Hyun-Jung Koh and colleagues at Hanyang University in South Korea suggest that proteins produced by a different pathogen, the parasite that causes the disease toxoplasmosis, could play a role in the development of host-directed tuberculosis therapies. \n\nThe scientists reported that mycobacteria-infected mice and human cell lines were treated with recombinant GRA7 to investigate the activity of GRA7 proteins, which are produced by the parasites after they infect a host cell. They found that a host protein called PKCα is essential for interactions between GRA7 and host proteins known as ASC and PLD1. \n\nThese interactions are known to contribute to anti-tuberculosis defense mechanisms, suggesting the potential for development of GRA7-based host-directed tuberculosis therapies. However, this study was performed in mice and human cells, not in tuberculosis patients, and further research is needed to better understand the molecular role of GRA7 in humans. \n\nMore information: Koh H-J, Kim Y-R, Kim J-S, Yun J-S, Jang K, Yang C-S (2017) Toxoplasma gondii GRA7-Targeted ASC and PLD1 Promote Antibacterial Host Defense via PKCα.

The radio show was primarily focused on the fast approaching Class Tenth and Class Twelfth board exams and motivating students for the same. \n \nThe address was special because of the fact that it is the first one of the year. The Prime Minister particularly sought approval from the Election Commission of India to host the address, keeping in mind the crucial Assembly elections in five states, just a handful of days away. \n \nThe Election Commission had indeed, given clearance to the Prime minister to host this episode of \u2018Mann Ki Baat\u2019 it was on the condition that the subject of the elections would not be broached. Highlighting the point, the commission had informed the Information & Broadcasting Ministry, that there would be nothing in the address  \u201cthat might act as inducement to voters.\u201d \n Key Highlights of this month\u2019s Mann Ki Baat:  The Prime Minister proposes a two-minute silence for martyred soldiers at 11:00 AM on January 30th. He also congratulated all soldiers that have won awards this Republic Day.  Narendra Modi asked students to research the Jawans who have won awards this Republic day and write two lines about them on social media. He further asked the youth to tag their friends to extend awareness.  The Prime Minister addressed the fears of students, teachers and parents in view of the coming exams. The Prime Minister said that the country needs to get out of the anxiousness that exams seem to generate.  Saying that many students have sent across messages from all parts of the country, the Prime Minister said that exams should be a pleasure and not a pressure. It should be a festival of showing off the achievements that students have accomplished throughout the year.  \u201cI request parents to celebrate this period as a festival. Put in a team effort as a family, to generate a positive atmosphere,\u201d said the Prime Minister. He added the slogan, \u201cSmile more, Score more.\u201d  The Prime Minister said that exams do not test your life. They are just a test of what has been learnt through the year. He said low scores are not an indication of failure in life. Modi added that exams are not a matter of life or death.  Giving the example of APJ Abdul Kalam, the Prime Minister asked students whether if the former President had given up after failing to get into the NDA, he would have made such a successful scientist.  \u201cIf your focus is only on marks, you will not be able to gain knowledge,\u201d said the Prime Minister. He further asked students to introspect and go after their ambitions. If that is done, marks will follow he said.  Giving the example of Sachin Tendulkar, the Prime Minister said introspection is the best way to go forward in life. Competing with oneself is the best way to push oneself forward, not competition. Highlighting the ills of comparing oneself with others, the Prime Minister said that it limits one\u2019s capabilities of reaching greater heights.  The Prime Minister said that parents and mentors play a crucial role in the success of students. He said that women in the family are particularly concerned with the performance of their children. However, he asked them to accept realities as they are. He said, \u201cWe often debate the weight of school children\u2019s bags. I, however, feel that the weight of mentors\u2019 expectations are more heavy for children than their bags.\u201d  Broaching the subject of cheating in exams, the Prime Minister said, \u201cTo cheat is to be cheap. So please do not cheat.\u201d He added that once you get used to cheating, you will never be able to reach anywhere in life. There are some people who spend their entire creativity in devising ways to cheat. If the same creativity is spent on ways to study you will have a wonderful exam, he added.  \u201cThere is a life outside books,\u201d said the Prime Minister. \u201cIf anyone says this is not the time to explore life, they are wrong. The life of a student is the best period to mould one\u2019s life,\u201d he expounded.  Proper rest, exercise and sleep are crucial for giving a crucial exam, said Modi. Mental relaxation is crucial for a good performance. He also asked students to look at the stars, the trees, take a deep breath, you will study with new vigour,\u201d  Narendra Modi emphasised on the role that proper sleep plays in fulfilling one\u2019s tasks. Throwing in humour, he said, \u201cbut don\u2019t keep sleeping all the time saying that the Prime Minister asked ou to do so. Otherwise, when your results come, your parents will only see me in their mind.\u201d  1 February 2017, the Indian Coast Guard will complete 40 years. the Prime Minister congratulated the jawans and sailors for the achievement. 1st February is also the day of Vasant Panchami, it is a great festival. \u201cI also extend greetings for this great festival,\u201d Narendra Modi said.  \nIn more than two years of \u2018Mann Ki Baat\u2019 being in existence, the Prime Minister has broached many issues of social, economic and political importance, seeking to generate awareness in every corner of India. In the past, some of the issues that the Prime Minister has raised include, supporting indigenous goods, cleanliness, drug abuse, parenting, the safety of women, issues relating to girl children, farmers\u2019 problems, employment, terrorism and demonetisation among others.Apart from today, the Prime Minister has in the past two years too, tried to allay the fears of students before the commencement of the board examinations. \n \nThe last episode of the show, held on the 26th of December, was the second one after the introduction of the government\u2019s demonetisation policy. Promising to carry forward the war against corruption and black money the Prime Minister had then said, \u201cI assure you that this is not the end. This is just the beginning in our fight against corruption. We have to win this war against corruption and black money. There is no question of stopping or going back in this fight.\u201d  (ALSO READ: PM Narendra Modi hails nation for embracing demonetisation ) \n \nThe programme was broadcast at 11:00 AM today on the entire network of All India Radio, Doordarshan and the Narendra Modi App this morning. However, Akashvani too will be broadcasting the show in regional languages. There will also be a repeat broadcast of the same at 8 PM. The audio clip of today\u2019s Mann Ki Baat will also be available on the youtube channels of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and All India Radio. Also, a missed call can be given on 1922 to hear the Mann Ki Baat episode on mobile phones. \n \n[embedded content]","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Mann Ki Baat: Narendra Modi motivates students with slogan \u2018smile more, score more\u2019; 15 Key Highlights 2 hours ago","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"India.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597540856","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"India.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.india.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197511107","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

won\u2019t be good enough. \n \nThe Bank of England governor, overseeing an economy recording solid expansion and accelerating inflation, will probably raise near term projections for both this week, according to economists. At the same time, he may highlight potential longer-term threats from Brexit that may damp any speculation about tighter policy. \n \nIt\u2019s a delicate balancing act for Carney, who spent much of 2016 fending off accusations he was being far too gloomy about the economy. While inflation will breach the BOE\u2019s 2 percent target within months, the Monetary Policy Committee has indicated it\u2019s keeping its emphasis on supporting growth for now, a trade-off that may become more challenging if the economy keeps up its current momentum. \n  \n\u201cOn the face of it, the inflation forecast and the fairly resilient growth performance argues for a more hawkish message,\u201d said Sam Hill, an economist at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cBut given the headwinds that are approaching related to Brexit, it\u2019s likely the MPC will spend some time making clear just how much room they\u2019ve got to look through a period of inflation being above target.\u201d \n \nEconomists predict the BOE will keep its key interest rate at a record-low 0.25 percent and leave the size of its quantitative-easing program unchanged on Feb. 2. In August, officials announced a 60 billion-pound ($75 billion) expansion of their gilt-purchase plan, a round of bond buying that is set to expire in February. \n Fed, BOJ  \nSince their last forecasts in November, the pound has stopped falling and the economy has maintained its 0.6 percent pace of quarterly expansion. Another bright spot may be a stronger global backdrop. The Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan also announce policy decisions next week. \n \nAll but two out of 19 economists in the Bloomberg survey see the MPC raising its growth forecast for this year, while the majority see the panel also raising its inflation projection. However, most see the bank leaving its estimates for next year unchanged. \n \nThree months ago, Carney said the bank\u2019s next rate move could be up or down. U.K. consumer-price growth rate jumped to 1.6 percent in December, and some economists see it reaching as much as 3 percent this year, well above target. That\u2019s prompted traders to raise bets on an interest-rate increase this year. \n  \nThe most important business stories of the day. \n \nGet Bloomberg's daily newsletter. \n     \nPolitics \n \nThe latest political news, analysis, charts, and dispatches from Washington. \n  You will now receive the Politics newsletter     \nMarkets \n \nThe most important market news of the day.

U.K. companies from BT Group Plc to Whitbread Plc have warned about the outlook, while U.S. President Donald Trump has raised the specter of trade wars. Economists don\u2019t see the MPC changing tack any time soon, with Bloomberg surveys showing no policy change until at least 2019. \n\u201cThe messaging we get may well be taken as hawkish,\u201d said Liz Martins, U.K. economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in London. \u201cHowever, we are not persuaded that the MPC is yet in hawkish mode.\u201d \n \nThe meeting will be the last for Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking Minouche Shafik before she leaves to become director of the London School of Economics. The Treasury has yet to announce her replacement.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Scott Hamilton"},"topics":[{"name":"Central banks news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Bank of England news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Better Forecasts Not Enough for Carney in Brexit's Long Shadow","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Bloomberg","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169706194","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"15671"},"name":"Bloomberg","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bloomberg.com","publisher":"Bloomberg"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197512775","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iogXjz1J9_vk/v0/1200x-1.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He's one of the staff members, part of an increasingly grey workforce in an increasingly grey country. \n\n\"I enjoy talking to the people here. It's fun, but it's also hard work,\" Odaira said during a break from his caregiving duties on a recent day. \n\nJapan is considered a \"super-aging\" society. More than a quarter of the population is over 65, a figure set to rise to 40 percent by 2050. The average life expectancy is 85, and that means many Japanese remain relatively healthy for a good two decades after retirement age. \n\nAt the same time, the birthrate has plummeted to well below the level needed to keep the population stable. Now home to 128 million people, Japan is expected to number less than 100 million by 2050, according to government projections. \n\nThat means authorities need to think about ways to keep seniors healthy and active for longer, but also about how to augment the workforce to cope with labor shortages. \n\nEnter the septuagenarian caregiver. \n\nAt Cross Heart, more than half of the 119 caregivers are over 60, and 15 of them are over 70. \n\n\"When we advertise for people to work here, we get lots of responses from older people, not younger people,\" said nursing home director Kaori Yokoo in the lobby where residents were doing leg curls and chest presses on weight machines. \n\nThe foundation that runs this nursing home and others in Kanagawa Prefecture has raised the official retirement age to 70 but allows employees to keep working until 80 if they want to and can. Municipalities around the country are also actively recruiting people over 60 to do lighter duties at nursing homes. \n\nIt's one way of dealing with the problem. Meanwhile, researchers are working on robots that can lift the elderly out of beds and wheelchairs, and inward-looking Japan is slowly coming around to the idea that it may need to allow in more foreign workers. \n\nAlthough older workers have constraints - some can't do the heavier tasks - they also offer advantages over younger workers who want time off for their children, said Yokoo, who is 41. \n\n\"Plus, because they're close in age to the residents, they can relate to each other more,\" she said. \"We younger people think this must be nice for them. Older staff can understand things like physical pains more because they are living through the same things.\" \n\nSome of the older workers here are doing it because they need the money. For others, the money is a nice benefit, but the main motivation is the activity and sense of community. \n\nKiyoko Tsuboi, a 95-year-old who comes into the rest home during the day, said she likes having Odaira around. \n\n\"He's very attentive to our needs and knows things like how hot we like our tea. My son is not as kind as Odaira-san,\" Tsuboi said as Odaira cleared away the lunch dishes. \"He's quite active despite his age, and even though he's a man, he has an eye for detail.\" Ad Feedback The dynamic works well for Odaira, too, who started here 17 years ago after retiring from his job in the sales department of an auto parts maker. He works eight hours a day, four days a week. \n\nHis father died when he was small, his mother when he was 22. \"It's not like I'm replacing my mother, but I thought I could help someone else's parents,\" he said. \n\nHe also does it to stay young, Odaira said with a twinkle in his eye. \"I think it's good for me physically and mentally, so as long as I can keep working, I will.\" \n\nHe's not the oldest worker here, though. That title is shared by two 78-year-olds, a man who works in the office, and Noriko Fukuju, who helps with pickups and drop-offs and does activities with \"the old people.\" \n\n\"It's fun. I enjoy it,\" she said. \n\nHiroko Akiyama, at the University of Tokyo's Institute of Gerontology, said a Japanese 65-year-old is in much better physical and mental shape than a 65-year-old a few decades ago. \"They are full of energy, and healthy and long-living,\" she said. \n\nAkiyama's research has found that working helps keep seniors that way. \"They operate on a regular schedule. They wake up, get ready, go to work and talk to people and stay connected,\" she said. \"We had a depressed old woman who changed completely after she started working.\" \n\nStill, Japan can't rely solely on seniors or, potentially, robots to staff its nursing homes, where the need will only grow as the population ages, analysts say. \n\nJapan has agreements with Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines under which applicants who complete job training and pass a Japanese language test can work at a Japanese nursing home. \n\nBut if they want to stay beyond three years, they must pass a national caregiver's exam so difficult that 40 percent of Japanese applicants fail. Many Japanese also express concern about cultural differences. \n\nNext year, the Japanese government will loosen the regulations slightly and set up a technical intern program, but there will still be time limits and difficult tests to pass. \n\nPerhaps 2,000 people will come to Japan through the intern program, said Yasuhiro Yuki, an expert on elderly care at Shukutoku University. \"But we hear we will need 300,000 more caregivers in the next 10 years,\" he said. \"So I still don't think we will have enough.\" \n\nThat means aging caregivers will increasingly become the norm. \n\n\"I can do this at least for two more years,\" said Fukuju, the 78-year-old, before she dashed out the door to renew her driver's licence.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ANNA FIFIELD"},"topics":[{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Staff in rest homes as grey as the residents","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Manawatu Standard","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169677392","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Manawatu Standard","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197516887","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:46Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://static2.stuff.co.nz/1485675188/120/17272120.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Worryingly for Federer, three of these were on hard courts, including the 2014 Australian Open semi-final. \n \nSwiss maestro Federer had defeated compatriot Wawrinka in the first semi-final on Thursday to enter the final that will be held at Melbourne Park on Sunday. \n \nThe ninth-seeded Spaniard fought off two break points in the eighth game of the fifth set, then hit a backhand victor down the line to break Dimitrov in the next game and take a 5-4 lead. As the clock ticked past midnight and the match approached its fifth hour, Nadal drew on all his experience to prise a break in the ninth game and a chance to serve for the match . \n \nThe big takeaway is Federer gets the extra day off to recover any adductor, as he says, issues he has and luckily for Roger it wasn't that long of a match nor that physical. \n \n\"We never thought that we had the chance to be, again, in a final, and especially in the first of the year\", Nadal said. I saw him (Federer) with a youthful attitude. \n \nFederer has won the Australian Open four times , the last being in 2010. After losing his previous four 2006 meetings with Nadal, Federer dominated at the All England club over four sets to register his fourth consecutive Wimbledon title. The 14-time grand slam winner's familiar muscular groundstrokes continued to heap pressure on his younger opponent, playing in only his second slam semi. \n \nThe record - 23-11 in Rafa's favour and a one-sided 9-2 in grand slam events - would suggest Roger should be on bended knee, praying that Grigor Dimitrov takes out his nemesis, as Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray were conveniently removed. Four of those losses came at Roland Garros, and, speaking immediately following his win over Wawrinka, Federer admitted that he may have allowed those early battles on Nadal's favored surface of clay to dictate the tone of their rivalry. \n \nThirty-year-old Nadal, who was pushed all the way in a five-set match against German teenager Alex Zverev in the third round, disagreed that it was getting easier for the old guard at the grand slams. \n \nHe was almost undone here by Dimitrov, who came within a whisker of reaching his first major final and showed why many still consider him to be a multiple champion of the future. \n \nThe 2008 five-set epic final at Wimbledon is regarded by many as the best ever tennis match . \"I worked hard to try to make that happen\", Nadal said. \"And I know he's leading in Grand Slam finals but I can push that aside\". Nadal looked to be the favourite heading to the final set after taking the fourth 6-2, but Federer proved his quality by taking the decider 6-2. More importantly, Nadal has won the French Open nine times . \n \nThe victory at Rod Laver Arena also ensured Serena Williams will regain the top ranking, which she lost in September after 186 straight weeks when Angelique Kerber won the U.S. Open.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Rafa Nadal survives epic to set up dream Federer final","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"South America","countryCode":"VE","country":"Venezuela"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Equilibrio Informativo","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"570998171","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Equilibrio Informativo","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://equilibrioinformativo.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197517910","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n\nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n\nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n\nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n\nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n\n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n\n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n\nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n\n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n\n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n\n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n\n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n\nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n\n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n\n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n\n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"NewsMail","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662480","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"11"},"name":"NewsMail","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news-mail.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197518523","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557687z1_20170129162619_000g9dg4eu82-0-5o7dbx25uooe6wninn2_ct300x300.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Trouble is, such a tax risks scaring off banks looking for a new jurisdiction just as the U.K. prepares to leave the 28-nation European Union. \n \nThe proposal failed to garner the required unanimous support of EU governments and was revived in late 2012 by a smaller group under European \u201cenhanced cooperation\u201d rules that depend on the participation of at least nine member states. More than four years on, amid worries about the the FTT\u2019s economic and political side effects, 10 signatory countries, including Austria, France, Slovakia and Germany, have kept the idle plan on a drip feed. \n \nEvery missed deadline produces political declarations of incremental progress and a new timeline. A December 2015 meeting aimed at sealing an agreement ended in disarray, with an 11th member of the group -- Estonia -- abandoning the project. A missed mid-2016 target date rolled into later in the year, and when that wasn\u2019t realized the European Commission pledged a fresh legislative proposal by the middle of 2017. \n \nThat timetable keeps the FTT on the official EU agenda through France\u2019s presidential election scheduled for April 23 and May 7. In France, the ruling Socialists under outgoing President Francois Hollande support the FTT plan. \n \nMerkel, running for re-election on Sept. 24, is hemmed in by her junior coalition partners, the Social Democrats, who are firm backers of a European FTT. \n \nFor the leaders in both countries, trapped by their pledges to pursue the tax at European level, continued work on the plan offers political cover. \n \nTo read about how the FTT complicates banks\u2019 post-Brexit plans, click here \n \nWhile the European election season provides oxygen to the initiative, the scope for keeping it artificially alive for much longer may be choked off by a more recent financial development: the U.K.\u2019s decision to leave the EU. With Frankfurt and Paris seeking to lure banking business from London before Brexit in 2019, pursuing the FTT -- even for purely domestic political purposes -- could dissuade financial firms from relocating to a jurisdiction that has the tax. \n  \nThe most important business stories of the day. \n \nGet Bloomberg's daily newsletter. \n     \nPolitics \n \nThe latest political news, analysis, charts, and dispatches from Washington. \n  You will now receive the Politics newsletter     \nMarkets \n \nThe most important market news of the day.

And his Austrian counterpart, Hans Joerg Schelling, who chairs the group, canceled a Jan. 26 meeting on the FTT in Brussels because of more pressing domestic business. \n\u201cProgress is achievable\u201d and \u201ctechnically we will be moving,\u201d Slovak Finance Minister Peter Kazimir told Bloomberg News in Brussels the following day. \u201cBut this year we are waiting for so many outcomes.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"European banking news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Banking news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Tax news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"European Union news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Belgium news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"France news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Germany news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Global news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"EU\u2019s \u2018Dead\u2019 Bank-Tax Plan Lives on in German, French Elections","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Bloomberg","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169706194","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"15671"},"name":"Bloomberg","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bloomberg.com","publisher":"Bloomberg"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197521472","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iNja_UUgGacs/v0/1200x-1.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

I feel very happy, I enjoyed it a lot. \n \nNadal won through to his fourth Australian Open and his 21st Grand Slam final. Nadal faced an extremely tricky draw also, having to rally from two sets to one down against Alexander Zverev in the 3rd round, the German eventually succumbing to cramp in the latter stages. \n \nThe Williams, who have dominated women's tennis since the dawn of the millennium, will also become the oldest female pairing in a Grand Slam final at a combined 71 years. \n \nEither Federer, 35, will expand his record haul of major singles titles with his 18th, or 30-year-old Nadal will close the gap on the Swiss legend by winning his 15th. \n \nFederer was watching on with relish as his rival in Sunday's final was taken the distance in a draining physical battle. \n \nAnd now, the dream final tennis fans had hoped for when favourites Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic were upset in the first week is going to happen Sunday night in Rod Laver Arena. \n \nHe came out firing, with an ace, but had to dig deep to stave off two break points in his opening two service games. \n \nA brilliant backhand pass down the line, followed by a Dimitrov double fault, saw Nadal break back in the seventh game. \n \nNadal has already proved that from the baseline he is king, and the missiles that he launches from there will whiz past the stretched racquet of Federer. \n \nThe match turned quickly for Wawrinka as Federer raced to a two sets lead after holding three set points. \n \n\"It's exciting for both of us that we are still there and fighting for important events\", said Nadal. \n \nThere was a danger that the tie break loss could have taken its toll on Dimitrov's game but the 25-year-old continued to take the fight to Nadal in the fourth . \n \nThis was when the nostalgia started to get serious, as the two most credible threats to a Federer-Nadal final were now out of the way.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Rafa, Roger have mutual respect ahead of final","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"South America","countryCode":"VE","country":"Venezuela"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Equilibrio Informativo","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"570998171","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Equilibrio Informativo","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://equilibrioinformativo.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://lerepublique.com/2017/01/day-8-australian-open-matches-to-watch/","http://bsccomment.com/2017/01/28/nadal-to-play-federer-in-australian-open-final-after.html"],"sequenceId":"695197524804","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

Smith is mistrustful of what she calls the mainstream media, particularly those elements she believes are biased towards the left. As Kirralie Smith sits at a sidewalk table in Taree for an interview this week, there is a palpable tension. She is mistrustful of what she calls the mainstream media, particularly those elements she believes are biased towards the left. But Smith has agreed to talk because she will, she says, use any platform to express her view that Islam is an ideology of violence, intolerance and sexism.\n\nSmith received relatively little attention during the last federal election as a NSW Senate candidate for the Australian Liberty Alliance, the political offshoot of the Q Society, which describes itself as \"Australia's leading Islam-critical movement\".\n\n(\"Q Society supports an integrated multi-ethnic Australia and rejects racism, which the Oxford dictionary defines as: 'Belief in the superiority of a particular race.' Since Islam is not a race or ethnicity, being critical of Islam is not racist,\" its website explains.)\n\nBut she is likely to receive far more press in the coming weeks as the co-defendant in a defamation action being brought by the businessman Mohammed El-Mouelhy, who was the subject of a critical video produced by the Q Society and presented by Smith.\n\nAlready Smith and the Q Society, also named in the suit, have rallied an impressive line-up of public supporters, including Coalition right-wingers Cory Bernardi, George Christensen and the former MP Ross Cameron, who are among a handful of public figures set to address fundraisers to be held in Sydney and Melbourne on February 9 and 10.\n\nWe sit and both reach for our phones to turn on recording apps. Smith has already explained that she wants her own record of our conversation. The tension dissipates \u2013 a little \u2013 when a sky-blue ute throbs past us and Smith laughs and points out the personalised number plate, \"TRUMP1\". Later she will tell me that she rejects the suggestion she is right wing, rather, she says she a part of the silent majority of mainstream conservatives whose voices are now being heard due to victories of Donald Trump and the Brexit campaign.\n\nSmith says she never intended to pursue politics. She has always been happiest as a wife and mother. \"I love being my husband's wife,\" she says to emphasise the point.\n\nAs it was, a confluence of events brought her to her mission. In 2000 Smith and her husband Greg, a tradesman, sought out volunteer work in Mali and there met the Assemblies of God missionary Faouzi Arzouni, whom she describes as a Muslim apostate who became a friend and mentor.\n\nTwo years later the couple went on another trip, a 10-day visit to refugee camps of the displaced of what is now known as the Maluku sectarian conflict in Indonesia, during which Christian and Muslim communities fell into violent political and ethnic conflict. Smith recalls sitting in refugee camps hearing terrible stories of violence perpetrated by Muslims.\n\nIn 2009 Smith's husband took her to a talk being given by the Q Society's Mark Durie, an Anglican vicar. During that lecture Durie said that his wife would not buy certain supermarket products because they had been certified as halal.\n\nSmith was intrigued and began her own investigations on the internet, learning that many brands are halal-certified, and that a portion of the fees paid for such certification is donated to Muslim charities. In other countries, Smith contends, those charities have directed funds towards groups with terrorist links. Her online investigation became a website, Halal Choices, a campaign and, with the support of Bernardi and Christensen, a parliamentary inquiry into \"third party\" food certification. Finally it became a political ambit, with Smith running for the ALA in a campaign launched by the anti-Islamic immigration Dutch MP Geert Wilders.\n\n\"There is no question of our country being Islamified. Now, this reply constituted a historical error as soon as it was uttered,\" Wilders once told Dutch parliament.\n\n\"I can report that they have had enough of burkas, headscarves, the ritual slaughter of animals, so\u2011called honour revenge, blaring minarets, female circumcision, hymen restoration operations, abuse of homosexuals, Turkish and Arabic on the buses and trains as well as on town hall leaflets, halal meat at grocery shops and department stores, Sharia exams, the Finance Minister's Sharia mortgages, and the enormous over-representation of Muslims in the area of crime, including Moroccan street terrorists,\" Wilders said.\n\nSmith says she does not believe there is an imminent threat of adopting Sharia law, but is concerned about what she calls \"creeping sharia\".\n\n\"We are being encouraged very strongly to tolerate sharia finance, halal certification, the hijab,\" she says.\n\n\"Sharia is definitely present in Australia \u2026 I believe there are honour killings and it is all reported under domestic violence or another name,\" she says. As evidence she says she has close friends who are pastors who work in churches who have provided sanctuary to victims.\n\nBut Smith's concerns are broader than creeping sharia. During the US election she was horrified by Hillary Clinton's support for abortion rights. She opposes political correctness, Safe Schools and big government regulations imposed upon farmers by distant bureaucrats.\n\n\"I pretty much oppose everything the Greens stand for,\" she says.\n\nShe was also appalled by the Liberal Party's abandonment of Tony Abbott for Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nThis broader political outlook, and Smith's articulate direct manner, has led some observers to speculate that she is a potential leader for a new conservative movement, one energised by the international populist surge.\n\nShe is, says John Adams, a former Coalition adviser who has written about the need for more intellectual depth in the new conservative movement, a more capable and charismatic messenger than, say, Pauline Hanson. (\"I think Pauline has a lot of good sentiment, I am not sure about the ability,\" says Smith of Hanson.)\n\nIn the months since the campaign Smith has kept in touch with supporters via videos on her Facebook page. In them she is relentlessly bright and articulate, upbeat about Christmas and Australia Day, though scandalised by the recent billboard that showed a pair of little girls celebrating in a hijab and cheerily opposed to the \"threat\" of multiculturalism. She denies ever having had media training, though confesses that she is constantly asked if she has.\n\nAsked if she plans to run for office again Smith says she cannot answer the question as her entire focus is directed towards the defamation action and her family.\n\n\"People say this is sexist, well I am sexist, I love being a wife and mother, that is the best I have ever done in my life\u2026 I love being my husband's wife.\"\n\nIn the next breath she adds that she and her husband have made the decision to use any platform to put forward their message.\n\n\"I want to be able to look my children in the eye and say I did everything I could to stand for what is right.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Nick O&#39;Malley"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Islam-critical Kirralie Smith seen as potential libertarian leader","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2153","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Bella Vista","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Parramatta Sun","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169713624","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Parramatta Sun","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.parramattasun.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197531234","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:50:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/157221b2-f74a-469e-b91c-c9863ca767f7.jpg/r3_0_725_408_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect.

But the continuing prospect of a funding freeze for grants and contracts of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, threatens to \"disrupt core operations ranging from toxic clean-ups to water quality testing\", according to ProPublica, a non-profit news organisation. \n\nConcerns began to surface last Monday, 23 January, as word spread across social media that the Trump administration had ordered a number of federal agencies, including the US departments of interior and agriculture, to put a halt to press releases, posting on social media or publishing blogs. \n\nSeparately, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, withdrew from longtime plans to co-host a conference on climate change \u2013 something Trump during his campaign had said was \"created by and for the Chinese\" to challenge US competitiveness. \n\nThe EPA, which currently oversees about US$6.4 billion in federal contracts, many of them affiliated with universities, appears to be the primary target for the freezes. Relying primarily on anonymous tips and leaked reports, news reports last week pieced together a number of developments since Trump's inauguration on 20 January. \n\nAxios, a relatively new online publication, on Monday reported details of an EPA 'agency action' plan, including a section titled \"Addendum on the Problems with Research and Economic Analysis to Justify its Action\". \n\nThe plan, Axios said, suggests the Trump team wants to cut US$815 million from the agency\u2019s budget. State and tribal assistance grants, climate programmes and other \u201cenvironment programmes and management\u201d are among initiatives that are under review, it reported. \n\nProPublicaconfirmed the freeze on EPA grants and contracts in an interview with Myron Ebell, who led the EPA transition for the incoming administration. Ebell, who last week returned to his position directing energy and global warming policy at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, downplayed the significance of the action. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to freeze things to make sure nothing happens they don\u2019t want to have happen, so any regulations going forward, contracts, grants, hires, they want to make sure to look at them first,\u201d he said. \u201cThis may be a little wider than some previous administrations, but it\u2019s very similar to what others have done.\u201d ProPublica said it was not clear whether the freeze affects only new grants and contracts or all existing ones. \n\nEbell, in an interview published on Friday by Bloomberg Markets, said the EPA has \"gotten away with murder in misusing science and justifying regulations on the basis of junk science\u201d, and that its employees should be cut to 5,000, about one-third of the current number. Ebell stressed that he was not speaking for Trump or the new administration. \n\nAlso last Monday, Huffington Post published contents of a memo that had reportedly been sent to EPA staff imposing restrictions on press releases, social media or blogs. The memo also asked staffers to list external speaking engagements, barred them from putting new content on the website and said it will review other forms of communication, including messages posted on listservs. \n\nReuters reported that the administration on Tuesday had demanded that the EPA delete all of its pages on climate change. The Hill later quoted an EPA spokesman who said the directive should not be viewed as a gag order. The agency is \"looking at scrubbing it up a bit, putting a little freshener on it, and getting it back up to the public\", he said. \"We're taking a look at everything on there.\" As of Saturday, issues related to climate change still had a presence on the website. \n\nConcern for scientific community \n\nThe Trump administration's approach to climate change has been an ongoing concern for the scientific community. In December, leaders of dozens of non-profit organisations published a letter urging Trump to appoint a science adviser who supports evidence-based research, and offered to help with the selection process. \n\nThey were not consulted on Trump's pick to become the next head of the EPA, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt. \n\nPruitt, whose nomination has not been confirmed, said during his confirmation hearing that he does not believe global warming is taking place at a catastrophic rate and that humans are to blame. On Tuesday, Tom Carper, a Democrat and ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said: \"Serious questions remain about the nominee's record and vision for the agency he seeks to lead.\" \n\nReaction to the events of the week arrived in various forms: \n\nAfter the US National Park Service was ordered to stop posting on social media, a group describing itself as the Unofficial #Resistance created a non-censored feed, @AltNatParkSer. \n\nFormer vice president Al Gore announced he would co-host the climate change conference along with co-sponsors, including the Harvard Global Health Institute and the American Public Health Association. The association had been organising the event with the CDC. \n\nScientists around the country began planning to protest Trump's anti-science stance in Washington with the hope of sparking a grassroots movement reminiscent of the 21 January Women's March on Washington, which drew record crowds the day after Trump's inauguration. \n\n\"There are certain things that we accept as facts with no alternatives,\" says a statement from the Scientists' March on Washington, which was posted on a recently created website. \n\n\"Politicians who devalue expertise risk making decisions that do not reflect reality and must be held accountable. An American government that ignores science to pursue ideological agendas endangers the world.\" \n\nOrganisers said they would provide details and updates by Monday 30 January.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Climate change news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump to tighten control of research and dissemination","source":{"category":"Academic","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"University World News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170171644","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"958"},"name":"University World News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.universityworldnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197536604","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-27T15:42:54Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Out of these, about 200 academic libraries are located in North African universities. \n\nScholarship \n\nRelatively speaking, the scholarly contributions of Arab-world librarians are low. According to a 2015 report entitled Scholarly Productivity of Arab Librarians in Library and Information Science Journals from 1981 to 2010: An analytical study , librarians from Arab countries authored only 12.9% of all articles published in sample journals from 1981 to 2010. Most productive Arab countries were located in North Africa, and included Egypt and Algeria. \n\nAccording to Ian Johnson, chief editor at the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions based in the Netherlands, Arab countries in North Africa face a range of differing political, economic and social challenges. \n\n\"Those challenges are reflected in the circumstances of each country\u2019s universities and its libraries, but few could probably claim to enjoy the same status as libraries in the best universities in the world,\" he told University World News . \n\nAccording to Johnson, many Arab universities are relatively new and therefore neither the universities nor their libraries are fully developed. \n\nBesides the unfamiliarity of students with libraries, resulting in less effective use of them, teaching methods in the universities might also not encourage students to undertake independent reading and develop critical reasoning. \n\nLimited use \n\nSome universities do not focus on research, which also means the number of faculty using the library is limited. All of this means that many libraries in the Arab world are not being used to their full potential, said Johnson. \n\nIn addition, library staff may not be sufficiently familiar with the disciplines taught in the university because they studied librarianship as undergraduates rather than commencing librarian studies at postgraduate level, he said. \n\nHowever, \"addressing problems facing North Africa's academic libraries will be complex\", he said. \u201cThey are not independent of each other; some are inter-dependent. Most require a lead to be taken by a country\u2019s government. That would require a case to be made that making the changes should be a political and economic priority.\u201d \n\nAccording to Sherif Kamel Shaheen, professor of library and information science at Cairo University, cooperation has been pursued by some Arab academic libraries through the formation of national-level consortia or alliances. \n\nThese national consortia include the Egyptian Universities Libraries Consortium , Tunisian Library of Academic Resources , Algerian Consortium of Higher Education and Scientific Research Establishments , and the Sudanese Universities Library Consortium . \n\nSavings \n\nThe consortia provide universities with an umbrella organisation through which to negotiate with publishers on various legal and financial issues, resulting in significant savings in money and effort, Shaheen said. \n\nThey also bridge the gap between emerging and established universities, allowing emerging universities to access the same services as major universities, he said. \n\nAccording to Shaheen, North African academic library consortia would help university libraries to eliminate overlap and duplication of resources and efforts, which would facilitate optimum methods for effectively and efficiently using the allocated resources. \n\n\"The central management of constantly updated content could be shared for the benefit of all universities. Access to such, often costly, resources would also enhance the academic status of universities,\u201d he said. \n\nHowever, despite the cost benefits of setting up consortia among North Africa university libraries, several challenges remain. \n\nChallenges \n\nMagdi Tawfik Abdelhamid, a professor at Cairo's National Research Centre who obtained his PhD from the Japan-based Gifu University, said: \"Besides the lack of adequate policies for partnerships among academic libraries and funding sources in the region, North Africa's universities need to gain technical experience in consortium management, marketing and assessment along with developing scientific expertise to promote effective utilisation of e-resources offered by the consortia.\u201d \n\nAcademic libraries located in North Africa's universities should not \"reinvent the wheel\" but learn international best practice from universities worldwide, Abdelhamid told University World News . \n\nAnd academic libraries in countries such as Egypt where the German University of Cairo, the British University of Egypt and the American University of Cairo were based, had an opportunity to engage with international universities' branch campus libraries, according to Alicia Salaz, reference and instruction librarian, at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar. \n\n\u201cThe physical proximity of international branch campus libraries and their host country counterparts is an opportunity for practitioners in both settings to engage in mutual professional development and knowledge exchange,\" she told University World News .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Cooperation - The magic word for academic libraries","source":{"category":"Academic","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"University World News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170171644","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"958"},"name":"University World News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.universityworldnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://melib.web.unc.edu/files/2015/10/Kurzman_Mellon_Project_Report_2015_10_16.pdf","http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.851.7711&rep=rep1&type=pdf","http://www.eul.edu.eg/Home.aspx","http://www.biruni.tn/","http://www.eifl.net/country/algeria","http://www.eifl.net/country/sudan"],"sequenceId":"695197537136","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-27T16:02:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They're mentally tough as well. They always kept going. \n \n\"It's something that I learned from them a lot, is how to hopefully do the same, which hopefully I've been able to do.\" \n \nWilliams had been reluctant to talk about records in Melbourne to keep the pressure off, but she is now ready to acknowledge her standing as one of the greatest women players of all time, if not the greatest. \n \n\"I definitely think so. I mean, between Martina, myself, Steffi Graf, hands down we are leading that conversation,\" she said. \n \nHer achievement took 19 long years from her Grand Slam debut as a 17-year-old in Melbourne in 1998, and she is not ready to stop just yet. \n \nBut she insists there are no new goals, despite Court's 24 titles being within reach. \n \n\"I never had a number. That's the beauty of it,\" she said. \n \n\"When I started this journey, I just wanted to win a Grand Slam. Then I just wanted to win. Every time I step on the court, I want to win.\" \n \nAnd in an ominous sign that there is still more to come, she added: \"I don't want it to stop. I want to keep it going.\" \n \n- Enjoy the moment - \n \nBeing at the top for so long means Williams now carefully selects her tournaments, and she is set to take a break now until Indian Wells in early March. \n \nShe said she wanted to enjoy winning in Australia, and give it time to sink in. \n \n\"One thing I learned in the past is you have to enjoy it. That's the beauty of winning Australia, you have a few months to relax,\" she said. \n \n\"If you win the French, it's like back-to-back-to-back-to-back. Australia, you have time to enjoy the moment before the next Grand Slam.\" \n \nWilliams also has wedding plans to make after her recent engagement to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who was courtside for her historic victory. \n \nShe revealed that elder sister Venus would be a bridesmaid, but not when the marriage would take place nor where. \n \nBut she said it was special having Ohanian by her side in Melbourne. \n \n\"He's been so supportive in the stands. Although I never really heard him, even though I heard he was very boisterous,\" she said. \n \n\"I'm so focused, I don't hear a lot. I have really selective hearing. It's nice to have that support. It is a wonderful feeling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Fighting spirit propels Serena to tennis greatness","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Yahoo!

Technology industry executives expressed personal dismay and concern for their companies in reacting to President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration. In company emails, interviews and posts published online, leaders from companies including Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. framed the order as one at odds with a nation that welcomes foreigners and an industry that counts foreign-born executives in its upper ranks. In doing so, they broke with weeks of cautious engagement with the new administration. Here is a rundown of their statements. Apple CEO Tim Cook Team, In my conversations with officials here in Washington this week, I've made it clear that Apple believes deeply in the importance of immigration--both to our company and to our nation's future. Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do. I've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support. There are employees at Apple who are directly affected by yesterday's immigration order. Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them. We're providing resources on AppleWeb for anyone with questions or concerns about immigration policies. And we have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our co-workers and our company. As I've said many times, diversity makes our team stronger. And if there's one thing I know about the people at Apple, it's the depth of our empathy and support for one another. It's as important now as it's ever been, and it will not weaken one bit. I know I can count on all of you to make sure everyone at Apple feels welcome, respected and valued. Apple is open. Open to everyone, no matter where they come from, which language they speak, who they love or how they worship. Our employees represent the finest talent in the world, and our team hails from every corner of the globe. In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, \"We may have all come on different ships, but we are in the same boat now.\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella As an immigrant and as a CEO, I've both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world. We will continue to advocate on this important topic. Microsoft President Brad Smith As a company, Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system. We also believe in broader immigration opportunities, like the protections for talented and law-abiding young people under the Deferred Access for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program, often called \"Dreamers.\" We believe that immigration laws can and should protect the public without sacrificing people's freedom of expression or religion. And we believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings. (Full statement here.) Google CEO Sundar Pichai We're upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S....It's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues. Uber Technologies CEO Travis Kalanick Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi Ours is a nation of immigrants. These are our roots, this is our soul. All erased with the stroke of a pen. I was incredibly fortunate to arrive in the U.S. with my family after the Iranian revolution. I don't have an Iranian passport and have never been back but have no idea if I'm on a list someplace listed as an Iranian citizen. And I'm a lucky one. We should strive for safe borders. But we have a responsibility as the world's greatest nation. And we sure aren't acting our part. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg My great-grandparents came from Germany, Austria and Poland. Priscilla's parents were refugees from China and Vietnam. The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that. Like many of you, I'm concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump. We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don't pose a threat will live in fear of deportation. (Full statement here.) Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the U.S. They've done right, not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected....The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country's challenges Tweets: https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502618680045568 and https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502400454594561 Code.org CEO Hadi Partovi My family left Iran to escape a bloody war when I was 11, during the Reagan administration. America welcomed us as legal immigrants with visas. Code.org and the Hour of Code wouldn't exist otherwise. (Facebook post here.) Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky Open doors brings all of US together. Closing doors further divides US. Let's all find ways to connect people, not separate them. Tweet: https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/825407087085645824 Y Combinator President Sam Altman The tech community is powerful. Large tech companies in particular have enormous power and are held in high regard. We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally. Although there is some business risk in doing so, there is strength in numbers--if everyone does it early this coming week, we will all make each other stronger. (Full statement here.) Netflix CEO Reed Hastings Trump's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all. Worse, these actions will make America less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe. A very sad week, and more to come with the lives of over 600,000 Dreamers here in a America under imminent threat. It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity. (Facebook post here.) Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff When we close our hearts & stop loving other people as ourselves (Mk 12:31) we forget who we truly are--a light unto the nations. #noban Tweet: https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/825470203299377152 Uber Technologies CEO Travis Kalanick Our People Ops team has already reached out to the dozen or so employees who we know are affected: for example, those who live and work in the U.S., are legal residents but not naturalized citizens will not be able to get back into the country if they are traveling outside of the U.S. now or anytime in the next 90 days. Anyone who believes that this order could impact them should contact immigration@uber.com immediately. This order has far broader implications as it also affects thousands of drivers who use Uber and come from the listed countries, many of whom take long breaks to go back home to see their extended family. These drivers currently outside of the U.S. will not be able to get back into the country for 90 days. That means they will not be able to earn a living and support their families--and of course they will be separated from their loved ones during that time. We are working out a process to identify these drivers and compensate them pro bono during the next three months to help mitigate some of the financial stress and complications with supporting their families and putting food on the table. We will have more details on this in the coming days. (Full statement here.) Box CEO Aaron Levie On every level--moral, humanitarian, economic, logical, etc.--this ban is wrong and is completely antithetical to the principles of America. Tweet: https://twitter.com/levie/status/825424282679283712 Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey The Executive Order's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting. We benefit from what refugees and immigrants bring to the U.S. Tweets: https://twitter.com/jack/status/825476172658200577 Slack Technologies CEO Stewart Butterfield \"And he's just getting started.\" -- It's still so hard to believe that this is real life.

Injuries. Injuries. And, more injuries. \n \nDespite that, the Penguins women\u2019s basketball team came up just short against Milwaukee on Saturday, 78-74. \n \nYSU (7-14, 3-7 Horizon League) went on a 19-9 run capped by Melinda Trimmer\u2019s 3-pointer with eight seconds remaining to cut the Panthers lead to 76-74. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s sad that we step up when we need to when we\u2019re down,\u201d said Alison Smolinski, who had seven points in the run. \u201cWe need to start doing that throughout the whole game.\u201d \n \nSierra Ford-Washington, who had 18 points in the game, made two shots at the foul line with five seconds remaining to put the game away for Milwaukee (15-6, 7-3). \n  \nTribune Chronicle / John Vargo Youngstown State\u2019s Alison Smolinski, right, dribbles as Milwaukee\u2019s Bailey Farley tries to get around the pick of YSU\u2019s Natalie Myers Saturday in Youngstown. \n \nYSU coach John Barnes, who has seen his top three returning players \u2014 Nikki Arbanas, Kelsea Newman and Sarah Cash \u2014 go down with knee injuries, saw three more injured during this homestand. \n \nSix-foot-3 freshman Mary Dunn, YSU\u2019s leading scorer this season, sprained her ankle in the first half of Thursday\u2019s loss to Green Bay and is out indefinitely. Then, at halftime Saturday, senior Jenna Hirsch had her back bothering her again and couldn\u2019t play the final 20 minutes. \n \nIf Hirsch is out, YSU is down to eight scholarship players and two walk-ons. Freshman Jen Oduho (5-11) is also out for the season with a leg injury. That would leave Smolinski, India Benjamin, Mailee Jones, Trimmer, Izzy Meese, Natalie Myers, Morgan Olson, Morgan Brunner, Kelley Wright and Tamira Ford. Meese and Brunner are walk-ons. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we can practice now,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the kids for fighting as hard as they could. We gave ourselves a chance, despite everything that happened. I\u2019m proud of them for that.\u201d \n \nIn the first half, Milwaukee went on a 13-0 run, and held YSU scoreless for 6:12 in the second quarter to go up 33-21. Then, Hirsch had two free throws with 1:32 left before halftime and Smolinski added a 3-pointer as the Penguins trailed 33-26 at the break. \n \nMilwaukee\u2019s Steph Kostowicz, a 6-2 forward, had 13 points for the Panthers in the half, while Ford-Washington added 11. The two combined for 12 of the team\u2019s 21 rebounds at the break. \n \nKostowicz ended with a game-high 22 points, while Jenny Lindner had 20 and Bailey Farley added 12. \n \nOlson had a career-high 20 points for YSU, tied with game-high honors with Smolinski. Benjamin added 10. \n \n\u201cI was glad I could take advantage of the opportunity,\u201d Olson said. \u201cIt sucks that Mary hurt her ankle, but we\u2019re hoping she gets back in here and gets into it. I wanted to go out and do my best for the team.\u201d \n \nThe 6-foot Olson was more of a spark than she knew. Olson and Ford are two of teams remaining forwards, along with Myers. Ford added seven points. \n \nThe size disadvantage hurt YSU as Milwaukee held a 42-22 advantage in points in the paint. \n \n\u201cWithout her offensively, we would\u2019ve grinded to a halt for the most part,\u201d Barnes said of Olson. \u201cI thought she did a good job of posting up strong and getting the ball and making strong moves in there. Very proud of her in her first start.\u201d \n \nOlson hopes YSU doesn\u2019t have to play from behind going forward, like it did Saturday. \n \n\u201cA lot of these games we\u2019ve got into a hole. Then at the end we came back and fought,\u201d Olson said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really close. We need to make sure we put it all together and we\u2019re playing all the minutes just as hard as the last.\u201d \n \nThe Penguins begin a four-game road trip Thursday against Valparaiso, starting at 8 p.m.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"YSU women rally, but fall short again","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Trumbull","zipCode":"44483","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Warren","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tribune Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169710805","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"299"},"name":"Tribune Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tribune-chronicle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197538051","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Morse dribbled up the court and found Brett Frantz open beyond the arc. There, Frantz quickly canned a 3-pointer with 2:50 remaining \u2014 making up for an earlier turnover. \n \n\u201cIt started out that he got pressured and I came to relieve him,\u201d said Frantz, who had 17 points. \u201cI was going to hand it off to him and it got bobbled.

He ran, chased it down, blocked it, got it to us. I saw a little space, raised my hand to Cam. I shot it, knowing I missed a couple of 3s before that, just hoping it went in and it did.\u201d \n \nCleveland State coach Gary Waters said that play was a game-changer. \n \n\u201cI think that turned the entire game to that point,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had the momentum going into that play. We get the steal. It was a good block. No need to complain there. Our guy kind of gambled. They threw it over the top and hit a 3. \n \n\u201cI thought it was the biggest play of the game.\u201d \n \nYSU coach Jerry Slocum said he\u2019s never heard such a roar from the Beeghly Center crowd since the Penguins upset former Horizon League member and two-time national runner-up Butler in 2011. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve heard our crowd ever louder than when Frantz made that 3,\u201d said Slocum, whose team played in front of 4,821 fans. \u201cThat was a great environment tonight. Those two plays were defining moments of that game, that 3 and his block.\u201d \n \nThe Vikings (6-16, 2-8) were far from done. \n \nDeomonte Flannigan, who led the Vikings with 16 points, hit a hook shot inside the charity stripe with 1:16 left. \n \nBobby Word blocked Morse\u2019s 3-point attempt with 39 seconds left, forcing a shot-clock violation. Flannigan missed a jumper with 10.6 seconds left and Santiago came up with the rebound and was fouled. The YSU guard made 1-of-2 from the line to put YSU up three, giving the Vikings a last-ditch effort to force overtime. \n \n\u201cIt was there for us,\u201d Waters said of the Flannigan miss. \u201cWe just missed the opportunity.\u201d \n \nWord\u2019s 3-point attempt from 22 feet out was off the mark with four seconds remaining, following back-to-back Cleveland State timeouts, effectively ending the game. \n \nThe Penguins, who amassed a 15-point lead on a Matt Donlan 3-pointer with 12:31 remaining, saw poor free-throw shooting and eight second-half turnovers start to take its toll on a YSU team desperate for a victory after coming in losing three straight. \n \nAn equally hungry Cleveland State team started to chip away and cut the lead to one on Deomonte Flannigan\u2019s two free throws with 4:30 remaining. Morse, who had a game-high 23 points, countered with a quick lay-up as the two teams went into a timeout with the Penguins holding a three-point edge. \n \nWaters said his team made some adjustments to counter the Penguins\u2019 11-0 run to start the second half. \n \n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t do anything against the zone,\u201d Waters said. \u201cIn the first half, we had the lead. Then they went to the zone and went on a 13-0 run on us. We, for I\u2019m going to say five minutes, couldn\u2019t score a bucket. We still haven\u2019t solved it. We were getting some shots, but they weren\u2019t great shots. Then we finally got the understanding of how to get the shot and get it inside. I thought it let us back in the game.\u201d \n \nYSU is in the midst of a three-game homestand with Oakland coming Thursday and Detroit on Saturday. \n \nA SON\u2019S WISDOM: Slocum said his son, Aaron, had a simple observation following the game. \n \n\u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be that close, you know,\u201d Jerry said. \n \n\u201cWe had them in a good position. Give them credit. They fought hard. They did some good things defensively. We made some mistakes. Got sped up for a couple of turnovers.\u201d \n \nDEFENSIVE STAND: Youngstown State shot 50 percent for the game (26-of-52), but had arguably its best defensive game as well \u2014 holding Cleveland State to 25-of-64 (39.1 percent). \n \nThey held all-league player Rob Edwards to seven points. \n \n\u201cScores don\u2019t indicate it, but if you watch the Green Bay game, I thought one of our better defensive efforts of the year was against them,\u201d Slocum said. \u201cBut yes, this was a great effort tonight defensively.\u201d \n \nHORIZON LEAGUE STANDINGS: YSU is in eighth place, a half-game out of seventh, a game out of sixth and a game-and-a-half from three three-way tie for third. \n \nValparaiso leads (17-4, 7-1), while Green Bay is second (13-8, 7-2). Oakland (15-7, 5-4), Northern Kentucky (14-8, 5-4) and Wright State (14-8, 5-4) are tied for third. UIC (11-10, 4-4) is sixth, while Milwaukee (8-14, 4-5) is seventh. Detroit Mercy (4-17, 2-7) and Cleveland State are the final two teams in the standings. \n \nNEW UNIFORMS?: Youngstown State wore its white uniforms with pink outlining for the second time this season. The first time the Penguins wore them was for the Northeast Ohio Coaches vs. Cancer doubleheader where YSU upset Mid-American Conference leader Akron to begin the season. \n \nSaturday was a Coaches vs. Cancer Suits and Sneakers event where coaches wore sneakers to promote cancer awareness as part of an initiative with the National Basketball Coaches Association and the American Cancer Society. \n \nShould YSU bring the uniforms out again since it is 2-0? \n \n\u201cYou might see them next week,\u201d Slocum said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Hungry for a victory","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Trumbull","zipCode":"44483","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Warren","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tribune Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169710805","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"299"},"name":"Tribune Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tribune-chronicle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197539939","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

According to the Central Electricity Authority monthly report, total power generation in the country was 95.123 billion units (BUs) in December 2016, which was 6.13 per cent higher than 89.625 BUs electricity generation in the corresponding month previous year. \n\nHowever, as per the report, the electricity generation target of 96.999 BUs could not be achieved in December. \n\nSimilarly, the CEA report said power generation grew 8.53 per cent in November, 2016 to 93.235 BUs compared to 85.904 BUs in same month year ago. However, the target of 93.236 could not be achieved. \n\n\"The generation in the month of November was almost on track as there is not much difference in the actual output and target. But power generation is 1.8 BUs short of the targetted output in December,\" said an expert. \n\nAccording to the CEA data, the per capita consumption of electricity was 1,075 units in 2015-16 as per provisional estimates. Therefore, output of 1.8 billion units could have lit thousands of houses in the country where a large number of people either live without electricity or face outages due to shortages in supply. \n\nHowever, Power Ministry data indicates that distribution companies collections increased by more than Rs 3,000 crore from November 10 to December 15, 2016 compared to last year i.E. After the demonetisation move. \n\nAccording to the Power Ministry, this will help achieve affordable tariffs. \n\nNorth Bihar Power Distribution Company saw a 204 per cent increase, NESCO in Odisha 251 per cent, APDCL in Assam 97 per cent and TANGEDCO in Tamil Nadu witnessed 97 per cent rise in collections. \n\nHowever, the experts think that this has happened because people have parked their black money with discoms to pay their electricity due in advance for many months. \n\nThey think that such practice will not continue as utilities have already stopped honouring junked high value currency notes of Rs 1,000/500.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Power Min misses target despite rise in output for Nov-Dec","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNOu"],"sequenceId":"695197542376","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Bembem, who made her international debut in 1995 as a 15-year-old and retired in February last year after guiding India to a gold medal in the South Asian Games in Shillong, lamented that women footballers are not considered at par with their male counterparts when it comes to recognition from the government. \n\n\"I applied for Arjuna Award for three years since 2014 and I was snubbed each time. Only men footballers have got Arjuna Award for so long, women footballers are not considered worthy of the Arjuna Award. I don't know why.

Among them are stalwarts like I M Vijayan, Bhaichung Bhutia and Sunil Chhetri. \n\nBembem has won two SAFF Championships, two South Asian Games and has been an integral part of the Indian team in various international events like Asian Games, Olympics and and the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers. She has worn the captain's armband in six international tournaments starting from 2003. \n\nBesides inspiring a generation of Indian women to take up football, especially in powerhouse Manipur and other states of Northeast India, Bembem is also a pioneer as she is the first to feature in a top-flight foreign league by playing for New Radiant Sports Club of Maldives in 2014. \n\nHer club won the Maldives women's league and became the highest goal-scorer. \n\n\"We (women footballers) also win SAFF Championships, South Asian Games. We played in the Asian Games, qualifying tournaments of the World Cup, Olympics and AFC Asian Cup and we are even higher than men's team in FIFA rankings but why do only men get Arjuna Award and not women footballers?\" she rued. \n\nWhile the Indian men's team is ranked 129th, the women are placed 54th in the current FIFA rankings.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Why are mostly men footballers getting Arjuna? asks Bembem","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNP1"],"sequenceId":"695197542536","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:28Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Our idea is to increase the share of MSME and affordable housing in the next 12-15 months time. \n\n\"Also, our ticket size in MSME and housing is on the lower side. We want to increase the ticket size,\" Govind Singh, MD and CEO, Utkarsh Small Finance Bank told PTI. \n\nSingh said micro financing still remains one of the key components in the company's balance sheet and asset size growth will come from MSME and affordable housing sectors. \n\nCurrently, the average ticket size of MSME loan is around Rs 90,000, which the company would raise up to Rs 7-8 lakh going forward. \n\nFor affordable housing segment, the average ticket size of the loan will increase to Rs 25 lakh from current Rs 5-6 lakh, Singh said. \n\nHaving evolved from a non-banking finance company (NBFC) to an SFB now, Singh said the focus will be to create assets through deposit growth and gain more retail customers. \n\n\"For a bank, it is more important to create assets. As an NBFC, we were getting money from various sources, banks and FIIs. Now going forward, our focus will be to increase our retail liabilities portfolio, create deposits. So our core focus is going to be on that retail liabilities to increase our base as a bank,\" Singh said. \n\nThe bank's big focus is on retail liabilities and all the branches are geared up for that from day one, he said, adding it will target the interior areas of the country. \n\nTo attract customers, the bank will offer deposit rates that are 1-1.25 percentage points higher than other banks. \n\n\"In terms of balance sheet, I think by March 2018 we are looking around Rs 2,000 crore of overall deposits from public. and our asset size will be Rs 3,000-4,000 crore plus by that time and the rest (the difference) will come from borrowings,\" he said. \n\nSingh said Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, which cover almost one-third of the country's population, would drive business growth as it would target customers in these states. \n\nIn the last one year, Utkarsh has hired over 1,000 people and plans to recruit another 1,000 in the next 12 months as it opens more branches.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Utkarsh Micro to focus on affordable housing, MSMEs: CEO","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNP0"],"sequenceId":"695197542700","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He also assured the American President that Islamabad would not build a nuclear bomb, asserting its atomic programme was for peaceful purpose. \n\nIn the confidential letter dated July 5, 1982, recently declassified by the CIA, Zia had made a veiled reference to India and said there were \"open and insidious\" attempts to weaken Pakistan's ties with the US and that the peaceful nuclear programme has been misrepresented to divert attention from critical developments in the region. \n\nZia also took strong objection to assertion by the then US Envoy Vernon Walters that there were \"incontrovertible\" information that Pakistan was planning to acquire nuclear weapons. \n\n\"It caused me deep anguish to have Ambassador Waters speak of incontrovertible information that Pakistan had taken steps to acquire nuclear weapons which threatened seriously to damage relations between the US and Pakistan,\" Zia said in the letter. \n\nIn 2015, former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani had revealed that Pakistan played a key role in the development of Iran's nuclear programme during the 1980s. \n\nIn clear reference to India, Zia said Pakistan's nuclear programme had been \"misrepresented\" to such an extent to divert attention from the \"critical developments\" in the region. \n\n\"We attach equal importance to our new relationship with your great country, and feel confident that it will prove to be enduring. It will be so, if we are conscious of the assaults on this relationship, both open and insidious, by those whose interests are not served by it and if we are determined to defeat them,\" he said in the letter. \n\nZia said matters of common concerns including \"susceptibilities of our Indian neighbour\" were addressed.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"Pakistan news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Zia-ul-Haq assured Reagan Pak wouldn't leak nuke-tech: CIA","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNP2"],"sequenceId":"695197543193","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:32Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

However, many respondents expect credit demand to improve after 3-6 months as economic activities are expected to pick up by that time. \n\nOn the other hand, flush with liquidity, a majority of banks (82 per cent of those polled) reported a rise in their low cost CASA deposits during the period July-December 2016. \n\nIn fact, 53 per cent of the respondent banks reported a substantial increase in CASA deposits and attributed the same to demonetisation, besides their own efforts to mobilise opening of savings account. \n\nNotably, in the previous survey round, only 25 per cent of respondents had reported a substantial increase, while 50 per cent had reported a moderate increase in such deposits. \n\nLenders believe a hike in foreign direct investment (FDI) limit for state-owned banks (from 20 per cent to 49 per cent) will help in raising further capital and thereby meeting capital requirements under Basel-III norms. \n\nIn the Budget, banks also expect the government to boost consumption demand and investment through reduction in corporate as well as personal income tax, and by providing additional deductions under section 80C and interest on home loans. \n\nWith a thrust on less-cash economy, banks are also eyeing additional incentives for digital transactions, including tax benefits for customers as well as merchants. \n\nThey have also urged for enhancing capital expenditure, especially for infrastructure. Other key suggestions include measures to fast track NPA resolution, creation of a Central Corporate Repository and interest payment on CRR balance. \n\nBanks also felt interest subvention for farm loans should be parked with them in advance, as it takes 7-8 months for settlement of claims, leading to interest loss. \n\nThey also want the government to announce additional tax incentives for customers on term deposits, such as reduction in lock-in period for tax saver fixed deposits, and increase in tax exemption limit for interest income from term deposits. \n\nThe survey revealed that iron and steel, infrastructure and textiles continue to account for a large concentration of non-performing assets (NPAs). \n\nOverall, the number of banks reporting a rise in the level of NPAs is lower in the current round of the survey as against the preceding round. While 76 per cent of the participating banks reported a rise in the level of NPAs during July-December, 85 per cent had reported so for the preceding six month period. \n\nGoing forward, the key sectors identified by banks which could see a greater demand for long term credit include infrastructure, automobiles and food processing.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"Banking news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Banks eyeing big-ticket reforms in Budget: Survey","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNOx"],"sequenceId":"695197544925","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:18Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2594","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Young","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Young Witness","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"351643453","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Young Witness","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.youngwitness.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197554155","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \n Lawsuit is first challenge to executive order  \n The class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order , which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants.  \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \n Released under special circumstances  \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n 'The executive order is unlawful'  \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n    \n\n   \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n The lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times.  \n Legality questioned  \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n    \n\n   \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CNN.com - RSS Channel - Mobile App Manual"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Mercer","zipCode":"61231","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Aledo","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WRMJ - 102.3 FM","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"556516848","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"WRMJ - 102.3 FM","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://wrmj.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/27/politics/trump-plans-to-sign-executive-action-on-refugees-extreme-vetting/index.html","http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/middleeast/iran-will-ban-us-citizens/index.html","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=a-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news","http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/trump-visa-ban-families-refugees-stories/index.html","http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=c1JTpJbqr0E:XoJtd5CyMVA:yIl2AUoC8zA","http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=c1JTpJbqr0E:XoJtd5CyMVA:7Q72WNTAKBA","http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=c1JTpJbqr0E:XoJtd5CyMVA:V_sGLiPBpWU","http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=c1JTpJbqr0E:XoJtd5CyMVA:qj6IDK7rITs","http://rss.cnn.com/~ff/rss/cnn_topstories?a=c1JTpJbqr0E:XoJtd5CyMVA:gIN9vFwOqvQ"],"sequenceId":"695197559466","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Management passed to DOC in 1990, when the board was abolished. \n \nDOC Auckland Operations Director Andrew Baucke advised \u201cMotukorea Browns Island holds a special place in the hearts of Aucklanders. It\u2019s close to the central city and is easily accessible by boat and kayak. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s been a privilege and pleasure for DOC to manage the island in partnership with Auckland City and Auckland Council. But it makes sense for Auckland Council to manage an island it owns.\u201d \n \nIt is intended that the island remain in the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park and that there will be integrated management with other reserves and islands within the inner Hauraki Gulf to protect and enhance the values associated with the island. \n \nThe island made headlines in November 2016 when a person stranded there set an apparent signal fire that burned out of control and went on to engulf 13 hectares - roughly a quarter of the island. \n \nWaitematā and Gulf Ward Councillor Mike Lee believes the island is best run by the Council, but suggests one step further is taken, stating \u201cMotukorea Browns Island should be our next regional park.\u201d \n \nCouncillor Chris Fletcher, a long-time advocate for the Hauraki Gulf, added \u201cMotukorea is important to New Zealand\u2019s history and environment.

The report, whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986. \n\nThe very first sentence of the report's available (undeleted) page reads: \"Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\" It, however, later clearly said that \"assassination is the major near-term threat\" to him. \n\nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991. \n\nThe first section titled \"Key Judgments\" analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India's relations with the US, the then USSR and the region. \n\nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi's life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder. \n\n\"If Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures - including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India - were taken by the Indian President ......(deleted),\" it said. \n\nInterestingly, it also names P V Narasimha Rao and V P Singh, who could be the \"interim successor\" and \"likely candidates\" in case of sudden exit by Rajiv. Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991. \n\nIn a section, titled 'The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy', the report says \"In our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\" besides \"a fanatical Hindu\". \n\nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis. However, another section deals in- depth with Rajiv's mediation efforts to resolve \"the conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo...\n\nBesides Gandhi's possible assassination, the report also \n\nanalysed various scenarios of his \"abrupt departure\" from the political scene before 1989. \n\n\"Although we believe assassination is the major near-term threat to Rajiv's tenure, any of several other events could cause his abrupt departure from the political scene before 1989,\" it said while listing out several other possibilities including \"his death from natural causes or by accident\". \n\nIt ruled out the possibility of a decision by him \"to resign out of frustration\", saying \"we see no signs of this and believe it would be out of character\". \n\nThe CIA report also noted: \"We suspect, however, that Rajiv would calculate -- as we do -- that he and his kin would be targets for extremist violence even if he left public office.\" \n\nIn a section called \"Implications for the United States\", the report says \"We believe (Rajiv) Gandhi's death would represent a significant blow to US interests, regardless of the circumstances of the succession.\" \n\n\"...We believe Indo-US relations could also suffer as a result of domestic political changes following Rajiv's assassination.\" \n\nThe report assessed Rajiv's policies ranging from dealing with extremists, foreign relations (including Sri Lankan Tamil issue) to promoting acquisition of selected foreign technology\" among others, and their outcome. \n\n\"Although some of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's policies will continue to encounter serious resistance over the next several years, we believe his dominance of the Indian political scene is secure until at least the end of his present term of office in December 1989, barring his incapacitation or death,\" it said. \n\nThe report also dealt with the possibility of a \"national government\" taking over in case of a sudden exit by Rajiv, while discounting the possibility of a military coup in such a scenario. \n\nSeveral portions of the 23-page report were deleted before the CIA decided to release it under the Freedom of Information Act.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sri Lanka news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"'CIA assessed Rajiv assassination 5 yrs before he was killed'","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNOm"],"sequenceId":"695197562928","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:14Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2594","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Young","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Young Witness","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"351643453","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Young Witness","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.youngwitness.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197564027","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Since then she has refined what many people describe as her \u201cgift,\u201d and since 2001 Mitleid has been working full-time as an intuitive counselor, professional tarot reader, psychic, trained medium and motivational speaker. She\u2019s comfortable with any or all of those job descriptions. \n \nA Cherry Hill, New Jersey native who lives in Cobleskill with her husband Carle Kopecky, Mitleid works six days a week and is on the road 40 weekends a year visiting clients and appearing at psychic fairs. \n \nThis month she\u2019s been anxiously awaiting the release of her new book, \u201cClean Out Your Lifecloset,\u201d available Tuesday for purchase in paperback and digital formats on Amazon and iTunes. \n \n\u201cLast year I started doing blogs on Facebook and each month had a different theme,\u201d said Mitleid, who majored in theater at Brown University. \u201cPeople always asked me, \u2018why don\u2019t you write a book,\u2019 and halfway through the year of writing blogs I realized I had a book right there. It\u2019s based on four things we wrestle with so much: clarity, simplicity, adaptability and stress. It\u2019s the 21st Century. We all have stress.\u201d \n \nBefore focusing on spiritualism, Mitleid worked as an actor in New York City, a television producer and an executive recruiter. In 1994, she says she \u201chung out her shingle part-time.\u201d \n \n\u201cI had always had trouble finding a place for my passion,\u201d she said. \u201cBut all of a sudden in 1994 I found I could do hands-on healing and talk to dead people with no training. Then I was watching the Twin Towers burn on 9/11 and I said to my husband, \u2018I\u2019m going to need to do this full-time. People need to know there\u2019s something besides fear in the world.\u2019 \u201d \n \nMitleid says she isn\u2019t in the business to tell us who\u2019s going to finish first in the Kentucky Derby, how to win the Lottery, or predict tomorrow\u2019s weather. She\u2019s here to help people make it through their trials and tribulations. \n\u201cI\u2019m not a fortune teller and I don\u2019t want to take over your life,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me if you\u2019re going to be a success. That\u2019s the wrong question.

A9], Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s budget reflects a \u201crosy picture\u201d of middle class tax cuts, ride-sharing services and infrastructure spending. \n \nAs the article states, however, there are apparent deficiencies. \n \nOne in particular is that the budget clearly fails to address the low wages of direct care workers \u2014 as noted by state Sen. George Amedore and Assemblyman Angelo Santabarbara \u2014 a position also supported by other legislators from both sides of the aisle. \n \nThese highly dedicated critical care workers have enormous responsibility in caring for New York state\u2019s physically and mentally disabled citizens, including our children. \n \nAn increase of $90 million would provide important progress and would only be a tiny fraction of this over $150 billion budget \u2014 a small investment towards adequately compensating these grossly underpaid workers. \nYet there is an absence of any appreciation or recognition of the most difficult and awesome responsibilities of these workers. \n \nThey are responsible, and culpable for, dispensing life-sustaining medications multiple times throughout the day, as well as supporting our children in meeting their essential daily needs. These needs include bathing, toileting, assistance with dressing, cooking, feeding and transporting our family members either to their jobs or day programs, where they receive speech and physical therapies. \n \nWhy are these workers forgotten once again? \n \nThe article states already a vacancy rate of 10 percent and a turnover rate of over 20 percent. \n \nWith all the attention and provision for increases for minimum wage and fast-food workers, the critical care worker is the forgotten step-child once again. \n \nIt is completely predictable that those other wage increases will increase vacancies and turnover further and jeopardize the care of our family members\u2014the most vulnerable in society. \n \nClearly, significant budget provision is essential for these critical care workers who are grossly underpaid for the incredible responsibilities they have. \n \nWe urge the governor and the legislators to fulfill their most fundamental responsibilities to those who are unable to care for themselves and plug this most serious hole in New York state\u2019s budget. \n \nNew York\u2019s direct care worker wages must be substantially increased so that the profession can attract and retain qualified employees to preserve the public welfare. \n \nSurely there are many places to find this funding given this highest purpose of preserving the public welfare \u2014 the most fundamental and greatest obligation of our elected leaders. \n \nENYDDA is an independent, all-volunteer organization founded in 2015 to advocate for disabled family members and educate policymakers and the public on matters impacting the developmentally disabled.

She dropped off 158 blankets to the Northeast Parent & Child Society\u2019s thrift store at the State Street Presbyterian Church. \n \nNortheast clients who need help battling chills of the season can pick up a couple blankets for free. \n\u201cThere are lots that are brand new, others that are used but in excellent condition,\u201d said Lewis, 60, who drove a loaded silver van into the church parking lot during the early afternoon. It only took a few minutes for volunteers to carry about 30 bags full of blankets into the \u201cShop on Park\u201d store. \n \nLewis has organized a blanket drive every year since 2010. As a part-time cashier supervisor at the Niskayuna Co-Op food market on Nott Street in Niskayuna, she begins the campaign every October and gets plenty of support from Co-Op shoppers. The drive ends each year on Dec. 31. \n \nLewis always picks a charity for the blanket bonanza. \u201cI\u2019ve given them to Safe House on Albany Street, for homeless teenagers, to Bethesda House on State Street, the City Mission, the Women\u2019s Family Life Center, part of the City Mission, and Sojourn House,\u201d she said. \n \nShe appreciates the assorted food drives and coat drives, but thought a blanket drive would be a different way to help out the community \u2014 especially when many families with financial trouble cut costs by cutting down the heat in their homes. \n \n\u201cI always thought that blankets are something you don\u2019t have enough of,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving an extra blanket here and there is helpful.\u201d \n \nLewis also liked the chance to help out Northeast, where she\u2019s worked as a residential counselor in the group housing program for the past 15 years. \n \nThe three-room \u201cShop on Park\u201d store includes skirts, shirts, children\u2019s boots, adult shoes, kitchen items, children\u2019s clothing, board games and stuffed animals. It is open, at the church located at State and Catherine Street, every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 9 a.m. until noon. Only clients from Northeast Parent and the Parsons Child and Family Center in Albany may shop \u2014 everything is free \u2014 in the store. \n \n\u201cThe need is constant,\u201d said Eugene White, a spokesman for Northern Rivers, the parent organization for both Northeast and Parsons. \u201cOur families, many of them, face poverty and struggle to meet basic needs.\u201d \n \nWhite added that the store helps out about 300 families each year. Right now, store clerks are glad to have the Lewis blanket collection in stock. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have very many at all right now,\u201d said store clerk Robin Herrmann. \n \nSome of the new arrivals are decorated with flowers. There are models with stripes and solid colors. All are guaranteed to warm up people reading books or watching TV in the February and March cold, and Lewis said she\u2019ll begin her next drive during early autumn. \n \n\u201cI have to keep it going,\u201d she said. \n \nReach Gazette reporter Jeff Wilkin at 395-3124 or at wilkin@dailygazette.com or @jeffwilkin1 on Twitter.

Work is expected to cost around $5.5 million and will be a complete restoration of the building, with the aim of making the venue a year-round facility. \n \nSo instead of one large show, the ECC is working to produce four smaller shows throughout the year. \nWhen ECC producer Corey Aldrich first found out about the construction, he attempted to find another venue and stick to the tradition of having one spring show. \n \n\u201cBut to match the magnitude that we had last year, we couldn\u2019t relocate,\u201d Aldrich said. \n \nAs a result, he and the ECC team are reinventing their schedule. \n \nNothing is set in stone yet, but Aldrich is contemplating holding one show per season in various locations across the Capital Region, the Berkshires and even New York City. \n \nFormed in 2010 \nECC, which was formed in 2010, works to create a sustainable fashion industry/market in the upstate area and to bring attention to local talent. \n \nLast year, the show took in $17,000 for the designers, $30,000 for charity, $10,000 for the creative employees of ECC and $10,000 for food and beverage vendors. \n \nCombined, the show brought in between $80,000-$90,000 in 2016. \n \n\u201cEveryone should benefit from it; we want to support our local artists and designers,\u201d Aldrich said. \n \nOne of the 10 designers who sent looks down the ECC runway had their entire collection purchased by a local boutique. \n \nFor other designers, a handful of their pieces were purchased by local stores and it helped them to gain some name recognition. \n \nGiving the local fashion scene a bit more credibility is another goal of the ECC. \n \nLately, they\u2019ve not only gained credibility on a local level, but on more populated stomping grounds with an exhibit in New York City. \n \nArtist and designer Vilma Mare, who has worked with ECC in years past, is showing her collection called \u201cCreating Beauty that Protects.\u201d It\u2019s a reflection of the personal aspects of politics and Lithuanian heritage. \n \nThe pieces are exhibited at the Consulate General of Lithuania (420 5th Ave No. 304 | New York, NY 10018) until Feb. 14. \n \n\u201cThe last day of the exhibit is actually during New York\u2019s Fashion Week, so we\u2019re going to try to get people to go to it from Fashion Week as well,\u201d Aldrich said. \n \nAmidst finding other venues for their other shows, the ECC will have plenty of other things to keep it busy. \nAldrich said that the ECC will most likely also take part in Troy\u2019s Steampunk Festival this summer with a fashion show.

If history has taught us anything, it\u2019s to not take anything for granted. \n \nIf President Trump says he plans to deport millions, punish women who\u2019ve had abortions and build a wall, why give him the benefit of the doubt and write it off as garish campaign rhetoric? \n \nThe campaign is over. It\u2019s been just over a week and he\u2019s already made moves to defund reproductive health programs around the globe, create discriminatory immigration laws, strain relations with our neighbors and delegitimize the press with the rise of \u201calternative facts.\u201d \n \nFor some, what is personal and what is political remain in two separate spheres. For others, it\u2019s painfully clear how politics impact their lives and those they love. \n \nAs a member of the press, as the sister of veterans, as someone who identifies as bisexual, as someone who benefits from the Affordable Care Act, as a woman who has relied on birth control to regulate my period since high school, as someone who has been sexually assaulted, Trump\u2019s words are not abstract. His policies will impact my life directly. \n \nIf you\u2019re not concerned after the first week of this new administration, my only guess is that you\u2019re not reading the news, you\u2019re overestimating our system of checks and balances, or you support his attacks on women\u2019s health, his discriminatory policies towards immigrants and refugees, and his total disregard for the environment and the freedom of the press. \n \nSix journalists were slapped with felonies while covering protests in Washington, D.C., on inauguration day. Just days later, Trump adviser Stephen Bannon referred to the press as the opposition and suggested they \u201ckeep their mouths shut.\u201d \n \nIf you think we\u2019re living in a post-feminist world, as President Trump\u2019s right-hand woman Kellyanne Conway suggests, I beg you to look more closely. \n \nLook closely at the woman\u2019s white-knuckled fist as she strategically holds her car keys between her fingers on the walk from the grocery store to her car at night. \n \nKeep in mind that women are still fighting tooth and nail for their right to have control over their own bodies. Question why your male coworkers feel they are entitled to tell their female peers to \u201close the resting bitch face\u201d while they\u2019re simply focusing on doing their job. \n \nI am saddened and disheartened that my 4-year-old niece will grow up in a world where the leader of her nation has bragged about sexually assaulting women. \n \nI am saddened that the idea of a feminist has been distorted into an angry, misandric caricature when feminism is simply a call for equality and respect. \n \nThis is why we march. \n \nThis is why we sing and dance and holler in defiance of an administration that is eager to roll back the progress we have made in the last 50 years. \n \nFor those of you who don\u2019t think your rights will be impacted by this administration, all I ask is that you take the time to hear out those of us who are convinced otherwise.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Cady Kuzmich/Gazette reporter"},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Women need to keep up the fight","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Schenectady","zipCode":"12308","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Schenectady","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Schenectady Daily Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675772","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"17"},"name":"Schenectady Daily Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailygazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197581325","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

You design it yourself by filling out a check-off form.\u201d \n \nI\u2019m not a huge burger fan but I trusted Lois\u2019s judgment and the process intrigued me, so the day after New Year\u2019s John and I headed to Central Avenue. \n \nEveryday\u2019s Build A Burger Pub looks like a bar because, well, it is a bar. The building sports three doors: one on the left for the dining area consisting of nine tables and two peninsulas off the bar. A door on the right leads to the U-shaped bar, pool table and dart board, while a third door in the rear leads to a large deck with summer patio seating. \n \nNo two tables are alike: high-topped, low, peninsular, booth.

Bartender Matt had stepped out from behind his usual position as barkeep to deliver menus and a thick stack of paper napkins, to take our orders and to serve us. I was impressed by his versatility. \n \nA half sheet of pale yellow paper was devoted entirely to describing and ordering the Ground Steak Burger ($10). Or similar Charbroiled, Breaded or Sloppy Chicken, or Pulled Pork ($11). Or Carne Asada Beef (marinated and sliced, $12). We opted for the Everyday\u2019s regular burger\u2014a wise choice as it turned out. \n \nWhile Willie Nelson and John Denver serenaded us softly from one of the dozen televisions and four patrons sipped their beverages at the bar, we studied the variations. \n \nHow did we want the burger prepared? Rare? Medium rare? Medium? Medium well? Well? \n \nShould we choose chips, fries, cottage cheese or seasonal salad (macaroni the night we visited)? \n \nHot additions? Cherry peppers, fried mushrooms, fried bell peppers, fried onions? \n \nComplimentary mozzarella, cheddar or American (for one, $2 for each additional cheese)? \n \nCold additions on the side? (5 complimentary\u2014additional items were $1 each: from the usual lettuce, tomato and raw onions, to assorted peppers and sauces like pico de gallo and cranberry mayo). \n \nBlackening spice and marinara were $2 extra, while bacon was an additional $3. \n \nOur personalized burgers arrived quickly, and it was then we learned Matt was tonight\u2019s cook as well as making up the complete staff. Even tired from a long New Year\u2019s Eve and Day duty, Matt retained his speed and sense of humor. \n \nThe food was excellent. Our burger buns were branded with a Build a Burger insignia. My tomatoes, while of the paler winter variety, were large and sliced perfectly thin. The cherry peppers were vinegary with ample heat, though the excellent macaroni salad was on the verge of being too salty. John declared his \u201cFrench fried potatoes were sliced here.\u201d We later noted that the menu confirmed \u201cfresh cut fries.\u201d \n \nMinor matter \nThe only miscalculation: both burgers were cooked a notch above medium rare. My usual fussy self would have sent the burger back to the kitchen (an open small rear corner of the square building). But since neither flavor, juiciness nor tenderness were marred by the slight over grilling, I did not mention the minor problem to Matt until the end of the meal. Although he was genuinely apologetic, both John and I agreed the lack of pink had not interfered with our meal. \n \nMatt graciously showed us the kitchen. When he mentioned \u201cwings,\u201d John and I looked at each other in surprise. \u201cWings?!\u201d \n \nMatt explained that since we walked in talking about Everyday\u2019s Black Angus burgers, he assumed that was what we wanted. The more complete main menu boasted three categories of food: Chicken Central ($10) which included wings of many varieties from barbecue to Cajun to honey and beyond, Cheddar Cheese Quesadillas ($6) using many of the already mentioned burger toppings, and Starters (from salads at $4, to fries at $3, to mozzarella stix at $9, mini chimichangas for $9, mini pollo funditos for $10, and a platter for $12). \n \nHe apologized that the coffee machine was hung over from New Year\u2019s and coffee was not available. And customers had recently lost interest in dessert. John admitted he did not feel underfed, but we\u2019d surely return to Everyday\u2019s Build A Burger Pub to construct another masterpiece. \n \nEveryday\u2019s Build A Burger Pub \nWHERE: 2012 Central Avenue, Albany, 869-0494 BuildaBurgerPub.com \nWHEN: Mon.-Sun. 11 a.m.-2 a.m. \nHOW MUCH: $22.50 for two Black Angus burgers and a soda without tax and tip \nMORE INFO: accessible, parking lot, all major credit cards accepted, background music permits conversation, outside patio available in warm weather","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Beverly M.

Newburgh and Long Island. \n \nJust four areas of the state that have recently faced health threats from contaminated water supplies. They are far from the only ones. \n \nThere comes a time when you can no longer turn your back on a problem. \n \nAnd when it comes to the crisis of contaminated drinking water in New York state, the time for greater action has arrived. \n \nTo protect the long-term health of its residents, the state can\u2019t go half-hearted. It can\u2019t go on the cheap. Taxpayers must be willing to pay for improvements, not only for themselves but for the health of future generations. \n \nA report issued by the state Senate earlier this month included several recommendations for making New York\u2019s water safer to drink. \n \nThe recommendations include more reporting and public notification of contamination (possibly setting up a reverse 911 system for sharing information about spills and other contamination), more government testing, stricter standards on contaminants, greater connectivity between water sources and the state\u2019s cancer mapping system, more public education, creation of an independent entity that would include experts, scientists and water providers, and greater cooperation between state and federal agencies and other states. \nAll that is necessary. But fixing the problem ultimately comes down to fixing the infrastructure that carries and cleans our water supply. \n \nThe report recommended that in addition to ensuring that the Superfund Program and infrastructure water improvement grants are funded in the state budget, New York should establish a new clean water bond act to help smaller and more rural communities pay to fix their aging water and sewer systems. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s proposed budget includes a $2 billion clean water infrastructure fund. And last week, two state senators \u2014 one representing Long Island and the other central New York \u2014 introduced legislation to create a $5 billion Clean Water Bond Act. Voters would be asked to support the borrowing during a referendum in November. \n \nIt might be difficult for state residents, already highly taxed, to authorize borrowing that kind of money. But given the extent of the problem, they might have to bite the bullet. \n \nA report card issued last year by the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated the cost of repairing, replacing and updating the state\u2019s drinking water infrastructure would be $38.7 billion over 20 years. To repair, replace and update New York\u2019s wastewater infrastructure, the report concluded, would cost $36.2 billion over 20 years. \n \nWhile the state can\u2019t afford to spend $75 billion for a full-scale replacement of its entire water and wastewater infrastructure, the numbers do provide an idea of how extensive (and expensive) the problem is. \n \nThe $5 billion contained in the bond act wouldn\u2019t fully fund the solutions, but combined with other state and federal initiatives, it could go a long way toward helping municipalities make and afford improvements. \n \nNew York hasn\u2019t been totally ignoring its water problem, but it hasn\u2019t put on a full-court press to solve it either. The time for that kind of commitment has arrived. \n \nFailing to take significant action now will only put the health of New Yorkers in further danger.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"The time has come to fix our water problems","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Schenectady","zipCode":"12308","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Schenectady","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Schenectady Daily Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675772","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"17"},"name":"Schenectady Daily Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailygazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197582350","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Is there life after death? \n \nSpiritualism, the belief that the dead survive as spirits that can communicate with the living, has been debated throughout history, and in 2017 the discussion continues unabated. Believers will tell you that the number of like-minded people is growing, and while some in the other camp may dispute that, it\u2019s undeniable that a portion of the scientific community is conceding that the practice does have value. Dr. Robert L. Miller, a professor in the Social Welfare School at the University at Albany, says it\u2019s a subject he addresses in his class, Social Welfare and Spiritualism. \n \n\u201cThroughout history one of the challenges of social work was that it had a religious connotation,\u201d said Miller, who was recognized by the America East Conference of schools for his research on the \u201cintersection of spirituality, social welfare and public health.\u201d \u201cWe got in trouble because that turned into moralizing, so people stepped away from it. But I feel the best part of religion and spirituality is essential to good social work. People can use different terms, and in my class we talk about it rhetorically, but when we assess our clients, we have to let them talk about the various strengths they need to help them, and spirituality may indeed be included in that group.\u201d \n \nIn Monica McGoldrick\u2019s book, \u201cThe Expanded Family Life Cycle,\u201d read by students in the Social Welfare program at UAlbany, the author conceded that \u201calthough spirituality can be a resource in many circumstances, it is particularly appropriate for bereavement issues because all religions have rituals or beliefs for dealing with death, and this comforts many people.\u201d \n \nFinding comfort \nAnd comforting people, for many psychics, is what it\u2019s all about. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s about relief and release, and if I felt my work didn\u2019t have any value, I wouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d said D. Anne Austin, a native of Scotland, a Cypress resident and world-renown psychic who was offering readings at the Crossroads Gifts and Wellness on Jay Street in Schenectady last week. \u201cI work in light, love and truth, and it\u2019s very rewarding work. When you see someone who is downhearted and doesn\u2019t know where to go, I help them play to their strengths and use the power that they have. I\u2019ve had people come to me after 10 years and they\u2019ll say how our reading was the turning point in their life. That is a fabulous thing to hear.\u201d \n \nDr. J.B. Goss, a Sharon Springs resident, has worked in the pharmaceutical and health care field for more than three decades, and was Senior Vice-President of Comprehensive Neuroscience as well as director of Public Health for Johnson & Johnson. \n \n\u201cWhen I teach students I tell them the first thing you have to have is a healthy respect for what you don\u2019t know,\u201d said Goss, a graduate of St. John\u2019s University. \u201cThere\u2019s no scientific evidence to support psychics, but there\u2019s none out there to debunk them. There are charlatans and fakes out there, but there are also things we can\u2019t explain.\u201d \n \nAn example, according to Goss, is what seems to be the telepathic ability of twins. \n \n\u201cThere are a couple of good studies out there that show when you separate twins and show one an image, the brain changes, and the twin who was not in the room has the same brain change,\u201d said Goss. \u201cEven Einstein said that intelligence was important, but imagination is also very important. We\u2019re always improving testing. We\u2019re continuing to validate. But we have to respect what we don\u2019t know and go into it with a sense of wonder.\u201d \n \nAccording to Austin, that\u2019s exactly what great scientists do. \n \n\u201cThere are absolute truths, and sometimes science is rightly in advance,\u201d she said. \u201cBut people like Tesla and Einstein, they had the same gifts that I do. People like Beethoven and Bach had all their musical opus in its entirety and then had to work back to source. It\u2019s the same with inventors. They have an idea and have to figure out, \u2018how can I make this work.\u2019 It\u2019s science and spirituality marching hand-in-hand together.\u201d \n \nDoyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, and Houdini, the world\u2019s top illusionist of his time, were great friends before a dispute in 1923 over spiritualism \u2014 Doyle was a believer, Houdini wasn\u2019t \u2014 ended their friendship. For the last 10 years of his life, Edison tried to build a machine to talk to the dead, and Tesla certainly didn\u2019t rule out the value of spirituality, asserting that; \u201cThe day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.\u201d \n \nPublic\u2019s interest \nEven if most in the scientific community continue to scoff at spiritualism, there are indications that the general public\u2019s interest in that realm is growing. In 2007, Cobleskill psychic Corbie Mitleid listened to Elisabeth Rolfe\u2019s hopes and dreams of starting a business centered around spiritualism, and a decade later she\u2019s getting enough traffic that the Crossroads Gifts and Wellness is still a major presence on Jay Street in Schenectady. Rolfe, a Schoharie County native, met Mitleid at a psychic fair in Schenectady a little more than 10 years ago. \n \n\u201cI was in the spiritual manifesting stages of birthing my business and was seeking some clarity as to whether this was the path for me,\u201d said Rolfe, who moved her store from Schoharie to Schenectady four years ago. \u201cHer reading very quickly focused on my desire to offer the community a place where like minds could come together, and her message was to go for it, and that my vision would eventually be a success but with the warning that the first few years would be challenging.\u201d \n \nAccording to Austin, the field of spiritualism is growing because more people are realizing that to some degree, they have the gift themselves. \n \n\u201cI fought against it for a while, trying to use the logical and scientific side of my brain,\u201d said Austin, \u201cbut eventually I realized that there were very smart people who were interested in all of it, the mind, body and spirit. We all have some sort of gift. We just to have work at bringing them forward.\u201d \nReach Gazette reporter Bill Buell at 395-3190 or bbuell@dailygazette.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Bill Buell/Gazette reporter"},"topics":[{"name":"New York metro area news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Spiritualism gaining in popularity","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Schenectady","zipCode":"12308","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Schenectady","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Schenectady Daily Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675772","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"17"},"name":"Schenectady Daily Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailygazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197583965","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The concert, advertised as the guys' farewell concert appearance, was held in San Francisco on Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 25, 1976. The party attracted stars like Muddy Waters, Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell, Eric Clapton and Van Morrison. Ringo Starr, Paul Butterfield, Ronnie Wood, Neil Young and Dr. John also stopped by. \n \nThe show lives on, with an assist from Martin Scorsese. The film director had cameras inside San Fran's Winterland Ballroom and edited songs and interviews into 1978's \"The Last Waltz\" movie, acclaimed as one of the greatest concert films ever made. \n \nWas and his pals have said hello to the classic material and have brought back the live show. \"Last Waltz New Orleans\" was a monster hit at the city's Jazz Fest in 2016 and the \"Waltz\" ensemble later decided to take the music and run for an 11-stop tour that includes Albany, Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington. \n \nThe Albany show will be held Thursday, Feb. 2 at the Palace Theatre. Curtain is 8 p.m. Fans can expect favorites like \"Up on Cripple Creek,\" \"Stage Fright,\" \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,\" \"The Weight\" and bunches of others. \n \nThey can also expect a crowded stage. Warren Haynes of the Allman Brothers and southern jam outfit Gov't Mule, Michael McDonald, Bob Margolin - Muddy Waters' longtime partner - Dave Malone of New Orleans' Radiators, Ivan Neville and country musician Jamey Johnson are all on the team. \n \n\"The band itself that we're touring with is an odd-enough collection,\" said Was, who led the 1980s funk band Was (Not Was) and has been president of the Blue Note jazz music label since 2012. He was co-producer for the Rolling Stones' latest album, the well-regarded \"Blue and Lonesome.\" \n \n\"You really don't expect Michael McDonald, Warren Haynes and Jamey Johnson to blend,\"  Was said in a telephone interview from the beach in Hollywood, Florida, where the tour opens Saturday. \"It seemed like a real unlikely thing and when we first did it in New Orleans last year, it could have gone either way, man. It could have been a train wreck or it could have been something great, but we clicked from the first rehearsal. Everyone playing in the band was really knocked out. that doesn't always happen. Usually, it doesn't. This is a serious band and it's a great honor to play with these guys.\" \n \n  \n \nWas, 64, is only talking about \"Last Waltz\" during this round of interviews - so no questions about the Rolling Stones, no questions about jazz. He doesn't think anyone will ever duplicate the Band's big sounds from Thanksgiving 1976. \n \n  \n \n\"I watched it recently and nobody's ever going to re-create that night, man,\" he said. \"Neil Diamond is a buddy of mine and I was asking him about it. It's just hard to imagine all those people on the stage. Even he said everyone was kind of awed by the gathering that night.\" \n \n  \n \nWas is playing Rick Danko's notes for the tour. \n \n  \n \n\"He was a big influence on me as a young man,\" he said. \"There's something very Detroit about his playing in that if you really examine how he's approaching songs, he's approaching it like an R&B player. He and Levon, if you just isolated their tracks you'd think you were listening to and R&B group, but the songs that go on top of that groove are quite different to me. That's the Detroit tradition. I grew up with Mitch Ryder, who's a rock 'n' roll guy but had a very serious R&B foundation, that's kind of the Detroit sound.\" \n \n  \n \nWaltz musicians want to be respectful and faithful to the original versions, but they also want to take possession of the tunes, if only for a short time. \n \n  \n \n\"The songs lend themselves to stretching,\" Was said. \"So far, we've done this three times and every time the songs have been different.\" \n \n  \n \nHe hopes Robertson and Hudson find their ways to one of the shows. He has already prepared himself for that feeling - playing music for the people who made it famous. \n \n  \n \n\"A couple years ago I was the music director on a CBS show that celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Beatles being on Ed Sullivan and McCartney and Ringo were on the show,\" Was said. \"When McCartney wasn't playing bass, I was and for a lot of it he was sitting in the front row and I knew he was going to be sitting right in front of me; I also knew I wouldn't be a bass player if it wasn't for Paul McCartney, so I was determined to treat the songs respectfully and I studied like crazy, man. I got the Beatle multi-tracks isolated, learned his parts and  listened to what he does now. \n \n  \n \n\"Sometimes, things just happened on the day of the sessions and never recurred,\" Was added, \"but some of the parts are essential, you learn to distill the essential from the things that just happened in the moment and I was OK with it. It was intimidating in concert, but I was prepared for it.\" \n \n  \n \nWas believes Robertson and Hudson would be happy with the \"Waltz\" bands' re-creation. \"I've heard Robbie likes it and I've played with Garth ... it would be great if both those guys showed up,\" Was said. \"If they were sitting in the front row I'd go down and grab them and make them play.\" \n \n  \n \nAnyone could be leading the band. Haynes, long known for his associations with the Allmans, the Dicky Betts Band and Dead and Friends, co-founded Gov't Mule in 1994. Michael McDonald and Jamey Johnson have also led their own bands. \n \n  \n \n\"You could call anyone the musical director,\" Was said of the Waltz band, which will close its quick tour Feb. 4 in Washington. \"Warren and I were there first, so we took it.\" \n \n  \n \nAll the guys are just happy to have a spot on stage, and playing in a group that only rarely convenes. Everyone's working, there are obligations for other projects, but a chance to play \"Last Waltz\" songs was a powerful incentive. \n \n  \n \n\"Everybody cleared the time,\" Was said. \"This is just about fun.\" \n \n  \n \nReach Gazette reporter Jeff Wilkin at 395-3124 or at wilkin@dailygazette.com or @jeffwilkin1 on Twitter.

Protests have taken place in several US airports as speculation mounts that a group of US states will launch a legal challenge against President Trump's immigration order. An Iraqi pleaded for his life to Donald Trump, a Syrian-born New Yorker wondered how he would get home and church groups stared in dismay at homes prepared for refugee families who may never arrive. Despair and confusion set in among citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries who suddenly found themselves unable to enter the United States a day after President Trump signed an order he said was necessary to stop \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from coming to America.\n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the US by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the US refugee programme. Travellers from those nations were either barred from getting on their flights or detained at US airports after they landed, including tourists, foreign students and people trying to visit friends and family.\n\n\"What's next? What's going to happen next?\" said Mohammed al Rawi, an Iraqi-born American citizen, after his 69-year-old father, coming to visit his grandchildren in California, was detained and sent back to Iraq after 12 hours in custody. \"Are they going to create camps for Muslims and put us in it?\"\n\nAfter an appeal from civil liberties lawyers, a federal judge in New York issued an emergency order barring the US from summarily deporting people who had arrived with valid visas or an approved refugee application, but the ruling affected only a portion of Mr Trump's order. A group of state attorneys general are discussing whether to file their own court challenge against President Donald Trump's order to restrict people from seven Muslim-majority countries entering the United States, officials in three states told Reuters.\n\nOfficials in the offices of attorneys general in Pennsylvania, Washington and Hawaii said on Saturday they were evaluating what specific claims could be filed, and in which court. Protests broke out at several US airports where travellers were being held, including a gathering of several hundred people outside San Francisco's main airport and a raucous demonstration of at least 2,000 people at New York's Kennedy International Airport.\n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh, a translator and assistant for the US military in Iraq for 10 years, now fleeing death threats, was among at least a dozen people detained at Kennedy on Friday and Saturday. He was released after his lawyers and two members of the US Congress went to the airport to try to gain his release.\n\n\"This is the soul of America,\" Mr Darweesh told demonstrators and reporters, adding that the US was home to \"the greatest people in the world\". Others were less lucky - Parisa Fasihianifard, 24, arrived after a long trip from Tehran, in Iran, only to be detained and told she had to go home.\n\n\"She was crying and she told me she was banned to come inside and go through the gates,\" said her husband Mohamad Zandian , 26, an Iranian doctoral student at Ohio State University. Staff at US agencies that resettle refugees, several in tears, were scrambling to analyse the order and prepared for the wrenching phone calls that would have to be made to thousands just days away from travelling to the US.\n\nMeathaq Alaunaibi, a refugee from Iraq, was hoping to soon be reunited with her twin 18-year-old daughters who are in Baghdad and was \"crying all the time\".\n\nShe, her husband, a son and another daughter were settled in Tennessee last August, as the twins completed their government review to enter the US. \"They (her daughters) are so worried and afraid because they're stuck there in Baghdad,\" she said.\n\nAn Iraqi in Mosul, where the Islamic State terror group had seized control, despaired at word that what he had thought was an imminent flight to safety in America was now cancelled indefinitely.\n\n\"If you can write to Mr Trump or find any other way to help me reunite with my family, please, I am dying in Iraq, please,\" the man, whose identity was withheld because he is still in danger in Iraq, wrote back to his US lawyer by email. The order also caused confusion for longtime, legal US residents travelling abroad.\n\nKinan Azmeh, a clarinetist born in Syria who has lived in the US for 16 years, left his home in New York City three weeks ago for a series of concerts that included a date with cellist Yo-Yo Ma, but does not know if he will be able to return.\n\n\"It (New York City) is home as much as Damascus\", he said by phone from Lebanon. Before Mr Trump signed the order, more than 67,000 refugees had been approved by the government to enter the US, said Jen Smyers, refugee policy director for Church World Service.\n\nMore than 6,400 had already been booked on flights, including 15 families that had been expected over the next few weeks in the Chicago area from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Iran, Syria and Uganda.\n\nMost refugees entering the US are settled by religious groups which liaise with churches, synagogues and mosques to collect furniture, clothes and toys for the refugees and set up volunteer schedules for hosting duties. In Massachusetts, Jewish Family Service of MetroWest had been co-ordinating a group of doctors, community leaders, a local mosque and other volunteers to resettle 15 Syrian families.\n\nNow, two fully-outfitted apartments remain empty and it is unclear when, if ever, the other refugees will be allowed to enter, said Marc Jacobs, the group's chief executive.\n\nNour Ulayyet of Valparaiso, Indiana, said her sister, a Syrian living in Saudi Arabia, was sent back after arriving from Riyadh at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Saturday and told she could not enter the US to help care for their sick mother. Ms Ulayyet said some airport officials were apologising to her sister, who had a valid visa.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Thousands protest as states plot challenge against Trump's immigration order","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"IE","country":"Ireland"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Irish Independent","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660181","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"290"},"name":"Irish Independent","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://independent.ie"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.carsireland.ie/","http://www.carsireland.ie/index.php","http://www.carsireland.ie/car-dealers/","http://www.irishjobs.ie/?cid=Partner_INM_JobSearchBoxUrl","http://www.themeetingpoint.ie/?utm_source=independent&utm_campaign=navbar&utm_term=unknown","http://www.themeetingpoint.ie/mature-dating/?utm_source=independent&utm_campaign=navbar&utm_term=unknown","http://www.themeetingpoint.ie/gay-dating/?utm_source=independent&utm_campaign=navbar&utm_term=unknown","http://www.inotices.ie/","http://www.inotices.ie/death-notices","https://www.fitlive.ie/","https://www.fitlive.ie/events/","https://www.fitlive.ie/training/","https://www.hotelscombined.ie/?a_aid=143290&label=Hotels-tab","https://www.clickandgo.com/special-offers?utm_source=HolidayDeals&utm_medium=Content&utm_term=HolidayDeals&utm_content=HolidayDeals&utm_campaign=HolidayDeals%20Link","https://www.facebook.com/Independent.ie","https://twitter.com/Independent_ie","https://plus.google.com/116623388763634190489","http://livefyre.com/","http://livefyre.com/?ref_noscript","http://www.farmireland.ie/","http://www.inm.ie/contact/","http://www.inm.ie/"],"sequenceId":"695197585991","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:34Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article35406493.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/tr001.jpg"},{"url":"http://cdn-04.independent.ie/incoming/article35406493.ece/82be7/AUTOCROP/w620h342/tr001.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

As a lead up she placed second at the NXN New York regional race.  \n\n\u201cShe loves the competition,\u201d Saratoga co-coach Linda Kranick said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t shy away from it.\u201d \n\nChmiel\u2019s impressive runs included course records at Saratoga Spa State Park (3.05 miles, 16:41.72) when she defended her Suburban Council championship, and at Chenango Valley State Park (5K, 17:17.50) when she captured the New York State Public High School Athletic Association Class A title. A victory at the New York State Federation Championships at Bowdoin Park in Wappingers Falls followed (5K, 18:10.20). \n\n\u201cI knew I wanted to improve on my freshman season,\u201d the 15-year-old Chmiel said. \u201cIf I ran on a course before, I wanted to be faster. For the most part I did that.\u201d \n\nChmiel placed third at the NYSPHSAA and Federation races in 2015, the season she began her cross country career. With her wins this past season, she became Section II\u2019s first Class A female runner to pull off the double since Saratoga\u2019s Nicole Blood in 2004. \n\n\u201cIt makes a coach feel tremendous when you have an athlete who has trust in their coaches and who works so hard and is rewarded for that work,\u201d said Kranick, who, with her husband Art, directs the Blue Streaks. \u201cShe earned that success.\u201d \n\nChmiel was particularly pleased with her run at the Suburban Council meet when she broke the course record of 16:41.9 that was set by Davis in 2004. \n\n\u201cSuburban was a good day for me,\u201d Chmiel, who led the Blue Streaks to the team title, said. \u201cI knew I wanted to get a fast time, but I wasn\u2019t expecting to do that. I was feeling good that day.\u201d \n\nAnd when she\u2019s not feeling so good? \n\n\u201cWe all have those off days,\u201d Chmiel said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep working through it and don\u2019t get discouraged. You\u2019ve got to think about there being more good days ahead.\u201d \n\nChmiel defended her Section II Class A title (16:47.71) at Saratoga Spa State Park and notched victories earlier in the season at the Great Meadow Invitational in Virginia (5K, 17:36.00) and Wingfoot XC Classic in Georgia (5K, 17:17.60), setting course records at both events. \n\n\u201cIt was good to have some good races in the beginning of the season,\u201d Chmiel said. \u201cIt shows you are improving and makes you want to keep working.\u201d \n\nStill relatively new to the cross country game, Chmiel has plans to do just that. \n\n\u201cUsually I get out faster than I want to,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I have to work really hard at the end because I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m not a good pacer. It\u2019s another thing to work on.\u201d \nThe New York Gatorade award is based on athletic achievement as well as academics, sportsmanship, character and community service. As the recipient, she is a finalist for Gatorade\u2019s national cross country award. \n\n\u201cIt definitely is exciting, but I still have two years to go,\u201d Chmiel said of the honors that have come her way. \u201cThere\u2019s more to do. You\u2019ve got to think there is always someone out there working harder than you.\u201d \n\nChmiel is diligent away from the athletic scene. She has a high 90s classroom average (math is her favorite subject) and plays the saxaphone in the high school\u2019s symphonic band.  \n\n\u201cShe is a great kid,\u201d Kranick said. \u201cShe is a good student.

I'm not going to stir the hornet's nest, but a number of other teams have had the opportunity to control where they've played this year.\"\n\nAnother sticking point is training.\n\nUnited can train throughout the week at McKellar for minimal cost, but would get limited access to Canberra Stadium.\n\nLast time the Mariners were in town, Canberra played its season opener against Melbourne City as part of a Canberra Stadium double-header, losing that game 2-1.\n\nThey were unable to train on the ground in the lead-up to that match.\n\nUnited co-captain Ellie Brush reiterated Dower's preference, but added they'd be ready regardless of where the game was.\n\n\"This is our favoured home, but ... we don't really mind where we suit up, we know the crowd will get out and support us. Just two more [wins] to go,\" she said.\n\nDower said Brush's fellow co-captain Michelle Heyman was unlikely to be ready for the semi, although she had returned to training with the main group as she continued her comeback from toe and ankle injuries.\n\nThe Matildas striker has been out since she rolled her ankle against the Melbourne Victory at the end of December.\n\n\"She was back training [Friday], which was a great sight to see her out here at McKellar juggling, jogging laps, kicking the ball around,\" Dower said.\n\n\"It was really great. Next week might be asking too much, but at least she's back in the frame now and she's running herself around.\"\n\nW-LEAGUE SEMI-FINAL\n\nCanberra United v Melbourne City\n\nA-LEAGUE ROUND 18\n\nSunday: Central Coast Mariners v Adelaide United at Canberra Stadium, 5pm.

She owns a comparatively humble semi at Northbridge, in her Willoughby electorate. Photo: Daniel Munoz \n    exit   \nSydney's booming spring property market has delivered the new Berejiklian government a budget windfall. \n \nThe amount of residential stamp duty flowing into the state coffers hit new monthly records in November and December, Office of State Revenue figures show. \n \nThe NSW government collected $730 million from the residential property transfers last month alone \u2013 about $100 million more than the previous December. November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier. \n \nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts. \n \nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July. \n \nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier. \n \nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016. \n \nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256. \n \nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years. \n \nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability. \n \nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\". \n \nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\". \n \nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year. \n \nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets. \n \nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16. \n \nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year. \n \nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion. \n \nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2777","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Springwood","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Blue Mountains Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661357","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Blue Mountains Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bluemountainsgazette.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197598416","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Their goaltender has allowed 17 goals in the last three games. Their once-effective penalty kill has given up eight goals in the last two games. They're seven points behind second-place Castlegar and just one point ahead of Grand Forks. \n \nAnd there's just six games left in the regular season to course correct. But despite all the numbers against them, the Leafs still went down swinging Saturday in a 5-3 loss to the Fernie Ghostriders. \n \n\"We showed some resiliency and never took a shift off,\" said defenceman Jacob Karran, who scored his first goal of the season. \"I thought we haven't played that well in a while.\" \n \nKeagan Kingwell had a hat trick while Tayler Sincennes and Alex Cheveldave also scored for the Ghostriders (23-14-3) who won their third straight game. Brandon Youngson made 30 saves in Fernie's net. \n \nMason Mullaney and Jack Karran also replied for the Leafs (18-18-5). Devin Allen allowed four goals on 25 shots before being replaced by Jared Martin, who stopped eight shots. \n \nThe Leafs were missing so many players that defenceman Dash Thompson was moved up to forward for the game. Nelson is currently without top scorers Dale Howell and Sawyer Hunt as well as defenceman Brent Headon, who were each suspended for their roles in a fight last Saturday against Castlegar. \n \nThe league also retroactively suspended Alex Meeker three games for accumulated checking to the head minors. Nelson lost an appeal to the league to have the suspensions overruled, and Leafs coach Mario DiBella said the team intends to take their appeal to BC Hockey. \n \nDespite that, the Leafs who did play compensated for the short bench with tenacious play. \n \n\"Even though we were short on bodies the players who played certainly stuck to the gameplan and executed what we expect from them,\" said DiBella. \"The results were there on the scoreboard with the amount of puck possession we had.\" \n \nThe absence of Nelson's injured top netminder Billy Gorn, whose status is uncertain for the remainder of the season, lingered throughout the game. \n \nAllen was yanked after another rough outing, paving the way for Nelson native Jared Martin. The rookie looked solid in his first appearance for Nelson. He stopped one breakaway, made another save with his helmet and later denied two quick shots to keep the Leafs in the game. \n \nMartin, who previously tried out for the Leafs in training camp and has been playing defence in midget house, earned praise for his abbreviated appearance from DiBella. \n \n\"I thought Jared was outstanding,\" said DiBella. \"I thought he was athletic, he tracked the puck real well, he played big, he followed the puck across the crease and he gave us an opportunity to win in the third period.\" \n \nThe opening period was notable for a pair of big hits. Fernie forward Nolan Legace was dumped upside down into the Leafs bench, while later on Nelson's Sam Weber was laid out on the boards and went hard to the ice. \n \nFernie went on the power play and it paid off moments after the puck was dropped. Kingwell whipped a point shot that beat Allen at 6:17 to put the visitors up 1-0. \n \nNelson left it late to find the equalizer. Nicholas Wihak did the work, carrying the puck into the zone and shooting a wrister that rebounded off Youngson's pads straight to Mullaney, who had the easy shot to score at 1:29. \n \nThat ended up being Wihak's highlight of an abbreviated night. Not long after he was charged with a check from behind and tossed from the game. \n \nBoth teams shared a pair of quick goals to start the second period. \n \nJacob Karran's point shot surprised Youngson at 18:52. But the Leafs' lead lasted exactly 12 seconds after Sincennes beat Allen before Karran's goal had been announced. \n \nFrom there it was all Fernie. Kingwell found the back of the net with a power-play point shot at 11:22, then Cheveldave had a point shot of his own go in on the man advantage five minutes later for a 4-2 lead. \n \nThat goal ended Allen's night, who was yanked for backup Martin. \n \nIt was the Leafs once again who struck first in the third. Jack Karran, who was promoted to the top line, hustled to catch up to a bouncing puck on a breakaway. Karran managed to collect the puck just in time to skate in front of Youngson and squeak a shot past the netminder. \n \n\"Once I touched it I almost lost it there, but I think that's maybe what threw the goalie off a bit,\" he said. \n \nDiBella said after the game he thinks Jack Karran is the Leafs' most improved player this season. The rookie forward has eight goals and eight assists in 34 games so far. \n \nHe was just one short Saturday. Kingwell scored an empty-net goal with 39 seconds left to punctuate another disappointing night for Nelson. \n \n\"Everyone worked hard. We're short a couple guys but it's no excuse,\" said Jack Karran. \"We were hoping for a better outcome I guess but that's the way it happens sometimes.\" \n \nLeaflets: Kidsport honoured its volunteers at the game. The organization, which provides financial assistance to children who want to play sports, is celebrating its 10th anniversary. The Nelson chapter was also awarded a $3,000 cheque by the B.C. Legacy Fund, as well as a $1,200 gift from the Nelson Lions Club. ... D Michael LeNoury returned to the Leafs after a brief Junior A call-up. ...

Coming into Saturday\u2019s game against the Rio Grande Valley Vipers both teams are fighting for the fourth and final spot in the Western Conference. \n \nLuckily for the Warriors, they walked off the court clinging on to a small lead in the playoff push after they defeated the Vipers 123-115 in front of a full house on Saturday night at Kaiser Permanente Arena. \n \nThe Warriors \u2014 who shot franchise single-game record 60.6 percent on 3-point shot attempts Friday night \u2014 saw guard Scott Wood set a career mark after he shot 50 percent (10 of 20) on long-range shots. He finished with a game-high 32 points. \n \n\u201cHe\u2019s great\u201d Warriors coach Casey Hill said. \u201cAnytime he gets open that many times, he\u2019s capable of doing that.\u201d \n \nHill said he was actually surprised that Wood didn\u2019t make more 3-point shots. \n \n\u201cHe is one of the best shooters I\u2019ve ever coached,\u201d Hill said. \u201cHe\u2019s confident, without being cocky, when it comes to his shooting, which allows his teammates to basically really grasp on to that.\u201d \n \nThe Warriors, who are in second place in the Pacific Division behind Los Angeles, gained some ground with the win. They sit just five games behind the D-Fenders. \n \nIt was the first set of back-to-back games for Santa Cruz (16-12) since the beginning of January when they played against Austin and Rio Grande Valley. It was also the last time the Warriors faced the Vipers when they lost in a shootout, 155-148, in Hidalgo, Texas. \n \nSanta Cruz now leads the season series against the Vipers 2-1. \n \nThe Vipers started the game with a 10-2 run led behind center Chinanu Onuaku\u2019s five points. Wood hit back-to-back 3-pointer to make it 13-8. \n \nThe Vipers\u2019 JP Tokoto was fouled hard by Warriors guard Alex Hamilton but managed to make a spectacular shot under the hoop with a little more than two minutes to go in the first quarter. The three-point play extended RGV\u2019s lead to 28-19. \n \nRio Grande Valley forced the Warriors to turn the ball over seven times in the first quarter and at one point had a 14-point lead. Hamilton led the Warriors with eight points in the first quarter, including a buzzer beating layup. Still, the Vipers had a 34-23 lead. \n \n \nWood started to heat up in the second quarter after he knocked in his third 3-point shot with a little less than nine minutes to go on the game clock but the Warriors never seemed to get close enough to tie or take the lead. \n \nWood added three more 3-pointers to give him 18 points at the half and the Warriors trailed by just three, 61-58. \n \nWood continued to shine and gave Santa Cruz its first lead of the game, 70-67, after his first 3-point bucket of the second half with eight minutes left in the third quarter. Wood put in two more 3-pointers to extend the Warriors lead to 11 points at 82-71. \n \nThe Warriors started the fourth quarter with an 18-point lead but things got a little interesting in the final two minutes of the game after RGV pulled to within four points, 117-113. But the Vipers couldn\u2019t complete the comeback. \n \n\u201cUnder a 100 points,\u201d Hill said about trying to hold RGV under a specific amount of points. \u201cI don\u2019t care what your philosophy is or how you play, I want to hold teams to under a 100.\u201d \n \nHill said it was doable, especially after allowing the Vipers to score just 17 points in the third quarter. \n \n\u201cKudos to them for not giving up,\u201d Hill said. \n \nRGV guard Darius Morris nearly finished with triple-double as he scored a team-high 24 points to go along with nine assists and nine rebounds. Not far behind was Tokoto, who finished with 22 points and Onuaku had 17 points. \n \nThe Vipers, who are in third place in the Southwest Division, fall to 17-13. \n \nWarriors guard Phil Pressey on the other hand recorded a triple-double as he finished with 15 points, 13 assists and 14 rebounds.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 13 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"64108","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kansas City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kansas City Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667893","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1100"},"name":"Kansas City Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kmbc.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197613331","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They started out playing together in Compton, hardly a hotbed for tennis, with their father Richard and mother Oracene as coach and mentor. And they still practice and travel together around the world. \n \nThey met for the first time at a major at Melbourne Park in 1998 \u2014 Venus won that one. In 2003, when the younger of the Williams siblings completed her \u201cSerena Slam\u201d of four consecutive titles, Venus was on the other side of the net. She didn\u2019t reach another Australian final for 14 years. \n \nWhen Serena sat on the court, holding both arms up to celebrate on Saturday, Venus walked over to her sister\u2019s side of the net for a hug. \n \n\u201cThis was a tough one,\u201d Serena said. \u201cI really would like to take this moment to congratulate Venus, she\u2019s an amazing person \u2014 she\u2019s my inspiration. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I would be at 23 without her \u2014 there\u2019s no way I would be at one without her. Thank you Venus for inspiring me to be the best player I can be and inspiring me to work hard.\u201d \n \nAsked if it felt awkward to be on the receiving end of so many losses to her sister, the 36-year-old Venus didn\u2019t flinch. \n \n\u201cNo, because I guess I\u2019ve been here before,\u201d she said. \u201cI really enjoy seeing the name Williams on the trophy. This is a beautiful thing.\u201d \n \nVenus won the last of her seven majors in 2008 at Wimbledon. She didn\u2019t make the second week of a major for a few years as she came to terms with an energy-sapping illness after being diagnosed with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome in 2011. And she only made it back to the semifinals last year at Wimbledon. \n \nAnother shot at a first Australian Open title was a sign of progress, she said. \n \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly where I want to be standing during these Grand Slams, is on finals day, having an opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the highlight of all this, is to be in that moment.\u201d \n \nSerena Williams, meanwhile, enjoyed the fact she made history in Melbourne. Only Margaret Court, with 24, is in front of her in terms of overall Grand Slam singles titles, although the Australian great won 13 of her Grand Slams before the Open era began in 1968. \n \n\u201cMy first Grand Slam started here, and getting to 23 here, but playing Venus, it\u2019s stuff that legends are made of,\u201d Serena said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have written a better story.\u201d \n \nThe match didn\u2019t live up to its classic billing, with nerves and tension causing uncharacteristic mistakes and unforced errors, with four consecutive service breaks before Venus finally held for a 3-2 lead in the first set. That included a game when Serena had game point but served back-to-back double-faults and three in all to give up the break. \n \nThere were six service breaks in total. Both players were relatively subdued, except when Serena smashed her racket in the third game. \n \nAfter the fourth game, however, Serena Williams didn\u2019t face another break point in the 1-hour, 22-minute match. \n \n\u201cSerena Williams, that\u2019s my little sister,\u201d Venus said. \u201cI have been right there with you. Some of them I have lost right there against you.

A lawsuit brought by states would heighten the legal stakes surrounding the president's executive order, signed late on Friday, as courtroom challenges to the ban have so far mostly been filed by individuals. \n \nOfficials in the offices of attorneys general in Pennsylvania, Washington and Hawaii said on Saturday they were evaluating what specific claims could be filed, and in which court. \n \n\"We do believe the executive order is unconstitutional,\" Hawaii attorney general Douglas Chin told Reuters on Saturday. He declined to give further detail. \n \nThe states could decide not to file, and it is unclear how many states would ultimately sign on for such an effort. \n \n\"There certainly are conversations underway,\" said Joe Grace, a spokesman for Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro. \n \nA Trump representative could not be reached immediately for comment. \n \nTrump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. He told reporters in the Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \"not a Muslim ban\" and said the measures were long overdue. \n \nHowever, his order hit a roadblock late on Saturday when a federal judge in New York said stranded travelers could stay in the country. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the emergency court order, said it would help 100 to 200 people with valid visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports after Trump signed the order. \n \nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it would comply with judicial orders but that Trump's immigration restrictions remained in effect.

New coach Bruce Arena\u2019s MLS-based player group is clearly optimistic about the tests ahead, but the U.S. needs immediate improvements after two losses late last year put the Americans at the bottom of their World Cup qualifying group. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a new vibe,\u201d Feilhaber said. \u201cIt\u2019s been great. Everybody is fighting for positions, but united in the knowledge that we need to do something special this year in qualifying, and it starts in this camp.\u201d \n \nFeilhaber is an offensive midfielder who could provide a dimension that seemed lacking in the Americans\u2019 attack in recent months. He is just one of several players getting newfound looks and increased attention after fading from Klinsmann\u2019s favor. \n \nDax McCarty, Chris Pontius and Chad Marshall also might have thought they were all done with U.S. national team play after getting passed over by the German coach. Other younger MLS-based players, including Sebastian Lletget and Walker Zimmerman, still hadn\u2019t attracted Klinsmann\u2019s serious attention. \n \nWhen Klinsmann was fired and Arena took over late last year, the veterans had already made their usual January vacation plans \u2014 and McCarty even scheduled his wedding this month. \n \nThey all reported to Carson for the start of another run under Arena, who has been determined to keep an open mind about anyone who could help his team. \n \n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to prove anything extra,\u201d Arena said of the second-chance contingent. \u201cBut they\u2019ve demonstrated they\u2019re good players, and they\u2019ve convinced me that they\u2019re options. At the end of the day, we\u2019ve got to compile all of this stuff after this camp and then look at our pool of players that are in Europe as well as in Mexico and try to see what makes sense for the games in March. It\u2019s not going to be an easy exercise, for sure.\u201d \n \n \nThe match in San Diego is Arena\u2019s first for the U.S. team since June 22, 2006, when the Americans were eliminated from the World Cup with a 2-1 loss to Ghana at Nuremberg. After his first U.S. tenure ended, Arena moved on to build the LA Galaxy into a three-time MLS champion. \n \nFrom veteran Jermaine Jones to youngster Jordan Morris, the MLS-based players appear to appreciate Arena\u2019s confident style of management \u2014 while realizing the results will determine his real success. \n \n\u201cBruce is very open with his players,\u201d Feilhaber said. \u201cHe lets you know exactly what he expects from you, and he\u2019s been very clear with me what position he would like me to play in, and what my responsibilities would be for the team. It\u2019s very straightforward and easy to grasp what my job is.

You see it at the airports, you see it all over,' Trump said. \n \nAlong with Syria, the ban affects travellers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n \nThe Department of Homeland Security said about 375 travellers had been affected by the order, 109 of whom were in transit and were denied entry to the United States. Another 173 were stopped by airlines before boarding. \n \nThe new rules blindsided people in transit and families waiting for them, and caused havoc for businesses with employees holding passports from the targeted nations and colleges with international students. \n \nPegah Rahmani, 25, waited at Washington's Dulles airport for several hours for her grandparents, both Iranian citizens with US green cards. 'They weren't treating them very well,' she said. \n \nRahmani's grandfather is 88 and legally blind. Her grandmother is 83 and recently had a stroke. They were released to loud cheers and cries. \n \nSeveral Democratic governors said they were examining whether they could launch legal challenges, and other groups eyed a constitutional challenge claiming religious discrimination. \n \n'I don't think anyone is going to take this lying down,' said Cleveland immigration lawyer David Leopold. 'This is the tip of the spear and more litigation is coming.' \n \nThe White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Senior officials at the US Department of Homeland Security told reporters the government would implement any appropriate orders. \n \nHowever, Mark Krikorian, the director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, called such lawsuits 'last ditch efforts' that would only apply to a few individuals, and he said a broader constitutional argument would be hard to win. \n \n'The first amendment doesn't apply to foreigners living abroad. The law explicitly says the president can exclude any person or class of people he wants,' Krikorian said. \n \nSome leaders from the US technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, issued warnings to their staff and called the order immoral and un- American. \n \n'This ban will impact many innocent people,' said Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc UBER.UL, who said he would raise the issue at a White House meeting on Friday. \n \nArab travellers in the Middle East and North Africa said the order was humiliating and discriminatory. Iran vowed to retaliate. \n \nSudan called the action 'very unfortunate' after Washington lifted sanctions on the country just weeks ago for cooperation on combating terrorism. A Yemeni official expressed dismay at the ban. \n \nIraq's former ambassador to the United States, Lukman Faily, told Reuters that Trump's ban was unfair to a country that itself has been a victim of terror attacks, and could backfire. \n \n'We have a strong partnership with U.S., more so in the urgent fight against terrorism. This ban move will not help, and people will start questioning the bond of this partnership, Faily said. \n \nAllies in the United Kingdom, France and Germany were critical. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted a photo of himself welcoming Syrian refugees. \n \nConfusion abounded at airports as immigration and customs officials struggled to interpret the new rules. Some legal residents with green cards who were in the air when the order was issued were detained at airports upon arrival. \n \nHowever, senior administration officials said it would have been 'reckless' to broadcast details of the order in advance. \n \nOther officials said green card holders from the affected countries would require extra screening and would be cleared on a case-by-case basis. \n \nAirlines were blindsided and some cabin crew were barred from entering the country. \n \nTravellers were handled differently at different points of entry and immigration lawyers advised clients to change their destination to the more lenient airports, said Houston immigration lawyer Mana Yegani. \n \nReuters","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US immigration news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Global news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests erupt over US immigration laws","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2059","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"North Sydney","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Sky News Australia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658630","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"25"},"name":"Sky News Australia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.skynews.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197645820","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council. \n \nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet. \n \nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney. \n \nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families. \n \nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\". \n \nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections. \n \nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies. \n \nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\". \n \nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts. \n \nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state. \n \nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs. \n \nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean. \n \nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts. \n \nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation. \n \nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader. \n \nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres. \n \nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts. \n \nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities. \n \nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing. \n \nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence. \n \nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following  Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics  after being told she could not remain in the portfolio. \n \nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment. \n \nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance. \n \nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected. \n \nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\". \n \n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" \n \nThe story Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019 first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2777","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Springwood","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Blue Mountains Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661357","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Blue Mountains Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bluemountainsgazette.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197646199","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He had fresh, frisky legs and then some on Saturday night and left the Los Angeles Clippers grabbing their own hamstrings. \n \nCurry had his best all-around eye-candy performance of the season and the Warriors followed his lead in an absolute 144-98 demolition of the Clippers at Oracle Arena. They shot 62.5 percent in exploding out to a 21-point halftime lead, then really dropped the hammer and pinned a 45-point third quarter on L.A. with their two-time MVP guard looking every bit the part of lead entertainer and destroyer. \n \nThe Clippers were playing without veteran point guard and leader Chris Paul, who is recovering from thumb surgery, but it\u2019s unlikely Paul would have made that much of a difference on this night, even if he\u2019d brought Michael Jordan along. The Warriors came out smoking from the start and simply took it their alleged rivals at both ends of the floor. It was a most impressive way to win their eighth straight against their Southern California foes and also post their NBA-best 40th victory against just seven losses. \n \nBut Curry was particularly energized, scoring 43 points to go with nine rebounds and six assists over a mere three quarters, and he finished the first half with a exclamation-point flourish like only he can. With just under 30 seconds to go, he made a ridiculous baseline bounce pass between the legs of the Clippers\u2019 Jamal Crawford to Andre Iguodala under the basket for a dunk. Iguodala was so wowed by it he couldn\u2019t hold back a chuckle. \n \nCurry was just getting started. As time ticked off under five seconds, Curry out-jumped 7-foot L.A. center DeAndre Jordan for a rebound, raced to mid-court and let fly with a 50-footer from the center circle that swished through with 1.7 seconds to go. It only added to Curry lore on such \u201cmiracle\u201d shots. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s probably a 50-50 chance it\u2019s going in, and I think that\u2019s pretty high,\u201d said Draymond Green. \u201cAfter you see something so many times, you just know there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s going to go.\u201d \n \nThe long bomb gave the Warriors a 72-51 lead and the Clippers were effectively finished. But Steph wasn\u2019t. He continued to light up Oracle in the third with a 25-point quarter that was vintage highest-level Curry. He made 8 of 11 shots, including 5 of 8 3-point tries and was plus-22 just for those 12 minutes alone as the Warriors expanded the lead to as many as 43. Curry outscored the Clippers all by himself in that quarter by two points. \n \n \nCurry was so dynamic, it allowed starting All-Star teammate Kevin Durant to have a \u201cquiet\u201d 23-point game in which he made 9 of 11 shots with seven assists. It was that kind of night. Even James Michael McAdoo went for double figures with 10. \n \nSo, Steph, about that quad tightness that had everyone worrying you might not even play .... \n \n\u201cSince we didn\u2019t have a shoot-around, I didn\u2019t know how it was going to react once I got moving and doing basketball activity,\u201d he said. \u201cI was pretty confident from the time I woke up that I was going to be able to go, but you don\u2019t really know until you get out on the court to test it out.\u201d \n \nAlready leading by 10, the Warriors\u2019 small lineup smacked the Clippers with a 17-6 run over the final 2 ½ minutes of the opening half and the rout was on. Curry said the half-court shot might have had some carryover effect, both for himself and his team. \n \n\u201cMy coach at Davidson, Bob McKillop, always talked about \u2018big mo\u2019 going into the half,\u201d Curry said. \u201cIf you can get a stop or a buzzer-beater, it usually has a carryover effect for the team. Me personally, you see a shot like that go in, you\u2019re obviously thinking about it at halftime, and I made my first shot coming out in the third quarter, so that just continued the trend.\u201d \n \nCurry joked that his rebound over Jordan was \u201can illusion\u201d and that his between-the-legs bounce pass to Iguodala was \u201cfrom the coach\u2019s eyes, probably one of those no-no-no-oh-good-pass situations.\u201d And speaking of \u201cbig mo,\u201d Curry also had a dribble-drive layup past ex-teammate Marreese \u201cMo Buckets\u201d Speights earlier in the game. \n \n\u201cIt was a good pick-and-roll situation, and I tried to get him activated,\u201d Curry said with a grin. \u201cWe can\u2019t it easy on him even though we love Mo around here.\u201d \n \nThe Warriors didn\u2019t take it easy on any of the Clippers, playing stout defense much of the night to set up their lethal transition offense. A signature play in the first half occurred when Green blocked powerful L.A. forward Blake Griffin driving to the rim, then raced to the end while Griffin was still gathering himself and blasted home a driving dunk. \n \n\u201cI thought Draymond was tremendous,\u201d said coach Steve Kerr. \u201cHis numbers aren\u2019t going to wow anybody, but his defense was phenomenal, and I thought that block he had on Blake was one of the key plays of the game just to fuel us. It got the crowd into it, and that\u2019s when we broke the game open.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Carl Steward Bay Area News Group"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Curry scores 43 as Golden State blasts Clippers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Santa Cruz","zipCode":"95060","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Santa Cruz","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Santa Cruz Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169679227","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"531"},"name":"Santa Cruz Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.santacruzsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197651573","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.santacruzsentinel.com/storyimage/NE/20170128/SPORTS/170129697/AR/0/AR-170129697.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But that's as close as they'd get.\n\nSentinel went on a 7-0 run on baskets by Matt Messerly, Sam Beighle and Griffin Line. Suddenly the cushion swelled to nine points, and the visitors had enough for the win, although they padded the margin outscoring the hosts 8-6 down the stretch.\n\nBeighle finished with a game-high 21 points, followed by CHS' McCarvel, who drained a trio of treys from downtown in three attempts, with 11.\n\n\"It's like having the same old film, and just hit replay,\" said Bruin coach Guy Almquist, referring to the opposition's runs during their 11-game losing skid. Capital slides to 1-11 overall and 0-4 in conference play with the loss. \"I just feel real bad for the kids after another great effort and not coming away with a W.\n\n\"We played good enough defense to keep them under 50 points, if not for having to foul and them making their free throws; but we just can't put the ball in the hole.\"\n\nCapital shot just 33 percent from the floor (12 for 36), compared to Sentinel's 44 percent (18-41).\n\nThe Spartans led 10-9 after the first quarter, and 19-18 at halftime.\n\nNext in the scoring column for the brown-and-gold were Brad Haller and Xavier Melice, at eight and seven points.\n\nSentinel's Mitch Roberts was the game's top rebounder with nine boards, while Melice was high for the home team with four rebounds. CHS teammate Mark Northey passed for four assists.\n\n\"Defensive stops and knocking down shots,\" answered Sentinel coach Jay Jagelski, when asked the keys to pulling away from the Bruins in the end. \"Capital did a good job staying in the game; they played tough defense. But we just ground it out -- we did well in the post, and our full-court man press was what made the difference.\"\n\nAmquist said his team is \"actually are doing a lot of things better,\" except shooting\n\n\"Not only did we miss shots, but we missed layups; and you can't win in AA by shooting 33 percent,\" he said. \"But I'm impressed by our guys, despite the losing streak. They're keeping their heads up, and they're coming to practice and working hard.

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Caboolture News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"607010784","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Caboolture News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.caboolturenews.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197675249","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T14:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557687z1_20170129162619_000g9dg4eu82-0-5o7dbx25uooe6wninn2_t325x200.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2622","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Braidwood","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Braidwood Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"348382630","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Braidwood Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.braidwoodtimes.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197686213","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It will be, he said, a time of fresh starts and new beginnings. \n\nFor the superstitious in China, this is the season when astrologers' services are in high demand to help guide important decisions regarding family, finance and health. \n\nGiven the growing anxiety in China about the new presidency \u2014 Trump has said he would challenge Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea and accused it of predatory trade practices \u2014 Chen forecasts an unstable period for international relations that will strain bilateral ties. \n\n\"China and the U.S. may have conflicts on trade, the South China Sea, and North Korea,\" he said. He added, perhaps predictably, that he believes China has the ability to weather the storm. \n\nAstrologically speaking, China's President Xi Jinping seems to have an edge over his U.S. counterpart, with a double dose of luck in his stars. His birthday falls under the fire sign, which, in the incoming year of the fire rooster, supposedly means great things. \n\nFor example, people who, like Xi, were born in year of the snake are poised to \"do well in finance,\" Chen said. \n\nIt will also be a prosperous time for those born in years of the ox, like former President Barack Obama, and the dragon, like Russian Vladimir Putin. \n\nUnfortunately, the financial good times do not extend to the rest of the astrological signs, especially rabbits and tigers. Chen advised people of those signs against sinking too much money into real estate or stocks, urging that they invest instead in their own health to avoid illness. \n\nThe Year of the Fire Rooster is the tenth year of the twelve-year zodiac cycle, and the characteristics associated with it are ambition, pride and the desire to be admired. \n\n\"Trump has his own fortune-teller team,\" said Chen. \"The easiest way for Western people to be lucky or make a lot of money would be to follow Trump's clothing style and the layout and decoration of his office.\" \n\nChen did not say whether good feng shui decor might include gold curtains. However, the plants recommended during a rooster year include narcissus, the gold-colored flower that represents fortune.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: television news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Donald Trump and the Year of the Fire Rooster: What's in Store?","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"NBCNews.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"274867882","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"NBCNews.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts","Television"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nbcnews.com","publisher":"National Broadcasting Company"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/beijing-strikes-back-white-house-draws-red-lines-over-south-n711401"],"sequenceId":"695197686686","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:47Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_04/1881086/170127-fire-rooster-cr-0625_06e65b5848028b321410cf44e949aecf.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"},{"url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2017_04/1881086/170127-fire-rooster-cr-0625_06e65b5848028b321410cf44e949aecf.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The idea of introducing the ORS 1 and 2; one in the Eastern Naval Command (ENC) and another in the Central Naval Command, is to continue to keep pressure on the criminal elements within the maritime environment. \n \n\u201dThrough this operation, the Nigerian Navy will be able to contain the nefarious activities of criminals in the area adequately.\u201d \n \nSpeaking on sea piracy, the Navy and other sister security organisations had successfully minimised their criminal activities, adding that only few isolated cases had been recoded. \n \n\u201dSea piracy has never been rampant. I will say we are doing our best to ensure that we keep the waterways safe for legitimate activities to take place\u201d, he said. \n \nGarba said that the medical outreach had become an aspect of the command\u2019s corporate social responsibility to its host communities, adding that it was the ninth edition of the programme. \n \nHe said the command shifted the focus of the programme to riverside communities and non-motorable villages without access to good medical services. \n \nThe FOC called on the beneficiaries to on assist the navy by providing useful information to combat crimes, especially in the maritime domains. \n \nThe residents were tested and treated for malaria, typhoid fever, diabetes, high blood pressure, hepartitis, among others. \n \nAlso, many children were dewormed and given immunisation treatment against polio and other ailments. \n \nAn indigene of the community and former Acting Governor of Bayelsa State, Mr. Nestor Binabo, commended the Navy for its gesture. \n \nBinabo said that the free medical outreach was the first of its kind in the community, adding that the intervention of the command came at a time many residents found it difficult to access medical care because of poverty. \n \nThe former acting governor said: \u201dThe naval establishment has been here in Bayelsa for sometime but the present FOC of the command is a fantatic person. \n \n\u201dThe exercise tells me that the command has the people of Bayelsa at heart. You know, a healthy man is a wealthy man. Today, you can see the number of persons that have come out to get medical examinations and treatments. It is no mean feat.

We can also provide deliveries to the elderly and handicapped who have difficulty getting around.\u201d \n \nThe company, which has its business office in London, engineering in Estonia and some 90 employees, announced in January it had raised $17.2 million, led by Daimler AG with other investors as it moves to expand its testing and partnerships. \n \nWhile the Starship robots roll at a modest pace of around four miles (six kilometers) per hour, Harris-Burland said they offer a more efficient and economical delivery model than drones, which are being tested by online retail giant Amazon and others. \n   Starship Technology spokesman Henry Harris-Burland says the founders are looking to \u201cdisrupt\u201d an industry which has seen little efficiency improvement from new technology | © AFP/File | MANDEL NGAN   \nThe rolling robots are far less expensive to build and operate than drones and face fewer regulatory issues. \n \nHe said drones might be better-suited to remote and rural areas, while the Starship bots are designed for cities and suburbs, where they can roll along on sidewalks. \n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t see these as competing with drones, we see it as complementary,\u201d Harris-Burland said. \n \nThe Starship robots, which look like high-tech plastic picnic coolers, can carry about 20 pounds (nine kilograms) of goods, suited to three to four grocery bags. They do not offer heating or chilled compartments because rapid deliveries would not need them, according to Harris-Burland. \n \nThey will not have the capacity to leave items on doorsteps, he said, because \u201ccustomers will get delivery within 30 minutes, when they are home\u201d and collect the goods at the door. \n \n\u2013 Mapping sidewalks \u2013 \n \nStarship has agreements for testing with the delivery firm Postmates in Washington and DoorDash in California, as it works toward a commercial model with other partners and retailers. \n \nWhen the pilot begins in February, consumers will be able to order pizza, toothpaste, milk or eggs through the services which may use humans or robots. \n \nStarship is not the only robotic delivery startup looking to disrupt the sector. \n \nCalifornia-based startup Dispatch has raised $2 million in venture funding to begin testing of its rolling robots. Another California firm, Savioke, has agreed to provide delivery bots to hotels and apartment complexes. \n \nStarship says one of its strong points is its \u201cvisual localization\u201d technology that allows for real-time mapping using nine cameras on each robot to help navigate along sidewalks and circumvent obstacles, people and pets. \n \n\u201cWe can see every crosswalk, every traffic light, every pothole,\u201d Harris-Burland said. \n \n\u201cA lot of companies have mapped roads but no one has mapped sidewalks.\u201d \n \nThe navigation is done by artificial intelligence, and the bots are \u201c99 percent autonomous,\u201d according to the spokesman. \n \n\u201cWe want a human being able to oversee the robot\u2019s journey and to intervene whenever there is a problem,\u201d he said. \n \nHarris-Burland said the company\u2019s tests so far in Europe have shown the system works, with no problems related to theft or vandalism. \n \nThe lids of the devices are locked until the customer opens it with a smartphone. If anyone tries to steal it, an alarm will sound, and if it is hijacked the company can track it \u201cto the nearest inch,\u201d he said. \n \n© 2017 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Robotics news","group":"Technology"}],"title":"New wave of robots set to deliver the goods","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Phoenix Sun.co.za","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"533464796","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Phoenix Sun.co.za","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://phoenixsun.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197718637","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Are they still planning to kill Dhlakama?\u201d asked the 64-year-old rebel, who often speaks about himself in the third person. \n\n\u201cAre they trying to find the river where Dhlakama is drinking from to poison it, or the roads we use to plant anti-personnel landmines?\u201d \n\nDhlakama, whose Renamo party is the main opposition in Mozambique, retreated in October 2012 to his hideout in Gorongosa with 800 former guerrillas demanding a greater share of power. \n\nIn 2013 tensions resurfaced with Renamo fighters again taking up arms against Frelimo, accusing the ruling party of enriching itself at the expense of the southern African country. \n\nOn the eve of the October 2014 general elections Renamo and the government signed a ceasefire. \n\nBut Renamo refused to accept the results of the 2014 elections when it was beaten once more at the polls by Frelimo, which has been in power since the former Portuguese colony\u2019s independence 40 years ago \n\n\u2013 \u2018Won\u2019t give up on truce\u2019 \u2013 \n\nDhlakama has accused the army of not only targeting Renamo members but civilians too. \n\n\u201cThe armed forces go to the villages, open fire to disperse the population, and then ransack the houses making off with chickens and goats, which is typical of Frelimo,\u201d he claimed, adding that women had been beaten and houses torched. \n\n\u201cEither Frelimo does not know how to control its troops or there is a clear lack of will,\u201d he said. \n\nAbuses have also been reported to international organisations by Mozambicans who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries. \n\nAuthorities in December said more than 3,000 people fleeing the conflict now live in government camps, while the UN refugee agency says another 8,600 have been forced to cross the border to Malawi and Zimbabwe. \n\nIn spite of the allegations, Dhlakama has no intention of calling off the ceasefire, which he admits he unilaterally proclaimed in a bid to reopen peace negotiations. \n\nThe peace talks with international mediators resumed in May last year but failed to prevent the escalation of tensions and by mid-December the mediators quit the country. \n\n\u201cI must speak to President Nyusi in the coming days because we are still waiting for him to give the signal for the return of mediators,\u201d said Dhlakama. \n\nThe rebel leader said he will leave his mountain base only to sign a peace agreement. \n\n\u201cWe are not going to give up on the truce. But every day someone calls me up to ask me to extend it beyond March 4.

Seven days later, norms and doctrine that have guided the United States for decades are being re-examined. \n\nTrump\u2019s down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address: a call to arms that tested old distinctions between left and right. \n\n\u201cToday, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cWe are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.\u201d \n\nThe establishment \u201celites\u201d in big cities, in politics and the media were no longer the technocrats in charge of the world\u2019s only superpower, they were the enemy. \n\nThe new president also put the rest of the world on notice. \n\nFor the last 75 years, America had been what Barack Obama described as the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d \u2014 the glue that bound the global order. \n\nThe era of Trump would be the era of \u201cAmerica first,\u201d he said, of naked self-interest and zero-sum diplomacy. Old alliances would be reassessed, new alliances would be explored. \n\nBefore his inauguration, many asked if the presidency would change Donald Trump, or whether Donald Trump would change the presidency. \n\nBarely 20 minutes into his four-year term, anyone who was listening had their answer. \n\n\u2013 Rolling thunder \u2013 \n\nBefore arriving at the Oval Office, Trump\u2019s strategists had decided to use the first few weeks to unleash a daily wave of executive orders. \n\nThe aim was to unbalance opponents, define Trump as a man of action and slake his supporters\u2019 thirst for change. \n\nFor much of middle America, globalization, automation and the Great Recession had been apocalyptic. \n\nPolitics had passed them over and worse, they felt steamrollered by \u201ccoastal elites\u201d in America\u2019s \u201cculture wars\u201d over abortion, gay rights, immigration, global warming and religion. \n\nTrump had won the election by promising to be their champion, and he was going to \u2014 as Ronald Reagan said \u2014 \u201cdance with the one that brung ya.\u201d \n\nFor the most part, the CEO-in-chief put forward actions that could have come from any Republican in the country: defunding abortion, preening the military and approving oil pipelines. \n\nBut it was coated with a thick veneer of nationalist and populist rhetoric, and accompanying policies championed by top aide Steve Bannon. \n\nTrump ripped up a trans-Pacific trade deal designed to counterbalance China\u2019s regional economic power, imposed a ban on refugees from Syria and migrants from seven other Muslim countries. \n\nHe ordered planning to begin to build a wall on Mexico\u2019s southern border and picked a very public fight with Mexico\u2019s president Enrique Pena Nieto, who cancelled a trip to Washington. \n\nThe United States, a nation founded by migrants, was now willing to shut its doors. \n\nNot since Obama\u2019s election or perhaps the Iraq War has America\u2019s image around the world changed so dramatically and so quickly. \n\nBut Trump supporters saw an outsider sticking up for them and sticking it to the elites. \n\n\u201cGet used to it,\u201d said Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, boasting that Trump had delivered a \u201cshock to the system.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s just getting started,\u201d she said. \n\n\u2013 Rocky start \u2013 \n\nBut it was not all positive for Trump. The White House is far from purring. Key positions have yet to be filled and the decision making process is haphazard. \n\nTrump aides were forced to publicly row back suggestions of a 20 percent border tax on Mexican goods and defend a chaotic rollout of the refugee and migrant ban. \n\nThroughout the week, Trump engaged in intemperate outbursts about the size of his inaugural crowd, alleged election fraud and perceived media persecution. \n\nPrivately, in call after call, he complained to top aides about press coverage. The impression was of a man focused on his image more than running the country. \n\nTrump also seemed like a a man for whom becoming US president was not adulation enough. \n\nSpokesman Sean Spicer \u2014 between tirades and missteps \u2014 offered a window onto the soul of the White House. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this constant theme to undercut the enormous support he has,\u201d Spicer said. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably frustrating when you\u2019re continually told it\u2019s not big enough; it\u2019s not good enough. You can\u2019t win.\u201d \n\nBut critics saw a more sinister motive for the outbursts, particularly Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that three million people voted illegally in the election. \n\nBrian Klaas, an expert on global democracy at the London School of Economics, sees Trump \u201ccasting aspersions (without evidence) on electoral integrity is a key way to restrict voting rights and erode confidence in elections.\u201d \n\n\u201cAttacking the media and blurring the lines of truth with state narratives not grounded in fact is important to sowing public doubt,\u201d he said. \n\nMindy Finn, who ran as a independent vice presidential candidate, summed up Trump\u2019s strategy as \u201csow chaos, deepen division and consolidate power.\u201d \n\nFor his harshest critics, the question is now whether Donald Trump breaks the presidency, or whether the presidency breaks Donald Trump. \n\n© 2017 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrew BEATTY"},"topics":[],"title":"In one week, Trump shakes up Washington and the world","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Phoenix Sun.co.za","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"533464796","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Phoenix Sun.co.za","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://phoenixsun.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197723110","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A team led by Georgia Tech Ph.D. candidate Tanushree Mitra scanned 66 million tweets linked to nearly 1,400 real-world events to build a language model that identified words and phrases that lead to strong or weak perceived levels of credibility on Twitter. \n \n\u201cThere have been many studies about social media credibility in recent years but very little is known about what types of words or phrases create credibility perceptions during rapidly unfolding events,\u201d Mitra said in a statement. The team looked at tweets surrounding events in 2014 and 2015, including the emergence of Ebola in West Africa, the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris and the death of Eric Garner in New York City. The team asked people to judge the posts on their credibility \u2014 from \u201ccertainly accurate\u201d to \u201ccertainly inaccurate\u201d \u2014 and then fed the words into a model that split them into 15 different linguistic categories. \n \nThe Georgia Tech computer then examined the words to judge if the tweets were credible or not. It matched the humans\u2019 opinions about 68 percent of the time. That\u2019s significantly higher than the random baseline of 25 percent, the research said. \u201cTweets with booster words, such as \u2018undeniable,\u2019 and positive emotion terms, such as \u2018eager\u2019 and \u2018terrific,\u2019 were viewed as highly credible,\u201d Mitra said. \u201cWords indicating positive sentiment but mocking the impracticality of the event, such as \u2018ha,\u2019 \u2018grins\u2019 or \u2018joking,\u2019 were seen as less credible. So were hedge words, including \u2018certain level\u2019 and \u2018suspects,\u2019\u201d she added. ALSO READ:  Facebook provides social support, Twitter helps users gain knowledge: Study \n \nHigher numbers of retweets also correlated with lower credibility scores. Replies and retweets with longer message lengths were thought to be more credible. \u201cIt could be that longer message lengths provide more information or reasoning, so they\u2019re viewed as more trustworthy,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, a higher number of retweets, which was scored lower on credibility, might represent an attempt to elicit collective reasoning during times of crisis or uncertainty,\u201d she added. The system, when deployed, could eventually become an app that displays the perceived trustworthiness of an event as it unfolds on social media.  ALSO READ:  Fake Twitter account networks with over 350,000 profiles uncovered \n BONUS VIDEO: Twitter Top Moments in India in 2016 \n \n \nSource link \n \nThe post appeared first on JOLLYBOSS .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Researchers develop system to analyze credibility of tweets","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"JOLLYBOSS","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"582875783","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"JOLLYBOSS","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jollyboss.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.bgr.in/news/facebook-provides-social-support-twitter-helps-users-gain-knowledge-study/","http://www.bgr.in/news/fake-twitter-account-networks-with-over-350000-profiles-uncovered/","http://www.bgr.in/news/researchers-develop-system-to-analyze-credibility-of-tweets/"],"sequenceId":"695197723365","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:30Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://i0.wp.com/www.jollyboss.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/twitter-logo.jpg?w=640"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n Lawsuit is first challenge to executive order  \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n Released under special circumstances  \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n 'The executive order is unlawful'  \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n Legality questioned  \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US.

If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 14 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Milwaukee","zipCode":"53201","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Milwaukee","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WISN Milwaukee","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169659888","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"504"},"name":"WISN Milwaukee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wisn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197736599","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A number of things have changed the way one looks at cosmetic surgery and how it is performed. Gone are those days where one was looking for over augmented looks to steal the show. Through 2016, it was all about getting the natural look. It will stay around for a while and will continue to be patients first request during 2017. \n \nA bigger change coming our way is the increase in demand to perform major surgeries using techniques that are minimal invasive, meaning lower downtime and are driven by advanced technology. A good surgeon would have already invested in these technologies, to stay ahead in the game. There are a number of surgeries that can be performed minimal invasively, ranging from facelifts, to breast augmentation to liposuction in various parts of the body. \n \nBotox and Fillers, will continue to rule the cosmetic industry. The need to look young, wrinkle-free and beautiful will never die. Injectables will be in high demand and are expected to take a new leap further. For minor fat pockets, injectable based fat dissolving is also gaining popularity, especially around the face and neck. \n \nCombination injectables based contouring \u2013 aimed at achieving a desired change in the face is not new, but is getting popular now and will boom in 2017. Procedures designed on beauty icons like \u2013 Cleopatra, Nefertiti, Adonis, etc. are based on combination injectables and endless experience. These procedures are designed to give symmetrical proportions, define a desired contour, address sagging skin, take care of facial fat loss and even remove hollows. These procedures also rejuvenate the skin and obviously gives a younger, energetic and pleasing look. \n \nLiposculpting, which was popular through 2015/2016, is also making new leaps ahead. It was restricted to the body and used to define or contour, the abs, ab-crack, waistline, arms, biceps definition, legs, chest, calves etc. It was still not performed at a Microlevel, but it will be now. I recently presented a new concept at one of the leading international conference \u2013 called Microliposcutpting. The concept takes liposuction two prongs ahead \u2013 now one can perform liposuction on the face with no marks and also go a level ahead while contouring small pockets of fat on the body with precision. It is extremely beneficial for people who spend a lot of time in the gym trying to get the fat-free-muscle-defined look. Microliposuclpting will gain practice in 2017. Definitely in my Clinic. \n \nFor the overweight and obese, 360 degrees slim-sculpting will gain popularity. It is not about getting the perfect lean, gym goers look. It\u2019s about looking great in the clothes they wish to wear. It is achieved by addressing the right fat pockets and strategically combining multiple procedures. It\u2019s also termed as the Instant Slim look or a SlimFit procedure. A perfect confidence booster. \n \n2016, also saw significant improvement in using the body\u2019s own cells to address cosmetic and non-cosmetic issues. It has been identified scientifically, that body\u2019s own cells are a good resource for many problems not only in the beauty industry but in people with sports injuries and joint problems. Platelet enriched plasma, autologous fillers, adipose derived stem cells or growth factors are some of the new technologies to look for\u2026. We may even call them Organic cosmetic solutions. \n \nEditorial contributed by Dr Sanjay Parashar \u2013 International Plastic Surgeon for Cocoona Centre for Aesthetic Transformation . \n[yasr_overall_rating size=\"medium\"]","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Cosmetic Industry Trends for 2017","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Beauty Hub","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"228473345","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"205"},"name":"The Beauty Hub","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle","Fashion"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thebeautyhub.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197738118","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:30:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.thebeautyhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cosmetic-Industry-Trends-250x159.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

She was my biggest ally. She gave everything, she gave a tremendous, very complex performance,\u201d Villeneuve, 49, told AFP at the Producers Guild Awards (PGAs) in Beverly Hills. \n \nTaking its cue from classics such as \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d (1977) and \u201cContact\u201d (1997), \u201cArrival\u201d was filmed in Villeneuve\u2019s native Quebec for a relatively small $50 million. \n \nAdams, 42, was universally lauded for her portrayal of Louise Banks, a linguist enlisted by the army after alien pods pop up worldwide, to help figure out what their occupants want. \n   Actress Amy Adams and director Denis Villeneuve attend Adams\u2019 star ceremony on the Hollywood Walk of Fame | © Getty/AFP/File | Alberto E.

Negotiating the FY 2017 Budget Bill was an extensive process, getting the governor plus the senate and the house to all agree on the figures that we thought was appropriate. \n \nWe plan to vote on this bill next Monday, Jan. 30. \n \nWe hope this will pass so we can move on to other priorities that we have this session.

There are several bills that I feel are very important to the people I represent in District 5. \n \nNumber one is House File 1 (HF 1) which is a process to review all state programs on a minimum rotation every five years.

Another bill presented will protect our students from sexual exploitation by school employees which is an extremely important issue. \n \nWe will watch this issue as they proceed through the voting process. \n \nMoving forward for FY18 the house, senate, and governor have agreed to a maximum level of spending totaling $7.455 billion. This agreement is within ongoing revenue and is $25 million below the 99 percent expenditure limitation. If the March revenue estimate is lowered, then that maximum spending level will be lowered. House Republicans have not agreed to spend $7.455 billion only that this number is the ceiling. A total spending level below that amount could still be approved. \n \nWith revenue projections being very unpredictable over the last several budget years, a conservative approach to the budget is necessary. Current law allows the Legislature to spend 99 percent of available revenue; however, House Republicans will look to spend less than the allowed ceiling in the event that revenue projections are inaccurate again. \n \nOn Saturday, Jan. 28, I will be attending and participating with Senator Bill Anderson in several forums in the following towns and locations: \n \n\u2022 9\u20139:45 a.m. \u2014 Moville Forum, Fire Station, 24 W. Main St., Moville. \n \n\u2022 10-10:45 a.m. \u2014 Pierson Forum, City Hall, 201 Main St., Pierson. \n \n\u2022 11:15 a.m. to noon \u2014 Kingsley Forum, Community Building, 207 East First St., Kingsley. \n \n\u2022 12:45\u20131:30 p.m. \u2014 Remsen Forum, Three Sisters Bistro, 203 Washington St., Remsen. \n \nI hope to see you at one of the forums.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Computer security news","group":"Technology"}],"title":"Legislative update with Holz DES MOINES \u2014 As we end the third week in our legislative session, I do have good news.

The Raiders closed within 9-7 with 9 minutes, 39 seconds remaining in the game on Timmy Platte\u2019s goal that deflected off an Easton defender. Another shot by Platte seconds later hit the crossbar as the Raiders applied pressure on Easton goalie Cory Shorter. But Callahan broke free with the puck on the right wing and beat Raiders goalie Ryan Conover high to the left side of the net with 7:11 remaining to break the Raiders\u2019 momentum and end the game\u2019s scoring. \n   \nEaston claimed its second straight victory to improve to 2-6-1. Eleanor Roosevelt fell to 1-9. \n   \nPlatte, Kenan Waters, and Evan Labonte each scored a pair of goals for the Raiders. \n   \nCallahan collected a loose puck at mid-ice and scored on a breakaway, past Raiders starting goalie Noah Haycock, to open the game\u2019s scoring with 11:37 left in the first period. But Roosevelt countered with four unanswered goals for a 4-1 lead with 2:28 left in the period. Haycock kept the puck out of the net, thwarting multiple breakaway opportunities, until Callahan beat him with 1:20 remaining to pull Easton within 4-2 at the end of the period. \n   \nPeriod 2 was all Easton, including a lot of Callahan. \n   \n\u201cFrustrated,\u201d said Callahan about the early going and then \u201cwhen I scored that second goal it was all on from there, just steady scoring. ... It was our second win, so it felt awesome.\u201d \n   \nTwenty-five seconds into the second period, Bryan Roney circled behind the net and fed Callahan for a goal to make it 4-3. Thirty seconds later Wyatt Gosnell wristed a shot inside the far post to tie it. Callahan stopped and popped from the right wing, at the top of the circle, to make it 5-4 with 12:35 left in the second period, and Easton led the rest of the game. \n   \nCallahan broke free again 39 seconds later, sticked the puck down the left wing, and scored high past Haycock to make it 6-4. He did it again with 10:11 remaining in the second to make it 7-4, ending Haycock\u2019s afternoon in net. \n   \nPlay then got more physical with interference and slashing penalties called on the Raiders. Brady Barnes took advantage, scoring a shorthanded goal for Easton with 3:15 left in the second period to make it 8-4. Evan Labonte answered just nine seconds later for the Raiders to make it 8-5. \n   \nEaston then got whistled for two slashing penalties (the second one negating a goal from the blue line by Callahan) and the Warriors were two men down with 2:04 left. But it didn\u2019t bother Callahan. He knocked the puck free again and raced down ice before beating Conover high inside the far post for a 9-5 lead at the end of the second period. \n   \nShorter relieved Conner Roney and tended the net in the second and third periods. \n   \n\u201cWe won because we played smart hockey the majority of the game,\u201d Easton head coach Tucker Roney said. \u201cWe won because we gutted it out. It was a long hard-fought game with a lot of scoring, and we just came out on top. Clark showed up to play and I\u2019m glad he did. He\u2019s a natural skater, just a great talent with puck handling and shooting. He\u2019s really something when he plays his game and he played his game tonight.\u201d \n   \nThe Warriors host Severna Park in their final game of the season on Friday, Feb. 3.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CHRIS KNAUSS cknauss@stardem.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Callahan nets 8 goals, Warriors top Raiders","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Talbot","zipCode":"21601","state":"Maryland","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Easton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Easton Star-Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665883","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"16"},"name":"Easton Star-Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stardem.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197751185","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T01:31:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Almost one year to the day in 2002, the Ravens scored 125 points against Angelina but that production came in an overtime contest.\n\nSan Jac, now 4-0 in South Zone play and 11-0 overall in conference, had to keep piling on the points because Coastal Bend was sharp from the perimeter. It was only a 56-47 Ravens lead at the break, before San Jac surpassed that with a 68-point second-half eruption.\n\n\"It looked like we didn't know anything coming into the game. I know they made eight (3s) in the first half and I bet they ended up with 20 for the game. (Willie) Rooks is a good player. He's leading the conference in scoring. We might have held him below his conference average (26 points), but he was close to that. But we've got some firepower too,\" Ravens head coach Scott R. Gernander said.\n\nYeah, that's for sure. Let's start with Jorden Duffy's own 26 points, followed by Kabir Mohammad's 20, James Kirksey's 18, Tay Hardy's 17, Konstantin Kulikov's 13 and Elton Dyer's 12.\n\nAdd it all up and it was a fun night to be at Anders, watching the No. 4 team in the nation light up the scoreboard.\n\nThere was a moment late in the game that defined that fun. Over three consecutive possessions, Hardy hit 3-point goals, energizing the nice crowd with each long-distance goal. His first one showed off his hustle when he corraled a ball, but appeared stuck in the left corner. Not so. He made this slight turn with his body, launched his legs off the floor and watched the ball find nothing but net. In fact, all three were swishes.\n\nBut adding to the crowd's fun was the fact that Coastal Bend's Taywyn Mason, Jr. was matching Hardy bonus goal for bonus goal until Mason misfired on his third consecutive attempt.\n\nAfter a road trip to Lamar State College-Port Arthur on Wednesday, the Ravens will be home again next Saturday, opposing the Roadrunners from Angelina College.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country.

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\"\n\nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour.\n\n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n\n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\"\n\nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court.\n\n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\"\n\n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty) X","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Simon Cambers"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Reuters UK","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587711","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"266"},"name":"Reuters UK","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://uk.reuters.com/","publisher":"Thomson Reuters"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&taboola_utm_source=cox-clarkhoward&taboola_utm_medium=bytaboola&taboola_utm_content=thumbnails-b:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20SC"],"sequenceId":"695197755847","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170129&t=2&i=1170578314&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED0S06F"}],"video":[]}}

(SOURCE: Tombstone Epitaph) \n  \nStill, the corral ( ok-corral.com ), remains and is open to visitors, with life-size cutouts placed in the approximate spots as detailed in a map drawn by Earp depicts. Daily re-enactments depict the drama as it unfolds. \n  \n \nContinue reading \n    \nAnd the neighboring Historama, through the voice of Vincent Price, tells the Tombstone tale from the town\u2019s founding in connection with a major silver strike, through the various gunfights, a fire that nearly leveled the town and the assassination of Morgan Earp. Geronimo and his Chiricahua band of Apaches frequented the nearby mountains. \n \nA replica of a gallows stands in the courtyard of the Tombstone Courthouse State Historic Park, where seven men were hanged. (SOURCE: Tombstone Courthouse State Historic Park) \n  \nAlthough it was the shootout that gave Tombstone its everlasting fame or infamy, it was the lure of silver that first attracted the miners, then the bandits and desperadoes to the town. \n \nA great way to see how it all started is a trip deep into the Good Enough Mine ( goodenoughmine.com ). \n \nThe oldest of the historic sites in Tombstone, the mine is the original one where Ed Schieffelin discovered silver in the late 1870s. There are two tours, one of which lasts about 45 minutes and takes visitors down 58 steep steps into a big room where the first big vein was discovered, mine owner Shirley Dejournett said. \n \nThe original silver mine that gave birth to Tombstone is open for tours. (SOURCE: Good Enough Mine) \n  \nA longer tour, which requires reservations, lasts about 2½ hours and drops more than 500 feet, approaching the water table, she said. \n \nIt\u2019s a much more compelling, extreme trip, covering about a half-mile, with carved rooms 750 long with ceilings 40 feet tall and 40 feet wide, Dejournett said. \n \n\u201cThis is a physically challenging tour,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the history and the geology you\u2019ll see are more than worth the effort.\u201d \n \nAlthough the town has a deservedly rough-and-tumble reputation, there\u2019s an artistic side to it as well, which can be seen in the Rose Tree Museum ( tombstonerosetree.com ). \n  \n \nContinue reading \n    \nThe museum is home to what\u2019s called the world\u2019s largest rose tree, a Scottish white Lady Banksia rose planted in 1885. In 1937, Robert Ripley wrote about it in his syndicated column,\u201dBelieve It or Not.\u201d \n \nThe world\u2019s largest rose tree, covering more than 5,000 square feet, was planted in Tombstone in 1885. (SOURCE: Rose Tree Museum) \n  \nThe tree now covers about 5,000 square feet and its perfume can be smelled several blocks away. \n \nThe Tombstone Courthouse State Historic Park, built in 1882 in the shape of a Roman cross, is a 12,000-square-foot museum that tells the history of the area and includes such interesting memorabilia as a tax license for operating a brothel and an invitation to a hanging. \n \nThe courtyard includes a replica of a gallows where five men were hung in 1884 for killing four people during a robbery in nearby Bisbee. \n \nThe five, as well as those killed in the shootout, are among the many notorious people buried on the outskirts of town in Boot Hill Cemetery, which also is open to the public. \n \nAnd with a name like Tombstone, it\u2019s fitting that the town\u2019s newspaper is called the Epitaph, started by its first mayor, John Clum.

That experiment in Bihar had succeeded and there was a view among common people that there could be a coalition of like-minded secular people or people who are close to being secular or those who were once secular but because of political compulsions lost their way and again want to take that path, so those people should come together and contest elections,\" Khan told PTI. \n\nHe was asked about the Samajwadi Partys decision to contest the UP Assembly polls in coalition with Congress, a party which he has often criticised in the past and has accused of making false promises to the Muslim community. \n\nKhan, who is the most prominent Muslim face of the SP, said the Muslim community has a long history of association with the Congress from the days of the freedom struggle and people including Maulana Azad, M A Jinnah and Allama Iqbal have been Presidents or prominent leaders of the party. \n\nThe Congress was even the champion of the freedom struggle and even 50 years after Independence, the Muslims stayed with Congress despite the fact that there some were big incidents, Khan said. \n\nHowever, the Babri Masjid incident, the shilanyas episode etc. did hurt and led to introspection as to whether the community had made a mistake by not going to Pakistan in 1947, he added. \n\n\"We are not giving (Congress) a clean chit. We are choosing the lesser evil,\" Khan said. \n\nAsked to elaborate on his comment, the SP leader said  it is lesser evil in a way that while he does not know what compulsions Congress may have had, but the \"very agenda of BJP and RSS is against the weak, Dalits, backward and minorities.\" \n\nKhan, however, added that this is not a time to discuss these issues and these questions could be answered better after the elections. \n\nAsked about his opinion on various corruption charges levelled against the Congress, Khan said demonetisation is in itself a much bigger \"scandal\" than anything that may have happened during a Congress regime. \n\nOn whether the Congress-SP tie up would be extended to 2019 Lok Sabha elections as well, Khan said it cant be said now but added that the the tie up in \"2017 would yield benefits in 2019 as well.\" \n\nAsked about the BSPs bid to woo the Muslim community, as the party has given 97 tickets to candidates belonging to the community, Khan said that if the party really wanted to please Muslims it should have given them 403 seats. \n\n\"This is less, they should have given them 403 seats, if they really wanted to please the Muslims. Muslims have brought their (BSP) government in the state four times. We deserve this much,\" he said. \n\nAsked to comment on the differences between SP leader Mulayam Singh and his son UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, Khan said that he had all along tried to be a bridge and tried to ensure that SP comes to power in the state. \n\nKhan also also referred to remarks made by RSS leader Manmohan Vaidya in Jaipur, saying that despite the \"heavy loss\" in Bihar, RSS leaders keep making remarks against reservation as it is an attempt to test the mood of the people. \n\n\"They are waiting for the day when they would say that there should be no reservation and the reaction is mild or not there. Then they would withdraw it,\" Khan alleged.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"SP opted for 'lesser evil' Congress in UP: Azam Khan","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Deccan Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658157","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"67"},"name":"Deccan Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197768168","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T01:35:26Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

These are priced between Rs 8.78 lakh and Rs 10.63 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). \n\nWhen contacted a MSI spokesperson told PTI: \"In this segment (1.6 litre engine), customers go for highest trim that has all the features. Therefore, it is business prudence to keep the number of variants at an optimum level in line with customers requirements.\" \n\nThe models performance is in line with the companys expectation, the spokesperson added. \n\n\"We started a new segment called premium crossover with S Cross. Volume-wise, S-Cross continues to do an average of 2,000-2,100 units monthly,\" the spokesperson said. \n\nS-Cross, the first model from the stable of MSI to be sold through its premium retail chain NEXA, has had a chequered history. \n\nMSI had introduced the S-Cross in two options of 1.6 litre and 1.3 litre engines in 2015 coinciding with the launch of its premium retail outlet chain Nexa. However, pricing issues hindered sales of the vehicle forcing the company to go for price correction. \n\nLast year, the company had cut price of the vehicle by over Rs 2 lakh. The reduction in the price of 1.6 litre variant was Rs 2,05,000 for all the three trims, while that of 1.3 litre variant ranged from Rs 40,000 to Rs 66,000. \n\nS-Cross along with Vitara Brezza have helped the company enhance its market share in the utility vehicle (UV) segment. \n\nWhile Vitara Brezza has been a runaway hit, S-Cross has been a slow starter for the company. \n\nAcknowledging the fact, the spokesperson said: \"Every brand has a specific role in the overall portfolio. While some are mass models that sell in big numbers, others may not sell as much as a mass model but contribute to the overall brand objectives of the company for the medium and long term\". \n\nS-Cross helps Maruti Suzuki in expanding its range and presence with an eye on the future, the spokesperson added. \n\nGrowth in the UV segment for MSI is over 120 per cent for the April-December period this fiscal. Volume wise the company has sold 1,43,254 units during the April-December period as compared to 63,924 units in the previous fiscal. \n\nThe company now commands over 65 per cent market share in the total UV segment.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Maruti discontinues sale of lower variants of S-Cross","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Deccan Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658157","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"67"},"name":"Deccan Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197768349","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T01:44:10Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Not only did the rail-thin Patel bulk up to play the sporty Bierley, grow his hair out and learn a difficult Australian accent, but he also fully immersed himself into the emotional and spiritual reality of the man.\n\n\u201cI traveled the trains in India. I wrote a diary. I went to orphanages. I\u2019d watched every piece of material about (Brierley) out there on Google and YouTube. When I met him I felt like, \u2018God I\u2019ve known you for eight, nine, months already,\u2019\u2009\u201d Patel said. Brierley and Patel had to go much deeper than that, though. This is not a simple boy goes home story. Brierley\u2019s traumatic separation from his home and his mother and struggle to survive on his own is contrasted by his then comfortable upbringing in Australia with supportive and loving adoptive parents. His past is something that he represses for years, until it becomes a ghost so undeniable that he must do everything he can to find his mother.\n\n\u201cWe sat down and spoke about this idea of guilt. He spoke about astral traveling with me. We got very meta in a way,\u201d Patel said. \u201cHe could remember these things so vividly because every single night he would walk those streets home to his mother. That\u2019s how he could remember it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of those stranger-than-fiction stories that begs for cinematic treatment.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that the majority or even half the movie is sensationalized. It really isn\u2019t. It actually happened in real life,\u201d Brierley said.\n\nOn set, director Garth Davis pushed Patel deeper into Brierley\u2019s pain. He had Patel watch the actor playing the 5-year-old Brierley (Sunny Pawar) so that there were specific memories to draw on. He threw him into big scenes right off the bat (they shot the very last scene first), and he made him do \u201chippie\u201d mental exercises like staring into a mirror for a half hour before coming to set one day.\n\n\u201cThe first two minutes were excruciating, because when you do that, you\u2019re usually brushing your teeth or popping a pimple or something and then the next 20 minutes all of a sudden I got sucked into this sort of trance-like state and I couldn\u2019t recognize the person staring back at me,\u201d Patel said. \u201cI looked like my father, I looked like my mother. And I went to set visibly shaken. I was like \u2018Garth, I feel like a fool, like I don\u2019t know who I am. I think that the task went horribly wrong.\u2019 He looked at me and said, \u2018that\u2019s exactly what you should feel. Your body is just a shell but your soul is ever-changing. I was like \u2018whoa.\u2019\u2009\u201d Patel is already fully on the awards trail for \u201cLion.\u201d He\u2019s done this before, but now has experience under his belt and is no longer that wide-eyed 18-year-old.\n\n\u201cThe first time around I was so beautifully naive about it. I look at Sunny and I can relate to it. He met Bill Clinton the other day and I don\u2019t quite think it dawned on him who the man was he was meeting,\u201d Patel said, laughing.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: movie news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Patel ferocious in pursuit of 'Lion' role","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Marion","zipCode":"46204","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indianapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Journal-Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657677","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1517"},"name":"Journal-Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Film","Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.journalgazette.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197771056","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://journalgazette.net/assets/13597802/17266694.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It's not easy for sure. Need a little luck there, too, when it goes post and in sometimes.\" \n \nThe other parts of the relay included one-timers, puck control, stick-handling and goalie goals. \n \nAlthough Nielsen did his part and Montreal goaltender Carey Price needed just one shot to score, Crosby got the Metropolitan Division the win with a quick finish in stick-handling. \n \nNielsen did not participate in the NHL Four Line Challenge, won by the Pacific Division when Arizona goaltender Mike Smith got 20 points by scoring a goal from the opposite end of the ice. \n \nIn the NHL Accuracy Shooting, Nielsen helped pass to former New York Islanders teammate Kyle Okposo as Okposo went up against current Islander John Tavares. \n \nOkposo hit all four targets in 15.97 seconds to Tavares' 26.80. \n \n\"It's skills competition so I'm just trying to hit the targets,\" Tavares said. \"It's not like you're battling in a game or the corner and you're getting a little bit more physical and playing hard on him. Hat's off to him, he did a good job and for me it wasn't as efficient as it was last year but it was fun.\" \n \nTavares won the accuracy shooting competition last year but this year Crosby took top honors. \n \n\"I think I would like to try the accurate shooting with the targets,\" Nielsen said. \"I think it's one of those big ones every year, that and the hardest shot, those are two that you remember. It would have have been fun to try that.\" \n \nEdmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid easily won the NHL Fastest Skater competition, beating Vancouver's Bo Horvat. \n \nMcDavid then had a chance to try to beat Dylan Larkin 's one-lap record of 13.172 but came up short, going 13.310. \n \nNo one was surprised that Canadiens defenseman Shea Weber won the hardest shot competition with a 102.8 mile-an-hour blast. \n \nWinnipeg Jets rookie Patrik Laine was impressive with shots at 101.7 and 101.5 miles per hour. \n \nNielsen and Tavares both say they will let Weber and Laine have that competition to themselves. \n \n\"I'm going to stay out of that one,\" Nielsen said. \n \nSaid Tavares: \"I'm glad I didn't participate in the fastest skater or hardest shot, that's for sure. Those aren't easy, especially when you're cold and sitting around and not much warm-up and we had a travel day yesterday. They're all pretty challenging. I know a couple years ago I did the passing and didn't do that well in it so it was nice to be a little bit better this year. I did really well on the targets last year, didn't go as well this year. They're all challenging in their own way, they're all a lot of fun. That's what it's meant to be is to enjoy and celebrate all the skill and talent that's here and why our game's so great.\" \n \nBecause Weber won the hardest shot competition, that broke the tie with the Metropolitan Division and the Atlantic Division team competed in the shootout against the Pacific Division. \n \nDespite being one of the best shootout performers in league history, Nielsen could not beat Smith. \n \n\"You're sitting out there, didn't feel really good skating down there after sitting on the ice for half an hour,\" Nielsen said. \"I just tried to keep it simple and hope to catch him five-hole. It was all fun.\" \n \nBoston's Brad Marchand, Weber and Crosby (with the two-point Discover puck) scored for the Atlantic Division and only Ryker Kesler, Ryan Kesler's 6-year-old son, could solve Price, who may not have given his best effort. \n \nThat meant the Atlantic Division won, earning the right to decide which team they would play and which game. Price, the captain, announced they would play the Metropolitan Division in the second game. \n \n\"Just want to beat those guys, I guess,\" Nielsen said. \"I wasn't really in the decision making but I just heard some guys played the first game last year and it was tough to sit for so long before you had to go out and play again. So that's why they went second, just want to keep playing if they win.\" \n \nIt was certainly a win for Nielsen in the first day of his first All-Star experience. \n \n\"I don't know if there's one specific thing, for sure the thing I was a part of out there,\" Nielsen said. \"But just the whole experience, everything. It was awesome. It was just great, all these great players.

How cool would it be to have the center court, and then install it onto his living room floor? \n \nKeys has done just that, paying homage to what were some of the greatest times of his life: playing basketball in the gym at Newport Harbor. In the process, he has become the envy of Newport Harbor alumni. \n\nIn Keys' defense, all he did was have the idea and asked. He asked Newport Harbor Principal Sean Boulton for pieces of the gym. Keys also went the extra mile and brought lunch for the workers who were renovating the gym floor. \n \n\"He's the only one who asked for it,\" said Boulton, who had the gym's two pieces that read, \"Yardley Court,\" given to the Yardley family. \"Mark just said, 'I want to take center court.'

Soon he attended Ensign and would sometimes play at the gym to get ready for the days when he would play for the high school team. \n\nHe loved the history of Ralph Reed gym, and the floor named after Hall of Famer George Yardley. \n\nAs a teenager, Keys said he would sneak into the gym late at night to play hoops with all his friends: Warren Doody, Joe McCarthy, Kevin Doody, Pat McCarthy, Pat Baker, Fraser Keys, Chris Keys, Dave Altman and Dan Stekol, among many others. \n\nSometimes they would even have guys from Corona del Mar High to come and play, too, Keys said. \n\n\"We didn't have any cell phones,\" said Keys, 58, who lives with his family in Costa Mesa near the Back Bay. \"We had to get guys to come out based on just one phone call. Sometimes we played one on one or just shot around \u2026 When I heard they were taking out the floor at the gym, I knew I had to get it.\" \n\nThe old Newport Harbor gym floor has many memories and great moments. Some of the all-time great volleyball players like Misty May-Treanor, April Ross and Steve Timmons played there. \n\nThe old floor is in a good home, and just seems to fit in perfectly with the rest of Keys' memorabilia, which includes two seats from the old Pauley Pavilion at UCLA. \n\nKeys has more old Newport Harbor gym floor pieces aside from the piece of center court in his living room. He's been giving those pieces to friends. \n\nKeys remains a loyal fan of the Sailors, all their sports teams, especially boys' basketball, which is 14-9, 3-3 in the Sunset League and fresh off a 61-45 win over Marina on Thursday night. \n\nIt's a big week for the Sailors as they will play at Los Alamitos Wednesday and at Edison Friday. \n\nKeys does his best to attend the games, but it is challenging for a man living with disabilities. He has suffered from back and leg problems stemming from injuries as a boat rigger on Balboa Island in 1991. He has had 37 surgeries since then. \n\nBut Keys maintains a great outlook on life with hobbies that include his memorabilia. He also puts great effort into his, \"My Best Day,\" books, which include Pro Football and USC athletics themes. He was featured on ESPN in 2014. \n\nThe books feature athletes who provide the best day of their life. \n\nKeys plans to compile a My Best Day book on Newport Harbor athletics. Keys has had many great days, including the day he put the piece of center court of the old Newport Harbor gym floor into his home.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Virgen's View: A special piece of Newport Harbor","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Los Angeles Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587902","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"22602"},"name":"Los Angeles Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.latimes.com","publisher":"Tribune Company"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197773359","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They sort of have to because of his size. Harvey is 6-foot-8. \n\nEarlier this week at school, there was a rare sight, as someone else dwarfed Harvey. Mamadou Ndiaye, who's 7-6, crossed paths with Harvey. They gave each other a fist bump before Ndiaye ducked under the doorway into Ocean View's gym. \n \n\"I've met him before at a UC Irvine game,\" Harvey said of Ndiaye, who played for the Anteaters for three seasons before he declared in April for the NBA Draft. \"I doubt that he remembers me.\" \n\nWhile Ndiaye might not know who Harvey is, Harvey is making a name for himself in his junior season at Ocean View. Just as Ndiaye came on to the scene in Huntington Beach as a junior five seasons ago, when he played for Brethren Christian, Harvey is the city's next big man controlling the paint. \n \nHarvey is not scoring as Ndiaye did, but he is rebounding and blocking shots at the same rate as the Senegal native. Harvey is averaging 14.5 points, 10.3 rebounds and 5.1 blocks per game. The rebounds rank second in Orange County and the blocks No. 1. \n\nTwice this season Harvey has finished with a triple-double, doing it the hard way by swatting 10 or more shots. Harvey is performing at a high level, and what is remarkable is the 200-pound center has bounced back from a left patella tendon injury that knocked him out last season. \n\nThis week marked an important one for Harvey. Around this time a year ago, his sophomore season ended. Four games into Golden West League play, Harvey went down. \n\n\"My patella ripped off the bone. My knee flexed too hard, and the bone was weakened from previous injuries,\" Harvey said. \"I was just grabbing a [defensive] rebound. I feel it pop and I fell back. I couldn't get up. \n\n\"I just thought that my kneecap dislocated, until I got to the hospital and they took X-rays. I thought I was going to be back in time for [the] CIF [Southern Section Division 3A playoffs]. When [the doctor] started talking to me about surgery plans that same night, at that point, I'm just thinking about next year.\" \n\nSeven months are how many Harvey said it took him to start playing again on the court. At the end of August, he said he took part in a three-on-three pick-up game at Ocean View with one of his coaches, Roger Holmes, and a few other guys. \n\n\"I was a little nervous,\" Harvey said, \"but once I started to get going, I just couldn't wait to play five-on-five. I waited a couple of weeks before I did that.\" \n\nThree months after playing for the first time since his surgery, in his third game with the Seahawks, Harvey produced a triple-double. And he didn't even know it. \n\nHis friend and teammate, Kamani Slusher, told him that he pulled it off. Harvey finished with 12 points, 21 rebounds and 10 blocks in Ocean View's 62-30 win against Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies in a pool-play game during the school's Jim Harris Memorial Tournament of Champions on Nov. 29. \n\n\"We saw each other in class and [Slusher] let me know, saying, 'Man! You got a triple-double! How are you feeling?'\" said Harvey, adding that he was feeling pretty good. \"Then I hear it in the announcements [at school], in third period. They were like reading off the stat lines, and they said, 'Mehkel Harvey with a triple-double.' [My classmates] were just like, 'Mehkel, that's crazy!'\" \n\nSeventeen days later, in a 68-50 pool-play win over Western at the Loatella Tournament at Loara High, Harvey got his second triple-double, 18 points, 11 rebounds and 12 blocks. There would be no announcement at school because there was no school the next day, the contest was on a Friday. \n\nThis Friday, Harvey came close to another triple-double. He had 17 points, 16 rebounds and seven blocks, helping the Seahawks win at Loara, 72-62, to improve to 6-0 in league. \n\nOcean View has won its last 21 games in league, and it should claim its third straight title, second going undefeated. The crown Harvey and the Seahawks, who are 17-6 overall and ranked No. 12 in the CIF Southern Section Division 3AA poll, want to make a run at is the one they fell short of reaching last season. \n\nWithout Harvey, Ocean View made the quarterfinals, losing at home to top-seeded Rancho Mirage, 90-62. Many didn't expect the Seahawks to advance that far, but they went into Servite in the second round and won, 56-53. \n\nThat victory stands out to Harvey as his favorite athletic moment, and to Coach Tim Walsh that says a lot about Harvey. \n\n\"He didn't even play in that game. That's the kind of kid he is, a really good kid,\" Walsh said of the soft-spoken Harvey, who turned 16 in August. \"He has no idea how good he could be. He's not even close to his potential. He has to keep growing. He's kind of grown into his body a little bit. His offensive improvement is going to continue.\" \n\nMehkel Harvey \n\nBorn: Aug. 1, 2000 \n\nHometown: Huntington Beach \n\nHeight: 6-foot-8 \n\nWeight: 200 pounds \n\nSport: Basketball \n\nYear: Junior \n\nCoaches: Tim Walsh, Roger Holmes \n\nFavorite food: Pasta \n\nFavorite movie: \"Inception\" \n\nFavorite athletic moment: \"Beating Servite last year in [the second round of the] CIF [Southern Section Division 3A playoffs].\" \n\nWeek in review: Harvey led the Seahawks to three wins last week, averaging 13.3 points, 10.3 rebounds, 4.6 blocks and two steals per game.　　　　　　","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Daily Pilot High School Male Athlete of the Week: Ocean...","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Los Angeles Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587902","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"22602"},"name":"Los Angeles Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.latimes.com","publisher":"Tribune Company"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197775282","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

No matter the weather, thousands of abortion opponents gather every year on the National Mall, many wearing matching hats or scarves from their school or church groups, and listen to speeches from social conservatives in Congress before marching to the Supreme Court. \n  \nPence speaks at the rally (Photo: Reuters) \n  \nThis year, though, the anti-abortion movement has political momentum on its side, and Vice President Mike Pence lent his newly minted star power to Friday's rally, promising the triumphant crowd that more victories await. \n\n \n\"We've come to a historic moment in the cause for life,\" said Pence. \"Life is winning in America.\" \n  \nThe March for Life in Washington (Photo: AFP) \n  \nHe said the Trump administration would \"work with the Congress to end taxpayer funding of abortion and abortion providers, and we will devote those resources to health care services for women across America.\" \n \nA budget provision known as the Hyde Amendment already bans federal funding for Medicaid coverage of most abortions. Conservatives would like to see the rule made into a permanent law. \n  \nPhoto: Reuters \n  \nPence added that the nation's founders, in the Declaration of Independence, intended \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" to be for all Americans, including the unborn. \n \nHe accused the US Supreme Court, in its landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 that legalized abortion, of having \"turned away from these timeless ideals.\" \n \nHe said President Donald Trump would be nominating a Supreme Court justice next week who \"will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution.\" \n \nPresident Donald Trump used his Twitter account to express support for abortion opponents attending the March for Life in Washington. \n \n\"The #MarchForLife is so important. To all of you marching --- you have my full support!\" Trump said in a tweet. \n \nThe March for Life is usually held on the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court decision\u2014Jan. 22\u2014but it was pushed back this year because of Trump's inauguration. \n \nMajority Republicans in the House and Senate would also like to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which provided more than a third of the nation's abortions in 2014. They also hope to ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Trump has pledged to sign both measures if they reach his desk. \n \nThough Pence, who describes himself as an \"evangelical Catholic,\" has spoken at the rally before, his speech on Saturday made him the first sitting vice president to do so. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway will also speak. Trump, for his part, has signed an executive order banning US aid to foreign groups that provide abortions. \n \nOne of President Donald Trump's top advisers, Kellyanne Conway, also spoke at the rally. \n \nMajority Republicans in the House and Senate would also like to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which provided more than a third of the nation's abortions in 2014. They also hope to ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Trump has pledged to sign both measures if they reach his desk. \n \nThousands of abortion opponents gathered in the shadow of the Washington Monument for an annual rally that's taken on new energy this year with President Donald Trump in office. \n \nGlenn Miller, a 60-year-old cabinet maker from Coventry, Connecticut, says this is his fourth march and it's easily the most enthusiastic. He says Trump has given a voice to those who oppose abortion and that the previous administration \"didn't care.\" \n \nHe said he voted for Trump reluctantly because he didn't feel like he had a choice. He says he's been encouraged by the administration's actions on abortion so far. \n \nFor the first time in years, abortion opponents will have all the political momentum when they hold their annual rally on the National Mall. \n \nThe March for Life is held each year to mark the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. The group says Vice President Mike Pence will address Friday's rally. The group adds no president or vice president has ever spoken previously at the event, now in its 44th year. \nAmericans remain deeply divided on abortion. The latest Gallup survey, released last spring, found that 47 percent of Americans described themselves as pro-abortion rights and 46 percent as anti-abortion. It also found that 79 percent believed abortion should be legal in either some or all circumstances.\n\nIlyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said that poll shows why abortion-rights supporters should not despair.\n\n\"The vast majority of Americans support Roe v. Wade and support the legal right to abortion,\" Hogue said. \nThe March for Life, however, is running ads arguing that a majority of Americans support some restrictions on abortion and do not believe it should be funded by tax dollars.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Washington DC news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Pence takes part in anti-abortion rally in DC","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"IL","country":"Israel"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Ynet News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658581","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"15"},"name":"Ynet News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ynetnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197794627","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We\u2019re still a little high on the Patriots but nothing to make us move off of that key number.\u201d\n\nStation Casinos dropped New England to minus-150 on the money line, and Atlanta to plus-130, on Friday after it had opened at minus-155 and plus-135.\n\n\u201cWe saw some Atlanta money-line action coming in,\u201d said Esposito.\n\nAs for the total, Esposito said he took some early action on the under but expects to see the bulk of the action on the game in the 72 hours before kickoff.\n\nStation Casinos joined other books in posting a plethora of prop bets on the board Friday, with bettors eagerly poring over 18 pages of them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny how many people walk around with that prop sheet in their hand,\u201d Esposito said. \u201cIt\u2019s become as big a topic as the game itself. It makes up a big piece of big-game Sunday, in the range of 35 percent or more (of the handle) industry-wide now.\u201d\n\nStation has several Las Vegas-themed cross-sport props, including total home runs by local products Kris Bryant and Bryce Harper vs. total pass attempts, the favorite at minus-5½ (minus-115). Bettors can also wager on UNLV football wins vs. total touchdown passes, with the Rebels plus-½, minus-115. Another prop is Golden Knights goals in their 2017-2018 season opener vs. Matt Ryan touchdown passes. Vegas is a pick-em (plus-110).\n\nContact reporter Todd Dewey at tdewey@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0354.

नमस्कार। 26 जनवरी, हमारा \u2018गणतंत्र दिवस\u2019 देश के कोने-कोने में उमंग और उत्साह के साथ हम सबने मनाया। भारत का संविधान, नागरिकों के कर्तव्य, नागरिकों के अधिकार, लोकतंत्र के प्रति हमारी प्रतिबद्धता, एक प्रकार से ये संस्कार उत्सव भी है, जो आने वाली पीढ़ियों को लोकतंत्र के प्रति, लोकतान्त्रिक जिम्मेवारियों के प्रति, जागरूक भी करता है, संस्कारित भी करता है। लेकिन अभी भी हमारे देश में, नागरिकों के कर्तव्य और नागरिकों के अधिकार \u2013 उस पर जितनी बहस होनी चाहिए, जितनी गहराई से बहस होनी चाहिए, जितनी व्यापक रूप में चर्चा होनी चाहिए, वो अभी नहीं हो रही है। मैं आशा करता हूँ कि हर स्तर पर, हर वक़्त, जितना बल अधिकारों पर दिया जाता है, उतना ही बल कर्तव्यों पर भी दिया जाए। अधिकार और कर्तव्य की दो पटरी पर ही, भारत के लोकतंत्र की गाड़ी तेज़ गति से आगे बढ़ सकती है।\n\nकल 30 जनवरी है, हमारे पूज्य बापू की पुण्य तिथि है। 30 जनवरी को हम सब सुबह 11 बजे, 2 मिनट मौन रख करके, देश के लिए प्राण न्योछावर करने वाले शहीदों को श्रद्धांजलि देते हैं। एक समाज के रूप में, एक देश के रूप में, 30 जनवरी, 11 बजे 2 मिनट श्रद्धांजलि, यह सहज स्वभाव बनना चाहिए। 2 मिनट क्यों न हो, लेकिन उसमें सामूहिकता भी, संकल्प भी और शहीदों के प्रति श्रद्धा भी अभिव्यक्त होती है।\n\nहमारे देश में सेना के प्रति, सुरक्षा बलों के प्रति, एक सहज आदर भाव प्रकट होता रहता है। इस गणतंत्र दिवस की पूर्व संध्या पर, विभिन्न वीरता पुरस्कारों से, जो वीर-जवान सम्मानित हुए, उनको, उनके परिवारजनों को, मैं बधाई देता हूँ। इन पुरस्कारों में, \u2018कीर्ति चक्र\u2019, \u2018शौर्य चक्र\u2019, \u2018परम विशिष्ट सेवा मेडल\u2019, \u2018विशिष्ट सेवा मेडल\u2019 \u2013 अनेक श्रेणियाँ हैं। मैं ख़ास करके नौजवानों से आग्रह करना चाहता हूँ। आप social media में बहुत active हैं। आप एक काम कर सकते हैं? इस बार, जिन-जिन वीरों को ये सम्मान मिला है \u2013 आप Net पर खोजिए, उनके संबंध में दो अच्छे शब्द लिखिए और अपने साथियों में उसको पहुँचाइए। जब उनके साहस की, वीरता की, पराक्रम की बात को गहराई से जानते हैं, तो हमें आश्चर्य भी होता है, गर्व भी होता है, प्रेरणा भी मिलती है।\n\nएक तरफ़ हम सब 26 जनवरी की उमंग और उत्साह की ख़बरों से आनंदित थे, तो उसी समय कश्मीर में हमारे जो सेना के जवान देश की रक्षा में डटे हुए हैं, वे हिमस्खलन के कारण वीर-गति को प्राप्त हुए। मैं इन सभी वीर जवानों को आदरपूर्वक श्रद्धांजलि देता हूँ, नमन करता हूँ।\n\nमेरे युवा साथियो, आप तो भली-भाँति जानते हैं कि मैं \u2018मन की बात\u2019 लगातार करता रहता हूँ। जनवरी, फ़रवरी, मार्च, अप्रैल \u2013 ये सारे महीने हर परिवार में, कसौटी के महीने होते हैं। घर में एक-आध, दो बच्चों की exam होती हैं, लेकिन पूरा परिवार exam के बोझ में दबा हुआ होता है। तो मेरा मन कर गया कि ये सही समय है कि मैं विद्यार्थी दोस्तों से बातें करूँ, उनके अभिवावकों से बातें करूँ, उनके शिक्षकों से बातें करूँ। क्योंकि कई वर्षों से, मैं जहाँ गया, जिसे मिला, परीक्षा एक बहुत बड़ा परेशानी का कारण नज़र आया। परिवार परेशान, विद्यार्थी परेशान, शिक्षक परेशान, एक बड़ा विचित्र सा मनोवैज्ञानिक वातावरण हर घर में नज़र आता है। और मुझे हमेशा ये लगा है कि इसमें से बाहर आना चाहिये और इसलिये मैं आज युवा साथियों के साथ कुछ विस्तार से बातें करना चाहता हूँ। जब ये विषय मैंने घोषित किया, तो अनेक शिक्षकों ने, अभिभावकों ने, विद्यार्थियों ने मुझे message भेजे, सवाल भेजे, सुझाव भेजे, पीड़ा भी व्यक्त की, परेशानियों का भी ज़िक्र किया और उसको देखने के बाद जो मेरे मन में विचार आए, वो मैं आज आपके साथ साझा करना चाहता हूँ। मुझे एक टेलीफोन सन्देश मिला सृष्टि का। आप भी सुनिए, सृष्टि क्या कह रही है: \u2013\n\n\u201cसर, मैं आपसे इतना कहना चाहती हूँ कि exams के time पे अक्सर ऐसा होता है कि हमारे घर में, आस-पड़ोस में, हमारी society में बहुत ही ख़ौफ़नाक और डरावना माहौल बन जाता है। इस वजह से student Inspiration तो कम, लेकिन down बहुत हो जाते है। तो मैं आपसे इतना पूछना चाहती हूँ कि क्या ये माहौल ख़ुशनुमा नहीं हो सकता?\u201d\n\nखैर, सवाल तो सृष्टि ने पूछा है, लेकिन ये सवाल आप सबके मन में होगा। परीक्षा अपने-आप में एक ख़ुशी का अवसर होना चाहिये। साल भर मेहनत की है, अब बताने का अवसर आया है, ऐसा उमंग-उत्साह का ये पर्व होना चाहिए। बहुत कम लोग हैं, जिनके लिए exam में pleasure होती है, ज़्यादातर लोगों के लिए exam एक pressure होती है। निर्णय आपको करना है कि इसे आप pleasure मानेंगे कि pressure मानेंगे। जो pleasure मानेगा, वो पायेगा; जो pressure मानेगा, वो पछताएगा। और इसलिये मेरा मत है कि परीक्षा एक उत्सव है, परीक्षा को ऐसे लीजिए, जैसे मानो त्योहार है। और जब त्योहार होता है, जब उत्सव होता है, तो हमारे भीतर जो सबसे best होता है, वही बाहर निकल कर के आता है। समाज की भी ताक़त की अनुभूति उत्सव के समय होती है। जो उत्तम से उत्तम है, वो प्रकट होता है। सामान्य रूप से हमको लगता है कि हम लोग कितने Indisciplined हैं, लेकिन जब 40-45 दिन चलने वाले कुम्भ के मेलों की व्यवस्था देखें, तो पता चलता है कि ये make-shift arrangement और क्या discipline है लोगों में। ये उत्सव की ताक़त है। exam में भी पूरे परिवार में, मित्रों के बीच, आस-पड़ोस के बीच एक उत्सव का माहौल बनना चाहिये। आप देखिए, ये pressure, pleasure में convert हो जाएगा। उत्सवपूर्ण वातावरण बोझमुक्त बना देगा। और मैं इसमें माता-पिता को ज़्यादा आग्रह से कहता हूँ कि आप इन तीन-चार महीने एक उत्सव का वातावरण बनाइए। पूरा परिवार एक टीम के रूप में इस उत्सव को सफल करने के लिए अपनी-अपनी भूमिका उत्साह से निभाए। देखिए, देखते ही देखते बदलाव आ जाएगा। हक़ीक़त तो ये है कि कन्याकुमारी से कश्मीर तक और कच्छ से ले करके कामरूप तक, अमरेली से ले करके अरुणाचल प्रदेश तक, ये तीन-चार महीने परीक्षा ही परीक्षायें होती हैं। ये हम सब का दायित्व है कि हम हर वर्ष इन तीन-चार महीनों को अपने-अपने तरीक़े से, अपनी-अपनी परंपरा को लेते हुए, अपने-अपने परिवार के वातावरण को लेते हुए, उत्सव में परिवर्तित करें। और इसलिए मैं तो आपसे कहूँगा \u2018smile more score more\u2019. जितनी ज़्यादा ख़ुशी से इस समय को बिताओगे, उतने ही ज़्यादा नंबर पाओगे, करके देखिए। और आपने देखा होगा कि जब आप खुश होते हैं, मुस्कुराते हैं, तो आप relax अपने-आप को पाते हैं। आप सहज रूप से relax हो जाते हैं और जब आप relax होते हैं, तो आपकी वर्षों पुरानी बातें भी सहज रूप से आपको याद आ जाती हैं। एक साल पहले classroom में teacher ने क्या कहा, पूरा दृश्य याद आ जाता है। और आपको ये पता होना चाहिए, memory को recall करने का जो power है, वो relaxation में सबसे ज़्यादा होता है। अगर आप तनाव में है, तो सारे दरवाज़े बंद हो जाते हैं, बाहर का अंदर नहीं जाता, अंदर का बाहर नहीं आता है। विचार प्रक्रिया में ठहराव आ जाता है, वो अपने-आप में एक बोझ बन जाता है। exam में भी आपने देखा होगा, आपको सब याद आता है। किताब याद आती है, chapter याद आता है, page number याद आता है, page में ऊपर की तरफ़ लिखा है कि नीचे की तरफ़, वो भी याद आता है, लेकिन वो particular शब्द याद नहीं आता है। लेकिन जैसे ही exam दे करके बाहर निकलते हो और थोड़ा सा कमरे के बाहर आए, अचानक आपको याद आ जाता है \u2013 हाँ यार, यही शब्द था। अंदर क्यों याद नहीं आया, pressure था। बाहर कैसे याद आया? आप ही तो थे, किसी ने बताया तो नहीं था। लेकिन जो अंदर था, तुरंत बाहर आ गया और बाहर इसलिये आया, क्योंकि आप relax हो गए। और इसलिये memory recall करने की सबसे बड़ी अगर कोई औषधि है, तो वो relaxation है। और ये मैं अपने स्वानुभव से कहता हूँ कि अगर pressure है, तो अपनी चीज़ें हम भूल जाते हैं और relax हैं, तो कभी हम कल्पना नहीं कर सकते, अचानक ऐसी-ऐसी चीज़ें याद आ जाती हैं, वो बहुत काम आ जाती हैं। और ऐसा नहीं है कि आप के पास knowledge नहीं है, ऐसा नहीं है कि आप के पास Information नहीं है, ऐसा नहीं है कि आपने मेहनत नहीं की है। लेकिन जब tension होता है, तब आपका knowledge, आपका ज्ञान, आपकी जानकारी नीचे दब जाती हैं और आपका tension उस पर सवार हो जाता है। और इसलिये आवश्यक है, \u2018A happy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet\u2019. कभी-कभी ये भी लगता है कि हम proper perspective में परीक्षा को देख नहीं पाते हैं। ऐसा लगता है कि वो जीवन-मरण का जैसे सवाल है। आप जो exam देने जा रहे हैं, वो साल भर में आपने जो पढ़ाई की है, उसकी exam है। ये आपके जीवन की कसौटी नहीं है। आपने कैसा जीवन जिया, कैसा जीवन जी रहे हो, कैसा जीवन जीना चाहते हो, उसकी exam नहीं है। आपके जीवन में, classroom में, notebook ले करके दी गई परीक्षा के सिवाय भी कई कसौटियों से गुज़रने के अवसर आए होंगे। और इसलिये, परीक्षा को जीवन की सफलता-विफलता से कोई लेना-देना है, ऐसे बोझ से मुक्त हो जाइए। हमारे सबके सामने, हमारे पूर्व राष्ट्रपति डॉ. ए.पी.जे. अब्दुल कलाम जी का बड़ा प्रेरक उदाहरण है। वे वायुसेना में भर्ती होने गए, fail हो गए। मान लीजिए, उस विफलता के कारण अगर वो मायूस हो जाते, ज़िंदगी से हार जाते, तो क्या भारत को इतना बड़ा वैज्ञानिक मिलता, इतने बड़े राष्ट्रपति मिलते! नहीं मिलते। कोई ऋचा आनंद जी ने मुझे एक सवाल भेजा है: \u2013\n\n\u201cआज के इस दौर में शिक्षा के सामने जो सबसे बड़ी चुनौती देख पाती हूँ, वो यह कि शिक्षा परीक्षा केन्द्रित हो कर रह गयी है। अंक सबसे ज़्यादा महत्वपूर्ण हो गए हैं। इसकी वजह से प्रतिस्पर्द्धा तो बहुत बढ़ी ही है, साथ में विद्यार्थियों में तनाव भी बहुत बढ़ गया है। तो शिक्षा की इस वर्तमान दिशा और इसके भविष्य को ले करके आपके विचारों से अवगत होना चाहूँगी।\u201d\n\nवैसे उन्होंने ख़ुद ने ही जवाब दे ही दिया है, लेकिन ऋचा जी चाहती हैं कि मैं भी इसमें कुछ अपनी बात रखूँ। marks और marks-sheet इसका एक सीमित उपयोग है। ज़िंदगी में वही सब कुछ नहीं होता है। ज़िंदगी तो चलती है कि आपने कितना ज्ञान अर्जित किया है। ज़िंदगी तो चलती है कि आपने जो जाना है, उसको जीने का प्रयास किया है क्या? ज़िंदगी तो चलती है कि आपको जो एक sense of mission मिला है और जो आपका sense of ambition है, ये आपके mission और ambition के बीच में कोई तालमेल हो रहा है क्या? अगर आप इन चीज़ों में भरोसा करोगे, तो marks पूँछ दबाते हुए आपके पीछे आ जाएँगे; आपको marks के पीछे भागने की कभी ज़रुरत नहीं पड़ेगी। जीवन में आपको knowledge काम आने वाला है, skill काम आने वाली है, आत्मविश्वास काम आने वाला है, संकल्पशक्ति काम आने वाली है। आप ही मुझे बताइए, आपके परिवार के कोई डॉक्टर होंगे और परिवार के सब लोग उन्हीं के पास जाते होंगे, family doctor होते हैं। आप में से कोई ऐसा नहीं होगा, जिसने अपने family doctor को कभी, वो कितने नंबर से पास हुआ था, पूछा होगा। किसी ने नहीं पूछा होगा। बस, आपको लगा कि भाई, एक डॉक्टर के नाते अच्छे हैं, आप लोगो को लाभ हो रहा है, आप उसकी सेवाएँ लेना शुरू किए। आप कोई बड़ा से बड़ा case लड़ने के लिए किसी वकील के पास जाते हैं, तो क्या उस वकील की marks-sheet देखते हैं क्या? आप उसके अनुभव को, उसके ज्ञान को, उसकी सफलता की यात्रा को देखते हैं। और इसलिये ये जो अंक का बोझ है, वो भी कभी-कभी हमें सही दिशा में जाने से रोक देता है। लेकिन इसका मतलब ये नहीं कि मैं ये कहूँ कि बस, पढ़ना ही नहीं है। अपनी कसौटी के लिए उसका उपयोग ज़रुर है। मैं कल था, आज कहाँ हूँ, वो जानने के लिए ज़रुरी है। कभी-कभार ये भी होता है और अगर बारीक़ी से आप अपने स्वयं के जीवन को देखोगे, तो ध्यान में आएगा कि अगर अंक के पीछे पड़ गए, तो आप shortest रास्ते खोजोगे, selected चीजों को ही पकड़ोगे और उसी पर focus करोगे। लेकिन आपने जिन चीज़ों पर हाथ लगाया था, उसके बाहर की कोई चीज़ आ गई, आपने जो सवाल तैयार किए थे, उससे बाहर का सवाल आ गया, तो आप एकदम से नीचे आ जाएँगे। अगर आप ज्ञान को केंद्र में रखते हैं, तो बहुत चीज़ों को अपने में समेटने का प्रयास करते हो। लेकिन अंक पर focus करते हो, marks पर focus करते हो, तो आप धीरे-धीरे अपने-आप को सिकुड़ते जाते हो और एक निश्चित area तक अपने आपको सीमित करके सिर्फ marks पाने के लिये। तो हो सकता है कि exam में होनहार बनने के बावजूद भी जीवन में कभी-कभी विफल हो जाते हैं।\n\nऋचा जी, ने एक बात ये भी कही है \u2018प्रतिस्पर्द्धा\u2019। ये एक बहुत बड़ी मनोवैज्ञानिक लड़ाई है। सचमुच में, जीवन को आगे बढ़ाने के लिए प्रतिस्पर्द्धा काम नहीं आती है। जीवन को आगे बढ़ाने के लिए अनुस्पर्द्धा काम आती है और जब हम अनुस्पर्द्धा मैं कहता हूँ, तो उसका मतलब है, स्वयं से स्पर्द्धा करना। बीते हुए कल से आने वाला कल बेहतर कैसे हो? बीते हुए परिणाम से आने वाला अवसर अधिक बेहतर कैसे हो? अक्सर आपने खेल जगत में देखा होगा। क्योंकि उसमें तुरंत समझ आता है, इसलिए मैं खेल जगत का उदहारण देता हूँ। ज़्यादातर सफल खिलाड़ियों के जीवन की एक विशेषता है कि वो अनुस्पर्द्धा करते हैं। अगर हम श्रीमान सचिन तेंदुलकर जी का ही उदहारण ले लें। बीस साल लगातार अपने ही record तोड़ते जाना, खुद को ही हर बार पराजित करना और आगे बढ़ना। बड़ी अदभुत जीवन यात्रा है उनकी, क्योंकि उन्होंने प्रतिस्पर्द्धा से ज्यादा अनुस्पर्द्धा का रास्ता अपनाया।\n\nजीवन के हर क्षेत्र में दोस्तो और जब आप exam देने जा रहे हैं तब, पहले अगर दो घंटे पढ़ पाते थे शान्ति से, वो तीन घंटे कर पाते हो क्या? पहले जितने बजे सुबह उठना तय करते थे, देर हो जाती थी, क्या अब समय पर उठ पाते हो क्या? पहले परीक्षा की tension में नींद नहीं आती थी, अब नींद आती है क्या? ख़ुद को ही आप कसौटी पर कस लीजिए और आपको ध्यान में आएगा \u2013 प्रतिस्पर्द्धा में पराजय, हताशा, निराशा और ईर्ष्या को जन्म देती है, लेकिन अनुस्पर्द्धा आत्मंथन, आत्मचिंतन का कारण बनती है, संकल्प शक्ति को दृढ़ बनाती है और जब ख़ुद को पराजित करते हैं, तो और अधिक आगे बढ़ने का उत्साह अपने-आप पैदा होता है, बाहर से कोई extra energy की ज़रूरत नहीं पड़ती है। भीतर से ही वो ऊर्जा अपने-आप पैदा होती है। अगर सरल भाषा में मुझे कहना है, तो मैं कहूँगा \u2013 जब आप किसी से प्रतिस्पर्द्धा करते हैं, तो तीन संभावनायें मोटी-मोटी नज़र आती हैं। एक, आप उससे बहुत बेहतर हैं। दूसरा, आप उससे बहुत ख़राब हैं या आप उसके बराबर के हैं। अगर आप बेहतर हैं तो बेपरवाह हो जाएँगे, अति विश्वास से भर जाएँगे। अगर आप उसके मुक़ाबले ख़राब करते हैं, तब दुखी और निराश हो जाएँगे, ईर्ष्या से भर जाएँगे, जो ईर्ष्या आपको, अपने-आप को, खाती जाएगी और अगर बराबरी के हैं, तो सुधार की आवश्यकता आप कभी महसूस ही नहीं करोगे। जैसी गाड़ी चलती है, चलते रहोगे। तो मेरा आपसे आग्रह है \u2013 अनुस्पर्द्धा का, ख़ुद से स्पर्द्धा करने का। पहले क्या किया था, उससे आगे कैसे करूँगा, अच्छा कैसे करूँगा। बस, इसी पर ध्यान केंद्रित कीजिए। आप देखिए, आपको बहुत परिवर्तन महसूस होगा।\n\nश्रीमान एस. सुन्दर जी ने अभिभावकों की भूमिका के संबंध में अपनी भावना व्यक्त की है। उनका कहना है कि परीक्षा में अभिभावकों की भूमिका बहुत ही महत्वपूर्ण होती है। उन्होंने आगे लिखा है \u2013 \u201cमेरी माँ पढ़ी-लिखी नहीं थी, फिर भी वह मेरे पास बैठा करती थी और मुझसे गणित के सवाल हल करने के लिये कहती थी। वह उत्तर मिलाती और इस तरह से वो मेरी मदद करती थी। ग़लतियाँ ठीक करती थी। मेरी माँ ने दसवीं की परीक्षा pass नहीं की, लेकिन बिना उनके सहयोग के मेरे लिये C.B.S.E. के exam pass करना नामुमकिन था।\u201d\n\nसुन्दर जी, आपकी बात सही है और आज भी देखा होगा आपने, मुझे सवाल पूछने वाले, सुझाव देने वालों में महिलाओं की संख्या ज़्यादा है, क्योंकि घर में बालकों के भविष्य के संबंध में मातायें जो सजग होती हैं, सक्रिय होती हैं, वे बहुत चीज़ें सरल कर देती हैं। मैं अभिभावकों से इतना ही कहना चाहूँगा \u2013 तीन बातों पर हम बल दें। स्वीकारना, सिखाना, समय देना। जो है, उसे accept कीजिए। आपके पास जितनी क्षमता है, आप mentor कीजिए, आप कितने ही व्यस्त क्यों न हों, समय निकालिए, time दीजिए। एक बार आप accept करना सीख लेंगे, अधिकतम समस्या तो वही समाप्त हो जाएगी। हर अभिभावक इस बात को अनुभव करता होगा, अभिभावकों का, टीचरों का expectation समस्या की जड़ में होता है। acceptance समस्याओं के समाधान का रास्ता खोलता है। अपेक्षायें राह कठिन कर देती हैं। अवस्था को स्वीकार करना, नए रास्ते खोलने का अवसर देती है और इसलिए जो है, उसे accept कीजिए। आप भी बोझमुक्त हो जाएँगे। हम लोग, छोटे बच्चों के school bag के वज़न की चर्चा करते रहते हैं, लेकिन कभी-कभी तो मुझे लगता है कि अभिभावकों की जो अपेक्षायें होती हैं, उम्मीदें होती हैं, वो बच्चे के school bag से भी ज़रा ज़्यादा भारी हो जाती हैं।\n\nबहुत साल पहले की बात है। हमारे एक परिचित व्यक्ति heart attack के कारण अस्पताल में थे, तो हमारे भारत के लोक सभा के पहले Speaker गणेश दादा मावलंकर, उनके पुत्र पुरुषोत्तम मावलंकर, वो कभी M.P. भी रहे थे, वो उनकी तबीयत देखने आए। मैं उस समय मौजूद था और मैंने देखा कि उन्होंने आ करके उनकी तबीयत के संबंध में एक भी सवाल नहीं पूछा। बैठे और आते ही उन्होंने वहाँ क्या स्थिति है, बीमारी कैसी है, कोई बातें नहीं, चुटकुले सुनाना शुरू कर दिया और पहले दो-चार मिनट में ही ऐसा माहौल उन्होंने हल्का-फुल्का कर दिया। एक प्रकार से बीमार व्यक्ति को जाकर के जैसे हम बीमारी से डरा देते हैं। अभिभावकों से मैं कहना चाहूँगा, कभी-कभी हम भी बच्चों के साथ ऐसा ही करते हैं। क्या आपको कभी लगा कि exam के दिनों में बच्चों को हँसी-ख़ुशी का भी कोई माहौल दें। आप देखिए, वातावरण बदल जाएगा।\n\nएक बड़ा कमाल का मुझे phone call आया है। वे सज्जन अपना नाम बताना नहीं चाहते हैं। phone सुन कर के आपको पता चलेगा कि वो अपना नाम क्यों नहीं बताना चाहते हैं?\n\n\u201cनमस्कार, प्रधानमंत्री जी, मैं अपना नाम तो नहीं बता सकता, क्योंकि मैंने काम ही कुछ ऐसा किया था अपने बचपन में। मैंने बचपन में एक बार नक़ल करने की कोशिश की थी, उसके लिये मैंने बहुत तैयारी करना शुरू किया कि मैं कैसे नक़ल कर सकता हूँ, उसके तरीक़ों को ढूँढ़ने की कोशिश की, जिसकी वजह से मेरा बहुत सारा time बर्बाद हो गया। उस time में मैं पढ़ करके भी उतने ही नंबर ला सकता था, जितना मैंने नक़ल करने के लिए दिमाग लगाने में ख़र्च किया। और जब मैंने नक़ल करके पास होने की कोशिश की, तो मैं उसमें पकड़ा भी गया और मेरी वजह से मेरे आस-पास के कई दोस्तों को काफ़ी परेशानी हुई।\u201d\n\nआपकी बात सही है। ये जो short-cut वाले रास्ते होते हैं, वो नक़ल करने के लिये कारण बन जाते हैं। कभी-कभार ख़ुद पर विश्वास नहीं होने के कारण मन करता है कि बगल वाले से ज़रा देख लूँ, confirm कर लूँ, मैंने जो लिखा है, सही है कि नहीं है और कभी-कभी तो हमने सही लिखा होता है, लेकिन बगल वाले ने झूठा लिखा होता है, तो उसी झूठ को हम कभी स्वीकार कर लेते हैं और हम भी मर जाते हैं। तो नक़ल कभी फ़ायदा नहीं करती है। \u2018To cheat।s to be cheap, so please, do not cheat\u2019। नक़ल आपको बुरा बनाती है, इसलिये नक़ल न करें। आपने कई बार और बार-बार ये सुना होगा कि नक़ल मत करना, नक़ल मत करना। मैं भी आपको वही बात दोबारा कह रहा हूँ। नक़ल को आप हर रूप में देख लीजिए, वो जीवन को विफल बनाने के रास्ते की ओर आपको घसीट के ले जा रही है और exam में ही अगर निरीक्षक ने पकड़ लिया, तो आपका तो सब-कुछ बर्बाद हो जाएगा और मान लीजिए, किसी ने नहीं पकड़ा, तो जीवन पर आपके मन पर एक बोझ तो रहेगा कि आपने ऐसा किया था और जब कभी आपको अपने बच्चों को समझाना होगा, तो आप आँख में आँख मिला कर के नहीं समझा पाओगे। और एक बार नक़ल की आदत लग गई, तो जीवन में कभी कुछ सीखने की इच्छा ही नहीं रहेगी। फिर तो आप कहाँ पहुँच पाओगे?\n\nमान लीजिए, आप भी अपने रास्तों को गड्ढे में परिवर्तित कर रहे हो और मैंने तो देखा है, कुछ लोग ऐसे होते हैं कि नक़ल के तौर-तरीक़े ढूँढ़ने में इतनी talent का उपयोग कर देते हैं, इतना Investment कर देते हैं; अपनी पूरी creativity जो है, वो नक़ल करने के तौर-तरीक़ों में खपा देते हैं। अगर वही creativity, यही time आप अपने exam के मुद्दों पर देते, तो शायद नक़ल की ही ज़रुरत नहीं पड़ती। अपनी ख़ुद की मेहनत से जो परिणाम प्राप्त होगा, उससे जो आत्मविश्वास बढ़ेगा, वो अद्भुत होगा।\n\nएक phone call आया है: \u2013\n\n\u201cनमस्कार, प्रधानमंत्री जी। My name is Monica and since I am a class 12th student, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions regarding the Board Exams. My first question is, what can we do to reduce the stress that builds up during our exams and my second question is, why exams all about work and no play are. Thank you.\u201d\n\nअगर परीक्षा के दिनों में, मैं आपको खेल-कूद की बात करूँगा, तो आपके teacher, आपके parents ये मुझ पर गुस्सा करेंगे, वो नाराज़ हो जाएँगे कि ये कैसा प्रधानमंत्री है, बच्चों को exam के समय में कह रहा है, खेलो। क्योंकि आम तौर पर धारणा ऐसी है कि अगर विद्यार्थी खेल-कूद में ध्यान देते हैं, तो शिक्षा से बेध्यान हो जाते हैं। ये मूलभूत धारणा ही ग़लत है, समस्या की जड़ वो ही है। सर्वांगीण विकास करना है, तो किताबों के बाहर भी एक ज़िन्दगी होती है और वो बहुत बड़ी विशाल होती है। उसको भी जीने का सीखने का यही समय होता है। कोई ये कहे कि मैं पहले सारी परीक्षायें पूर्ण कर लूँ, बाद में खेलूँगा, बाद में ये करूँगा, तो असंभव है। जीवन का यही तो moulding का time होता है। इसी को तो परवरिश कहते हैं। दरअसल परीक्षा में मेरी दृष्टि से तीन बातें बहुत ज़रुरी हैं \u2013 proper rest आराम, दूसरा जितनी आवश्यक है शरीर के लिये, उतनी नींद और तीसरा दिमागी activity के सिवाय भी शरीर एक बहुत बड़ा हिस्सा है। तो शरीर के बाकी हिस्सों को भी physical activity मिलनी चाहिए। क्या कभी सोचा है कि जब इतना सारा सामने हो, तो दो पल बाहर निकल कर ज़रा आसमान में देखें, ज़रा पेड़-पौधों की तरफ देखें, थोड़ा-सा मन को हल्का करें, आप देखिए, एक ताज़गी के साथ फिर से आप अपने कमरे में, अपनी किताबों के बीच आएँगे। आप जो भी कर रहे हों, थोड़ा break लीजिए, उठ करके बाहर जाइए, kitchen में जाइए, अपनी पसंद की कोई चीज़ है, ज़रा खोजिए, अपनी पसंद का biscuit मिल जाए, तो खाइए, थोड़ी हँसी-मज़ाक कर लीजिए। भले पांच मिनट क्यों न हो, लेकिन आप break दीजिए। आपको महसूस होगा कि आपका काम सरल होता जा रहा है। सबको ये पसंद है कि नहीं, मुझे मालूम नहीं, लेकिन मेरा तो अनुभव है। ऐसे समय deep breathing करते हैं, तो बहुत फ़ायदा होता है। गहरी साँस आप देखिए बहुत relax हो जाता है। गहरी साँस भी लेने के लिये कोई कमरे में fit रहने की ज़रुरत नहीं है। ज़रा खुले आसमान के नीचे आएँ, छत पर चले जाएँ, पांच मिनट गहरी साँस ले करके फिर अपने पढ़ने के लिए बैठ जाएँ, आप देखिए, शरीर एक दम से relax हो जाएगा और शरीर का जो relaxation आप अनुभव करते हैं न, वो दिमागी अंगों का भी उतना ही relaxation कर देता है। कुछ लोगों को लगता है, रात को देर-देर जागेंगे, ज़्यादा-ज़्यादा पढ़ेंगे \u2013 जी नहीं, शरीर को जितनी नींद की आवश्यकता है, वो अवश्य लीजिए, उससे आपका पढ़ने का समय बर्बाद नहीं होगा, वो पढ़ने की ताक़त में इज़ाफ़ा करेगा। आपका concentration बढ़ेगा, आपकी ताज़गी आएगी, freshness होगा। आपकी efficiency में overall बहुत बड़ी बढ़ोतरी होगी। मैं जब चुनाव में सभायें करता हूँ, तो कभी-कभी मेरी आवाज़ बैठ जाती है। तो मुझे एक लोक गायक मिलने आए। उन्होंने मुझे आकर के पूछा \u2013 आप कितने घंटे सोते हैं। मैंने कहा \u2013 क्यों भाई, आप डॉक्टर हैं क्या? नहीं-नहीं, बोले \u2013 ये आपका आवाज़ जो चुनाव के समय भाषण करते-करते ख़राब हो जाता है, उसका इसके साथ संबंध है। आप पूरी नींद लेंगे, तभी आपके vocal cord को पूरा rest मिलेगा। अब मैंने नींद को और मेरे भाषण को और मेरी आवाज़ को कभी सोचा ही नहीं था, उन्होंने मुझे एक जड़ी-बूटी दे दी। तो सचमुच में हम इन चीज़ों का महत्व समझें, आप देखिए, आपको फ़ायदा होगा। लेकिन इसका मतलब ये नहीं कि बस सोते ही रहें, लेकिन कुछ कहेंगे कि प्रधानमंत्री जी ने कह दिया है, अब बस जागने की ज़रुरत नहीं है, सोते रहना है। तो ऐसा मत करना, वरना आपके परिवार के लोग मेरे से नाराज़ हो जाएँगे। और आपकी अगर marks-sheet जिस दिन आएगी, तो उनको आप नहीं दिखाई दोगे, मैं ही दिखाई दूँगा। तो ऐसा मत करना। और इसलिये मैं तो कहूँगा \u2018P for prepared and P for play\u2019, जो खेले वो खिले, \u2018the person who plays, shines\u2019. मन, बुद्धि, शरीर उसको सचेत रखने के लिये ये एक बहुत बड़ी औषधि है।\n\nख़ैर, युवा दोस्तो, आप परीक्षा की तैयारी में हैं और मैं आपको मन की बातों में जकड़ कर बैठा हूँ। हो सकता है, ये आज की मेरी बातें भी तो आपके लिये relaxation का तो काम करेंगी ही करेंगी। लेकिन मैं साथ-साथ ये भी कहूँगा, मैंने जो बातें बताई हैं, उसको भी बोझ मत बनने दीजिए। हो सकता है तो करिए, नहीं हो सकता तो मत कीजिए, वरना ये भी एक बोझ बन जाएगा। तो जैसे मैं आपके परिवार के माता-पिता को बोझ न बनने देने की सलाह देता हूँ, वो मुझ पर भी लागू होती हैं। अपने संकल्प को याद करते हुए, अपने पर विश्वास रखते हुए, परीक्षा के लिये जाइए, मेरी बहुत शुभकामनायें हैं । हर कसौटी से पार उतरने के लिये कसौटी को उत्सव बना दीजिए। फिर कभी कसौटी, कसौटी ही नहीं रहेगी। इस मंत्र को ले करके आगे बढ़ें।\n\nप्यारे देशवासियो, 1 फरवरी 2017 Indian Coast Guard के 40 वर्ष पूरे हो रहे हैं। इस अवसर पर मैं Coast Guard के सभी अधिकारियों एवं जवानों को राष्ट्र के प्रति उनकी सेवा के लिये धन्यवाद देता हूँ। ये गर्व की बात है कि Coast Guard देश में निर्मित अपने सभी 126 ships और 62 aircrafts के साथ विश्व के 4 सबसे बड़े Coast Guard के बीच अपना स्थान बनाए हुए है। Coast Guard का मंत्र है \u2018वयम् रक्षामः\u2019। अपने इस आदर्श वाक्य को चरितार्थ करते हुए, देश की समुद्री सीमाओं और समुद्री परिवेश को सुरक्षित करने के लिये Coast Guard के जवान प्रतिकूल परिस्थितियों में भी दिन-रात तत्पर रहते हैं। पिछले वर्ष Coast Guard के लोगों ने अपनी जिम्मेवारियों के साथ-साथ हमारे देश के समुद्र तट को स्वच्छ बनाने का बड़ा अभियान उठाया था और हज़ारों लोग इसमें शरीक़ हुए थे। Coastal Security के साथ-साथ Coastal Cleanness इसकी भी चिंता की उन्होंने, ये सचमुच में बधाई के पात्र हैं। और बहुत कम लोगों को मालूम होगा कि हमारे देश में Coast Guard में सिर्फ़ पुरुष नहीं हैं, महिलायें भी कन्धे से कन्धा मिला कर समान रूप से अपनी जिम्मेवारियाँ निभा रहीं हैं और सफलतापूर्वक निभा रहीं हैं। Coast Guard की हमारी महिला अफ़सर Pilot हों, Observers के रूप में काम हों, इतना ही नहीं, Hovercraft की कमान भी संभालती हैं। भारत के तटीय सुरक्षा में लगे हुए और सामुद्रिक सुरक्षा एक महत्वपूर्ण विषय आज विश्व का बना हुआ है, तब मैं Indian Coast Guard के 40वीं वर्षगांठ पर उनको बहुत-बहुत बधाई देता हूँ।\n\n1 फरवरी को वसन्त पंचमी का त्यौहार है, वसन्त \u2013 ये सर्वश्रेष्ठ ऋतु के रूप में, उसको स्वीकृति मिली हुई है। वसन्त \u2013 ये ऋतुओं का राजा है। हमारे देश में वसन्त पंचमी सरस्वती पूजा का एक बहुत बड़ा त्योहार होता है। विद्या की आराधना का अवसर माना जाता है। इतना ही नहीं, वीरों के लिए प्रेरणा का भी पर्व होता है। \u2018मेरा रंग दे बसंती चोला\u2019 \u2013 ये वही तो प्रेरणा है। इस वसन्त पंचमी के पावन त्योहार पर मेरी देशवासियों को बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनायें हैं।\n\nमेरे प्यारे देशवासियो, \u2018मन की बात\u2019 में आकाशवाणी भी अपनी कल्पकता के साथ हमेशा नये रंग-रूप भरता रहता है। पिछले महीने से उन्होंने मेरी \u2018मन की बात\u2019 पूर्ण होने के तुरंत बाद प्रादेशिक भाषाओं में \u2018मन की बात\u2019 सुनाना शुरू किया है। इसको व्यापक स्वीकृति मिली है। दूर-दूर से लोग चिट्ठियाँ लिख रहे हैं। मैं आकाशवाणी को उनके इस स्वयं प्रेरणा से किए गए काम के लिये बहुत-बहुत अभिनन्दन करता हूँ। देशवासियो, में आपका भी बहुत अभिनन्दन करता हूँ। \u2018मन की बात\u2019 मुझे आपसे जुड़ने का एक बहुत बड़ा अवसर देती है। बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनायें। धन्यवाद। ***AKT/SH","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Text of PM's 'Mann Ki Baat' address on All India Radio on January 29, 2017","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Foreign Affairs.co.nz","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"546393502","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"79"},"name":"Foreign Affairs.co.nz","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://foreignaffairs.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197801451","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:43Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Under LaFleur and Shanahan, Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan had the most prolific season of his nine-year career and stands a very good chance of being named the league\u2019s MVP for 2016.LaFleur also spent four seasons in the same role in Washington working with Shanahan and Shanahan\u2019s father, Mike. Their most famous pupil at the time was then-rookie Robert Griffin III, who set a Washington rookie record in 2012 in passing yards (3,200). More significant now, LaFleur was on hand when Washington drafted and developed quarterback Kirk Cousins, someone the 49ers could pursue if he becomes an unrestricted free agent in March. Team officials in Washington, however, uniformly said this week that they want Cousins back for the 2017 season and could give him the franchise tag for the second straight year.\n\nLaFleur also worked under Kyle Shanahan in Houston in 2008 and 2009, when Shanahan was the Texans\u2019 offensive coordinator and LaFleur worked with the quarterbacks and receivers.\n\nBefore last week\u2019s NFC championship game, Fox News reported that the Falcons already had a list of possible replacements for Shanahan at offensive coordinator, including former 49ers head coach Chip Kelly. LaFleur also might be among candidates. If not, he could wind up as the 49ers\u2019 offensive coordinator. His brother, Mike, also is an offensive assistant in Atlanta and presumably would join Matt if he came to San Francisco.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown at this point whom the 49ers would hire as their defensive coordinator. The team pursued former Jaguars coach Gus Bradley, who joined the Chargers instead, and was told that former 49ers defensive coordinator Vic Fangio would not be allowed out of his contract in Chicago. Panthers defensive-line coach Eric Washington also has been discussed as a possibility.\n\nAs far as special teams, multiple sources have said Richard Hightower is could become the coordinator. Hightower, currently the Bears\u2019 assistant special-teams coach, in 2014 was an offensive quality control coach in Cleveland, where he worked under Shanahan, the Browns\u2019 offensive coordinator at the time. Hightower also was in Washington for four seasons under the Shanahans.\n\nHightower also served as an assistant to 49ers special-teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey in 2015.\n\nMatt Barrows: @mattbarrows, read more about the team at sacbee.com/sf49ers.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Barrowsmbarrows@sacbee.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - San Francisco 49ers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Shanahan could bring two longtime lieutenants with him to 49ers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Stanislaus","zipCode":"95350","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Modesto","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Modesto Bee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657476","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"584"},"name":"Modesto Bee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["AmericanFootball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.modbee.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.sacbee.com/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers/article127562049.html","http://www.sacbee.com/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers/article128726979.html","https://twitter.com/mattbarrows","http://www.sacbee.com/sf49ers"],"sequenceId":"695197805957","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:06Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.modbee.com/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers/v8j72u/picture129444544/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_1140/LaFleur"}],"video":[]}}

Without funds for an attorney, I accepted deferred probation. It has followed me my entire life. \n \nI graduated from college, law, and graduate school, yet I had to endure a hearing to ascertain my fitness to practice. It also caused employment rejection. \n \nLater, as assistant county attorney in El Paso, and elected district attorney in Willacy County, I routinely dismissed pot cases. Prosecutor\u2019s offices have limited budgets, yet mountains of cases. Dismissing marijuana offenses, allowed me to send more dangerous criminals to prison. \n \nEven probation for pot was wasteful. Curfews and reporting requirements should be for prowlers and burglars, not pot smokers. \n \nThis problem persists, as 620,000 Americans were arrested for pot last year. Yes, illegal marijuana creates jobs for probation officers, prosecutors, bailiffs, chemists, clerical staff and many more; however taxpayers get soaked. \n \nCalifornia and three other states legalized marijuana on Nov. 8. Voters were persuaded by the Colorado experience, where $2.4 billion in revenues and 17,000 jobs were created in legalization\u2019s first year. Some of this boom comes from visiting Texans. \n \nThe Denver Post polled, \u201cWould you repeal legalization?\u201d The answer; \u201cNo\u201d, by a 51 percent to 36 percent margin. Gallup\u2019s 2016 poll showed support for legalization has grown to 60 percent nationally, and recent studies demonstrate no increased use among youngsters since legalization. Colorado is booming, and other states want what they\u2019re smoking. \n \nThe old \u201cReefer Madness\u201d arguments against marijuana have been dispelled. Today\u2019s legalization opponents such as Insys Therapeutics, which develops synthetic painkillers, poured $500,000 into the \u201cNo\u201d vote in Arizona. It\u2019s these legal painkillers which cause so much addiction and harm. \n \nPrescription drugs increase our health costs and Big Pharma doesn\u2019t want competition. The Catholic Church was also a huge contributor, with the Boston Archdiocese donating $850,000 to oppose Massachusetts\u2019 marijuana initiative. \n \nOne lingering anti-pot argument is that people will ingest and drive. This happens anyway and it will be illegal everywhere. \n \nNot satisfied, opponents wonder how they will test for marijuana. Field tests still work, but how about we just arm each officer with a chocolate bar, and they could cuff the stoned drivers as they grab for it. \n \nLegalization will come eventually, as it\u2019s only the oldest age groups who are opposed. \n \nAn estimated 15 million Americans use marijuana regularly, and about half our population has admitted trying marijuana. \n \nMarijuana decriminalization bills for the 2017 Texas Legislature, have been filed, including one by El Paso\u2019s own Joe Moody. \n \nRepublicans are increasingly in favor, because of the fiscal benefits and individual freedom arguments. Democrats are already there, and almost everyone wants to decrease the power of the violent drug cartels who smuggle pot across our border. \n \nLet\u2019s legalize it, and have Mexico put up the wall to keep Texans from trafficking marijuana into their country. \n \nEl Paso attorney Steve Fischer has been a professor of criminology and a Texas State Bar director.

It is great that all of the young players showed what they can do in games like this and also winning which is important for getting the confidence because it is not easy. We are only playing in the Premier League and the FA Cup so it is not easy to have minutes in this team but it was good that a lot of them could have minutes in this game and show the manager what can happen if he needs them.\u2019 \n \nFabregas pointed out that the team could have done better in certain aspects against the Championship side but that is why such games are so beneficial for fine tuning the squad, and there was no danger of complacency from the Premier League leaders. If memories of defeat against Bradford who were similarly 2-0 down at the Bridge in the same round two years ago were not enough, other cup upsets this weekend were a clear message. \n \n\u2018It is better to learn from other teams\u2019 mistakes like what happened to Liverpool and we saw that,\u2019 said Fabregas . \u2018It is a big lesson before you go onto the pitch that you have to give 100 per cent. There were a lot of different faces for this game but a professional job. We did well, we gave it all and we are pleased.\u2019 \n \nNext up it is our turn to take on Liverpool. \n \n\u2018We have three days to prepare well and I am sure the manager and the team will do the best we can to prepare for what I hope will be a fantastic game and a win for us.\u2019   \n ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Arsenal news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: EPL - Chelsea news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: Premier League news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Fabregas: Different faces do well","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Chelsea FC","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169685439","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"457"},"name":"Chelsea FC","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.chelseafc.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197809074","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In particular, there are fears the UK\u2019s much-vaunted move to \u201cthe front of the queue\u201d for a deal with the Trump administration will see inexperienced officials overwhelmed by tougher US counterparts.Critics also think the salary is a waste of money for the first two years of the five-year contract because the UK will be unable to reach agreements until the terms of divorce from the EU are finalised in 2019.Headhunter Russell Reynolds Associates is leading the search for the Department for International Trade\u2019s chief trade negotiation adviser. The company says that even more than £160,000 \u201cmay be available for an exceptional candidate\u201d. Theresa May is paid just over £150,000 a year, while international trade secretary Liam Fox and other cabinet ministers are paid nearly £142,500. Angus MacNeil, who chairs the House of Commons international trade select committee, says a lack of domestic expertise means this and other senior negotiator roles will have to be filled by overseas candidates.He adds: \u201cIt is indicative of the fact the UK is desperately thinking \u2018What now? What next?\u2019 that it is paying top dollar. People complained about a Brussels bureaucracy, but this is probably going to end up being doubled in a Westminster and Whitehall bureaucracy just to replicate that work.\u201dLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron says: \u201cAppointing a trade envoy on £160,000, who will be paid more than the prime minister, who cannot actually do their job for two years, shows how frankly stupid this government is being over Brexit.\u201d James McGrory, co-executive director of Open Britain, says: \u201cThe country desperately needs trade negotiators, but they\u2019ve got to do a lot more than sit around while Liam Fox twiddles his thumbs for two years unable to start negotiations.\u201dA Whitehall source insisted the salary reflected the \u201cextensive experience\u201d needed for the role.

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Ipswich Satellite","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662719","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"Ipswich Satellite","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thesatellite.com.au","publisher":"APN Holdings NZ Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197813759","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

EST January 28, 2017 \n   \nHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport  (Photo: WXIA) \n    \nATLANTA -- A local immigration attorney says at least four people, all legal residents who live in the Atlanta area, were detained for more than 5 hours at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, Saturday. \n \nNow Rep. Hank Johnson is saying that number could be higher than 10 on Saturday alone. \n \nAmong those who were stopped on their trip home were a family of three, including a 10-year-old child, and a grandmother who is not related to the other detainees.  Hours later - after 7 p.m. - the family was released to go home. \n \nToo emotional to speak on camera, they said they wanted to get their 10-year-old daughter home. \n \nBrother-in-law Mansour Kenareh said the Suwanee family was in good spirits but frustrated. \n \nA spokesperson tells 11Alive that, of the detained travelers 11Alive originally reported on, all of them were from Iran but legal residents of Georgia. They were returning from vacation in Iran on a flight from Amsterdam when they were detained around 12:30 p.m. Neither airport nor federal officials have confirmed these reports as of Saturday afternoon. \n \nThe detainment reports come amidst others around the country following a crackdown on immigration by the newly seated Trump administration. The President\u2019s executive action temporarily bans citizens from 7 Muslim-majority nations from entering the US.  Immigration activists say that includes green card holders. \n \n\"If you had come in at 4 yesterday afternoon you would not have this problem,\" Immigration Attorney Sarah Owings said. \n \nOwings said the travelers she had learned of were visiting family in Iran when they ran into issues returning to America while at Hartsfield-Jackson. \n \n\"Based on this executive action which was very hasty - very last minute - it was not something that was discussed by the legal community,\" Owings said. \"Or even the agencies that are impacted by this because they don\u2019t actually know what they\u2019re doing or how to do it.\" \n \nKenareh said his in-laws have been in the US for a little more than a year. The father is in the process of opening a business locally.  Kenareh hopes the issue is resolved soon. \n \n\"I don't blame the  people who are doing their job,\" he said. \"I give them credit, they are confused.\" \n \nUSA TODAY reports that  about 50 people were detained at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport , according to Alia Salem, executive director for DFW Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Families have been waiting at Terminal D in anticipation of meeting relatives who been held up in U.S Customs. A representative with CAIR met with families waiting for relatives. Some of them have been waiting for several hours. \n \nMeanwhile at Philadelphia International Airport,  two Syrian families, described as Christians, were briefly detained Saturday after arriving from Qatar and sent back three hours later. The families included two brothers, their wives and two children, according to a family member form Allentown, Pa., NBC10 reported . \n \nMohammed Al Rawi, chief information officer for Los Angeles County, said on Facebook that his father was removed from a flight in Qatar as a direct result of the order. \n \nIn addition to protests planned at airports around the country, there is also one planned for Hartsfield-Jackson in response to the executive orders. \n \n(© 2017 WXIA)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US immigration news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"As many as 11 detained at Hartsfield-Jackson following Trump immigration ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Richland","zipCode":"29209","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Columbia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WLTX","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169720601","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"22"},"name":"WLTX","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wltx.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/01/28/trump-refugee-ban-blocks-7-migrants-boarding-ny-bound-plane-cairo/97181446/","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand"],"sequenceId":"695197815358","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:21Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They refused to lift new product because they could no longer afford to run the business at a loss. \n \nThe IPMAN Chairman in the South-West, Mr. Debo Ahmed, lamented that private depot owners were selling the product at an exorbitant price. \n \nHe said, \u201cThe result of this is that about 90 per cent of our members who can no longer continue with the business, have already stopped lifting fuel while the remaining 10 per cent have threatened to also close down their stations if nothing was done to remedy the situation this (last) week. \n \n\u201cUnfortunately, we cannot sell above the pump price of N145 per litre in the South-West if we don\u2019t want to incur the wrath of the Department of Petroleum Resources. \n \n\u201cOur colleagues in the North, South-East and South-South are running their own businesses because they are selling above the pump price.\u201d \n \nAhmed urged the Federal Government to fully deregulate the petroleum sector so that individuals could buy and sell the product at a price considerate enough to keep everyone in business. \n \nSimilarly, another executive of the association, told Punch that his members bought fuel at N145 from private depots in Apapa, Ejigbo, and Oghara. \n \nHe said, \u201cWe decided not to cause panic by not openly announcing our intention to stop lifting fuel. The people will start feeling the effect as from Monday if the government fails to do anything about it. \n \n\u201cWe have held series of meetings with the owners of private depots to reduce their price but they refused, claiming that it would affect their business too. \n \n\u201cI am still running some of my stations because I have my own trucks. I bought fuel at N143 per litre at a private depot in Apapa and would transport a litre with N6 to Akure and other towns. This means I am running at a loss because I have to sell at N145, being the official pump price. I am doing this just to keep the stations running. I usually load eight trucks. But I load just two now.\u201d \n \nThe IPMAN Chairman, Ore Depot branch, Mr. Shina Amao, who confirmed the development claimed the problem was as a result of non-functional state of NNPC-owned depots where the product could be bought at N133.38k. \n \nHe said, \u201cGovernment should, without further delay, resume the pumping of fuel to the NNPC-owned depots in Ore, Ibadan (Mosimi), Ejigbo and Warri so that we can buy at the official landing cost of N133.28k as against the N145 per litre at the private depots.\u201d \n \nTop Stories","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ameh Comrade Godwin"},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Marketing news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Fuel scarcity looms in South West as independent marketers threaten to stop lifting fuel","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Post Nigeria","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"594932946","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"12443"},"name":"Daily Post Nigeria","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://dailypost.ng"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197818084","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:09Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn1.dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fuel-scarcity-Nigeria-TVCNews.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

These reforms include: \nMake the role of the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD), as the development arm of the AUC, more prominent, distinct and better defined along-side the roles of the various Commissions. Of equal importance is how consultation is improved on issues with member states through the Permanent Representatives Committee (PRC); \n \nForge stronger integration between AUC and regional bodies to ensure regular information sharing and conducting activities in a more efficient and cost effective manner; \n \nRe-introduce activity reports at annual summits to brief members on the work of the AUC on the period preceding that summit; \n \nEnsure attendance of regional summits and visits by the AUC as a matter of regular occurrence, and \n \nFollow up on implementation of the Kigali summit on funding to speed up process; and assess other mechanisms available to the Commission to generate income for the Union including discussions with the private sector. \n \nCommented Dr. Venson-Moitoi, \u201cThe African Union is uniquely positioned to contribute to laying the foundations for realising Africa\u2019s bright future and to achieve the Vision 2063 goals. This is not an easy task, though.

Previous studies compared only one of these alternative sediment routing methods with the default method. The proposed study evaluated the impacts of all four alternative sediment transport methods on sediment predictions: the modified Bagnold equation, the Kodoatie equation, the Molinas and Wu equation, and the Yang equation. The Arroyo Colorado Watershed, Texas, USA, was first calibrated for daily flow. The sediment parameters were then calibrated to monthly sediment loads, using each of the four sediment routing equations. An automatic calibration tool\u2014Integrated Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Analysis Tool (IPEAT)\u2014was used to fit model parameters. The four sediment routing equations yielded substantially different sediment sources and sinks. The Yang equation performed best, followed by Kodoatie, Bagnold, and Molinas and Wu equations, according to greater model goodness-of-fit (represented by higher Nash\u2013Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient and percent bias closer to 0) as well as lower model uncertainty (represented by inclusion of observed data within 95% confidence interval). Since the default method (Bagnold) does not guarantee the best results, modelers should carefully evaluate the selection of alternative methods before conducting relevant studies or engineering projects.

Submit it here or Tweet him at @hoynsie. \n \nHey, Hoynsie: Has the front office indicated if 2017 will be the year for a big attendance boom at Progressive Field? - Nick Walsh, Cleveland. \n \nHey, Nick: I think that will depend on the fans rather than the front office. I'm sure the Indians organization is working toward that goal after winning the pennant and reaching Game 7 of the World Series, but here's the catch -- they sell the tickets and the fans buy them. \n \nOwner Paul Dolan said Friday after  MLB awarded the Indians the 2019 All-Star Game that season ticket sales have increased from about 8,500 last year to an estimated 11,000 this year. So that's a start. \n \nHey, Hoynsie: I'm happy to see that the Indians are honoring Frank Robinson this season with a statue. For many years I was puzzled by the fact that the franchise did not acknowledge Robinson or its role in hiring the first black manager in the big leagues. The Indians should be proud of this distinction as they rightfully are about signing Larry Doby, the first black player to appear in the American League. Do you know if Robinson plans to attend the unveiling? - Ken Krizner, Wickliffe. \n \nHey, Ken: I never got the impression that the Indians downplayed the importance of hiring Robinson as the game's first black manager. They named him to their Hall of Fame last year and I think he's always been respected by the organization. The Indians are expecting Robinson to attend the unveiling on May 27. \n \nHey, Hoynsie: Do you believe the Indians will move if the attendance problems continue, particularly with the lease ending in 2023 and Progressive Field being 30 years old by then? I noticed from looking at old records that even when they were contenders in the mid-1950s attendance was low. Only in the late 1940s, early 1950s and 1990s was attendance good. - Richard Lyman, Caldwell, Idaho. \n \nHey, Richard: Attendance is always going to be a concern. But with the Indians reaching Game 7 of the World Series last year, owner Paul Dolan taking on a limited partner in John Sherman, Progressive Field in its third year of renovations and MLB awarding the Indians the 2019 All-Star Game, it's hard to imagine the team being on a more solid footing in Cleveland. \n \nHey, Hoynsie: What are  Edwin Encarnacion's stats at Progressive Field? - Barry Elliot. \n \nHey, Barry: Encarnacion is a .275 (25-for-91) career hitter with two homers and 11 RBI in 22 games. \n \nHey, Hoynsie: I refuse to accept the results of the World Series. When spring training starts, I'll be protesting, picketing and forming support groups. Contact me at #notmyworldseries. - AZCardman, Gilbert, Ariz. \n \nHey, AZCarman : In the name of Keith Olbermann, \"resist.\" \n \nHey, Hoynsie: Assuming Cleveland's goal is a world championship, having half of its power at DH (Edwin Encarnacion and Carlos Santana) seems to a significant disadvantage. I really think they need Mike Napoli back so they can play Santana in left field. It would also give them protection if Michael Brantley isn't at 100 percent. - Gordon Weller, Evansville, Ind. \n \nHey, Gordon: Having half their power at DH and first base (Mike Napoli and Santana) didn't seem to hurt the Indians last year.  As for Santana in left field, no disrespect intended, I'd rather see him at first base. \n \nHey, Hoynsie: Does Abraham Almonte have a minor league option left?

Ms Assafiri had planned to fly to New York in March to an international conference on the status of women. \n\nBut she has decided not to go, which she says is \"100 per cent\" due to the ban and unease at how authorities might act towards her. \"They can take you without notice, they can deem you whatever; there's absolutely no process, no human rights, everything's been scaled back. It's a scary, scary ... it's a war, that's been declared on people. It's ridiculous.\"\n\nQantas has said it will offer refunds to any passengers caught up in the immigration freeze. \"Passengers booked on Qantas for travel to the United States who use a passport from Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Libya have a number of options, including a change to their destination or a refund,\" the airline said in a statement.\n\nA spokesman for Jetstar, which flies to Honolulu, said no passengers were known to be affected, but the airline was \"finalising what we will do in the event that we do have passengers that are impacted\". A spokesman for Virgin Australia said the airline would offer refunds for those affected, but wasn't aware of any passengers in that situation.\n\nMs Assafiri, who has been outspoken on Muslims' and women's rights, said: \"It's a fear of unknown, that anything can happen to me; they can take me away because they are suspicious of my political activism and there would be no redress or recourse. It's an environment that's quite scary.\" \n\nThe chef and owner of the Moroccan Soup Bar in North Fitzroy and the Moroccan Deli-cacy cafe in Brunswick, also lashed out at what she regards as President Trump's tyranny and bigotry. \n\nIn a self-described \"rant\" on the cafe's Facebook page, Ms Assafiri said she was: \"Angry, in this new world order: I hereby declare, I will antagonise any public discourse which is grounded in bigotry and hate.... \n\n\"I will not bow down to injustice no matter it's manifestation. I will not give over my freedoms without a fight. I am nasty enough to misbehave....\n\n\"You can waterboard me, deny me, you can't change me.\n\n\"Only way to engage me is with respect.\"\n\nMs Assafiri told The Age she knew Muslims in the US, and spoke of \"their fear of leaving, their fear of staying, and how to juggle and straddle that duality when the entire government has this agenda. It's bizarre.\"\n\nMuslim writer Yassmin Abdel-Magied told The Age the ban would prevent her from going to a US multicultural conference in Wisconsin in March and was afraid it would be extended, halting future speaking tours. \n\nMs Abdel-Magied, born in Sudan and based in Perth, posted on her Facebook page: \"Looks like I'm banned from a visa to the USA for the next few months at least.\n\n\"Their loss... and awkward for the people who've booked me for speaking gigs! \n\n\"Sorry, I can't come cos they think I might be a terrorist!\n\n\"In all seriousness though, #1930s are back.\"\n\nShe noted: \"The irony of course being that no one from the banned countries has carried out a fatal attack on the US.\"\n\nAbdel-Magied, a mechanical engineer and campaigner for diversity, last year released her autobiography, Yassmin's Story: Who Do You Think I Am? \n\nIraqi refugee Waleed\u200b Alkhazrajy\u200b said the ban meant he wouldn't be able to attend the funeral in late February or early March of his uncle Majid, who died recently aged 85 in tPennsylvania. \n\nDr Alkhazrajy, 49, an anaesthetist who lives in Adelaide, and previously lived in Melbourne, fled to Australia by boat in 1996. He is an Australian citizen, but has been unable to renounce his Iraqi citizenship.\n\nHe has another uncle, Karim, who lives in Atlanta, Georgia, and he fears that if the ban is extended he may never see this uncle, nor seven cousins who live in the US, as well as his wife's relatives.\n\nHe described the ban as \"appalling\" and ignorant of the human toll. \n\nHe said it would cause families to be split. He likened it to Saddam Hussein's deporting and excluding of Iranians, \"regardless of their current citizenship or nationality\".\n\n\"There is no evidence that it will bring security [for the US] or save lives or really make a change,\" he said. \"It only affects normal people with their normal lives.\"\n\nWith AAP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Carolyn Webb"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Prominent Melbourne Muslim irate at Trump US visa ...","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4000","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Brisbane Adelaide Street","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Brisbane Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658354","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"191"},"name":"Brisbane Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fvictoria%2Fprominent-melbourne-muslim-rails-at-trump-us-visa-ban-20170129-gu0sw1.html&title=US+visa+ban+is+tyranny%2C+bigotry%2C+says+prominent+Melbourne+Muslim","https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fvictoria%2Fprominent-melbourne-muslim-rails-at-trump-us-visa-ban-20170129-gu0sw1.html&text=US+visa+ban+is+tyranny%2C+bigotry%2C+says+prominent+Melbourne+Muslim&via=brisbanetimes","https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fvictoria%2Fprominent-melbourne-muslim-rails-at-trump-us-visa-ban-20170129-gu0sw1.html&title=US+visa+ban+is+tyranny%2C+bigotry%2C+says+prominent+Melbourne+Muslim","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fvictoria%2Fprominent-melbourne-muslim-rails-at-trump-us-visa-ban-20170129-gu0sw1.html&title=US+visa+ban+is+tyranny%2C+bigotry%2C+says+prominent+Melbourne+Muslim&sou","http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fvictoria%2Fprominent-melbourne-muslim-rails-at-trump-us-visa-ban-20170129-gu0sw1.html&title=US+visa+ban+is+tyranny%2C+bigotry%2C+says+prominent+Melbourne+Muslim","https://www.facebook.com/melbexpress","https://twitter.com/melbexpress","http://www.facebook.com/brisbanetimes","https://twitter.com/brisbanetimes"],"sequenceId":"695197822710","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T19:34:02Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/content/dam/images/g/u/0/t/a/g/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gu0sw1.png/1485675243261.jpg"}],"video":[]}}
