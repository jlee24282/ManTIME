The trooper observed the odor of alcoholic beverage emanating from within the passenger compartment of the vehicle. Mr. Cerny was requested to perform Standardized Field Sobriety Tests, which he did and subsequently failed. He also submitted to a Pre-Breath Test screening which yielded a positive result for the presence of alcohol. \n \nMr. Cerny was arrested for DWI and transported back to the State Police barracks in Fonda.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n\nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n\n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n\n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n\n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n\nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n\nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n\nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n\nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n\nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n\nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n\nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n\nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \nReleased under special circumstances \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n\nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n\n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n\nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n\nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n\nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n\nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n\n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n'The executive order is unlawful' \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n\nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n\n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n\nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n\n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n\nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n\nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n\n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n\nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \nLegality questioned \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n\nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n\n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n\nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n\nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n\n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n\n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"DHS complies with judge to limit 'Muslim ban'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Missoula","zipCode":"59802","state":"Montana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Missoula","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KECI.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169687287","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"11"},"name":"KECI.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nbcmontana.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196970782","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://static.lakana.com/bmg-global-us-east-1/photo/2016/04/06/Homeland%20Security%20banner_31538218_2870103_ver1.0.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

At New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, some of the 2,000 demonstrators there chanted \"Let them in, let them in!\" \n \nLarge protests took place at the main airports for Washington, Chicago, Minneapolis, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Dallas. \n \nDonnelly's decision to issue a temporary stay, which stopped short of ruling on the constitutionality of Trump's order, came after dozens of people were detained at US airports following Trump's actions. \n \nThe exact number of those affected is unclear, but the judge ordered the government to provide lists of all those detained at US airports since the measure went into effect. \n \nSending those travelers back to their home countries following Mr Trump's order exposes them to \"substantial and irreparable injury,\" wrote Donnelly, who was appointed by Mr Trump's Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. \n  \n\n  \nProtesters angry over Mr Trump's executive order temporarily banning refugees and travellers from seven countries. (AFP) \n \nA second federal judge in Virginia also issued a temporary order restricting immigration authorities for seven days from deporting legal permanent residents detained at Dulles Airport just outside Washington, according to US media. \n \n\"We knew that was coming, we were prepared,\" said Camille Mackler, a lawyer who heads legal initiatives at the New York Immigration Coalition, one of the groups that quickly mounted the demonstration there. \n \n\"But we didn't know when, and we couldn't believe it would be immediate, that there'd be people in an airplane the moment the order was taking effect.\" \n \nThe List Project, which helps Iraqis whose personal safety is threatened because they have worked for the United States, expressed outraged over the move, warning it put American lives at risk too. \n \n\"I can't say this in blunt-enough terms: you can't screw over the people that risked their lives and bled for this country without consequences,\" wrote the project's founder and director Kirk Johnson. \n \nThe ACLU's legal challenge sought the release of two Iraqi men on grounds of unlawful detention. One of them, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who has worked as interpreter and in other roles for the US in Iraq, was in fact released today after being detained the day before. \n \nDemocratic Representative Jerrold Nadler, who went to JFK to press for the release of those detained under Trump's measure, said \"We must fight this executive order in the streets, in the courts, anywhere, anytime. We must resist. We must fight.\" \n \nMr Trump's pronouncement on Muslim immigration makes good on one of his most controversial campaign promises to subject travelers from Islamic countries to \"extreme vetting\", which he declared would make America safe from \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nThe targeted countries are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n \nDonnelly's decision shows that \"when President Trump enacts laws or executive orders that are unconstitutional, and illegal, the courts are there to defend everyone's rights,\" ACLU executive director Anthony Romero said in leaving the emergency hearing. \n  \n\n  \nProtesters at JFK. (AFP) \n \nThe ban has triggered political backlash, including from Mr Trump's fellow Republicans. \n \nOrrin Hatch, the most senior Republican in the US Senate, spoke of America's \"legal and moral obligations to help the innocent victims of these terrible conflicts.\" \n \n\"I strongly urge the new administration to move quickly to tailor its policy on visa issuance as narrowly as possible, delivering on our security needs while reducing unnecessary burdens on the vast majority of visa-seekers that present a promise - not a threat - to our nation,\" he said in a statement. \n \nConnecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, wrote: \"To my colleagues: don't ever again lecture me on American moral leadership if you chose to be silent today.\" \n \nHis tweet was accompanied by the now iconic photograph of Aylan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian boy whose body washed up on a beach in Turkey in 2015 after a failed attempt to flee Syria's brutal war to join relatives in Canada. \n \nThe rapid mobilization against the order suggests a protracted battle is shaping up between migrant advocates and Trump and his administration. \n \n\"This is the opening salvo of a long battle that will go on in the courts,\" said Michael Kagan, a law professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas who specializes in immigration issues. \n \nHe said the outcome of the legal battle is unclear because \"we are in unchartered territory in modern America.\" \n \nThe battle could end up in the US Supreme Court, which has not ruled on this type of immigration issue since the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. \n \nA White House official said that holders of a green card, which allows permanent residence in the US and often takes years to obtain, who are abroad should first go to the US consulate to obtain a document allowing return to the US. \n \nAnd green card holders in the US who want to travel abroad must obtain approval from a consulate official. \n \nThe State Department has said that people from the seven countries under the 90-day travel ban will be prohibited entry no matter their visa status.

The \"sanitised\" report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). \n\nThe report, whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986. \n\nThe very first sentence of the report's available (undeleted) page reads: \"Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\" It, however, later clearly said that \"assassination is the major near-term threat\" to him. \n\nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991. \n\nThe first section titled \"Key Judgments\" analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India's relations with the US, the then USSR and the region. \n\nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi's life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder. \n\n\"If Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures - including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India - were taken by the Indian President ......(deleted),\" it said. \n\nInterestingly, it also names P V Narasimha Rao and V P Singh, who could be the \"interim successor\" and \"likely candidates\" in case of sudden exit by Rajiv. Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991. \n\nIn a section, titled 'The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy', the report says \"In our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\" besides \"a fanatical Hindu\". \n\nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis. However, another section deals in- depth with Rajiv's mediation efforts to resolve \"the conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo...\" (More) Besides Gandhi's possible assassination, the report also \n\nanalysed various scenarios of his \"abrupt departure\" from the political scene before 1989. \n\n\"Although we believe assassination is the major near-term threat to Rajiv's tenure, any of several other events could cause his abrupt departure from the political scene before 1989,\" it said while listing out several other possibilities including \"his death from natural causes or by accident\". \n\nIt ruled out the possibility of a decision by him \"to resign out of frustration\", saying \"we see no signs of this and believe it would be out of character\". \n\nThe CIA report also noted: \"We suspect, however, that Rajiv would calculate -- as we do -- that he and his kin would be targets for extremist violence even if he left public office.\" \n\nIn a section called \"Implications for the United States\", the report says \"We believe (Rajiv) Gandhi's death would represent a significant blow to US interests, regardless of the circumstances of the succession.\" \n\n\"...We believe Indo-US relations could also suffer as a result of domestic political changes following Rajiv's assassination.\" \n\nThe report assessed Rajiv's policies ranging from dealing with extremists, foreign relations (including Sri Lankan Tamil issue) to promoting acquisition of selected foreign technology\" among others, and their outcome. \n\n\"Although some of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's policies will continue to encounter serious resistance over the next several years, we believe his dominance of the Indian political scene is secure until at least the end of his present term of office in December 1989, barring his incapacitation or death,\" it said. \n\nThe report also dealt with the possibility of a \"national government\" taking over in case of a sudden exit by Rajiv, while discounting the possibility of a military coup in such a scenario. \n\nSeveral portions of the 23-page report were deleted before the CIA decided to release it under the Freedom of Information Act.   \n Continue FREE with Ads  Pay Rs. 1 to Read Without Ads","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sri Lanka news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"}],"title":"'CIA Assessed Rajiv Gandhi Assassination 5 Years Before He Was Killed'","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Outlook India","feed":{"genre":"Press Release","tags":[],"id":"169659229","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"28"},"name":"Outlook India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News","Wires"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.outlookindia.com","publisher":"Outlook Publishing (India) Private Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196972238","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2320","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Maitland","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Maitland Mercury","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169745285","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Maitland Mercury","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.maitlandmercury.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196975064","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council.

Juan Francisco del Canizo, a Universidad Complutense de Madrid researcher, said: \"Knowing how to mix the biological components, in what conditions to work with them so that the cells don't deteriorate and how to correctly deposit the product is critical to the system.\"\n\nThe process for producing these tissues can be carried out in two ways: To produce allogeneic skin from a stock of cells, done on a large scale, for industrial processes; and to create autologous skin, which is made case by case from the patient's own cells, for therapeutic use, such as in the treatment of severe burns.\n\n\"We use only human cells and components to produce skin that is bioactive and can generate its own human collagen, thereby avoiding the use of the animal collagen that is found in other methods,\" the researchers noted.\n\nThis method of bioprinting allows skin to be generated in a standardised, automated way and the process is less expensive than manual production.\n\n--IANS\n\nsku/sm/vt","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"IANS India Private Limited"},"topics":[],"title":"Now print human skin with this 3D bioprinter","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Yahoo!

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 9 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hinds","zipCode":"39209","state":"Mississippi","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jackson","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"16 WAPT","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681288","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"173"},"name":"16 WAPT","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wapt.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196982308","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Pete Ricketts and Ken Stinson. Her donor list also includes several Omaha construction and development-related companies. \n \nStothert said her $1.5 million fundraising total since the 2013 election exceeds her campaign\u2019s budget for the entire election. But she said she\u2019s not going to stop fundraising. \n \n\u201cI think it shows a lot of support, and I\u2019m very grateful for the people that donated to my campaign,\u201d she said. \n \nMello said he expects to spend about $1 million overall. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go still in this campaign, and we\u2019re working hard every single day to expand our support,\u201d he said. \n \nOf the money he\u2019s raised, almost $190,000 was carried over from his legislative campaign committee. \n \nMello said his support from the business community is an endorsement of his leadership style, saying donors are drawn to his consensus-building. \n \nBut Stothert said Mello\u2019s donors are simply an indication that she\u2019s had to say no to people \u2014 even potential donors \u2014 during her four years in office. \n \nAdkins, the political science professor, noted that there are still several months to go before the May 9 election. \n \nMello\u2019s business support \u201cdemonstrates that there is some interest in the business community in seeing a change in the mayor,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cHow much of an interest there is, we\u2019re still going to have to see. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at the point yet where we really know that.\u201d \n \nAdkins said donors don\u2019t like to give money to those who don\u2019t have a chance to win, so Mello\u2019s fundraising shows that donors believe he\u2019s a quality challenger. \n \nThe fundraising totals are good for Stothert too, Adkins said. He said it\u2019s a good sign for her that she\u2019s amassed a war chest of more than $890,000. \n \n\u201cIf an incumbent can raise a lot of money and they don\u2019t have to spend it, that\u2019s a pretty good sign,\u201d he said. \n \nThe campaigns\u2019 2016 year-end reports are due to be made public Tuesday, but the campaigns provided their figures to The World-Herald last week. Stothert filed her report Saturday. \n \nStothert\u2019s report includes all of her donations for the past year. \n \nDuring 2016, Mello ended his legislative campaign committee and formed a new committee for mayoral election fundraising. \n \nMany of Mello\u2019s top donors last year were Republican business leaders who have had high-profile clashes with Stothert. \n \nHe received $25,000 each from Omaha Performing Arts Chairman John Gottschalk and local businessman Dana Bradford. \n \nThere are no limits on the amount of campaign contributions in Nebraska state and local political races. \n \nBradford, executive chairman of Waitt Brands, declined to say why he donated to Mello. \n \nGottschalk, a former publisher of The World-Herald, said it\u2019s a contested election and he thinks Mello deserves support. \n \n\u201cAll the money is essentially to put him in a position where he\u2019d be competitive,\u201d Gottschalk said. \n \nHe declined to elaborate or say why he preferred Mello over Stothert. \n \nOther big-name businessman donors to Mello include Mike Yanney, who gave $16,000 and is the co-finance chair of the campaign, and Mike Cassling, who gave $5,000. \n \nA handful of donors gave to both, including Walter Scott, chairman emeritus of Peter Kiewit Sons\u2019 Inc., and Rod Yates and Frank Krejci, who are behind the potential redevelopment of Crossroads Mall. \n \nIn a statement, Yanney said he decided to support Mello to bring a new leadership style to City Hall. \n \nHe said Mello is \u201ca proven leader who has built consensus to pass balanced budgets and landmark legislation around economic development initiatives and public-private partnerships in the Nebraska Legislature.\u201d \n \nYanney, founder and chairman emeritus of the Burlington Capital Group, had previously donated to Mello\u2019s legislative campaigns. He did not return a phone message last week. \n \nMello said he attributes the support to \u201cour record of tackling big issues in the Legislature and helping make significant progress on economic development and public-private partnerships. That\u2019s given my candidacy much more broad appeal than people realize.\u201d \n \nStothert, though, attributed that support to the fact that she had denied requests from many of those business leaders. \n \nIn particular, regarding Gottschalk, Bradford, Cassling and Yanney, Stothert said she\u2019s had to make \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d and tell them no. \n \n\u201cWhen I made those decisions it was always in the best interest of the Omaha taxpayers,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the price of leadership.\u201d \n \nParticular disputes include: \n \n» Gottschalk was the chairman of OPA last year when the performing arts group asked the city to acquire three buildings near the Holland Performing Arts Center. That land would go to the arts group for future expansion, and the group would turn over a nearby parking lot to HDR Inc. for the company to build a new downtown headquarters. \n \nStothert agreed to direct the city to buy the buildings. But she declined to tear down the century-old buildings in order to make room for the expansion, which would have been unpopular with preservation groups and others. \n \nThe arts group backed out of its request for the buildings, and the deal to bring HDR downtown eventually fell apart. The company\u2019s headquarters will be in Aksarben Village instead. \n \n» Bradford served as the chairman of the Metropolitan Entertainment and Convention Authority, a nonprofit that oversees the city-owned CenturyLink Center and TD Ameritrade Park. Stothert was highly critical of MECA under Bradford\u2019s tenure, saying the group needed to release more information to the city about the facilities\u2019 operations. (Bradford gave Stothert\u2019s campaign $5,000 in 2013 after she took office.) \n \n» Cassling is a former top donor to Stothert, giving her $33,000 between 2012 and 2014. He heads an initiative to bring a multisport complex to the Omaha area. The facility was initially planned to be located in Tranquility Park. That deal fell apart, at least partly, Stothert said, because the group asked for $20 million in city money. The group pulled out of Omaha and later decided to build in La Vista. Cassling, who also serves on the OPA board, did not return a phone message last week. \n \n» Yanney\u2019s daughter, Lisa Roskens, is involved in the multisport project. Yanney and his wife, Gail, also led a campaign to raise money for what is now the Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center. As a council member, Stothert voted against a 3 percent tax on tobacco sales across the city to help fund the center, but the City Council ultimately approved the tax. \n \nStothert said she\u2019s received donations from well-known Democrats, including developer Jay Noddle and restaurateur Willy Theisen, both MECA board members, as well as John Kotouc, executive chairman of American National Bank. \n \nNoddle gave $10,000, according to her report, Kotouc gave $5,000, and Theisen gave $2,500. \n \nShe also received a $2,500 contribution from David Slosburg, another board member of OPA. \n \nMello said Kotouc gave his campaign $1,000 this month, which is after the deadline for this campaign finance report. \n \nAbout Mello\u2019s Republican donors, Stothert said: \u201cSome people aren\u2019t used to being told no. It\u2019s much easier to say yes. I still think the right answer was no in these cases. If they\u2019re angry about it, so be it.\u201d \n \nSaid Mello: \u201cI\u2019m the leading challenger who has a vision for the city, running against a mayor with no vision.\u201d \n \nroseann.moring@owh.com , 402-444-1","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Local government news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Omaha's Stothert-Mello mayoral race looks to be competitive, costly","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Buchanan","zipCode":"64501","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Saint Joseph","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"St. Joseph News-Press","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"177152785","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1044"},"name":"St. Joseph News-Press","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newspressnow.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196982483","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/newspressnow.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/06/706126a8-c7cb-5b2f-b170-db3170199c79/588d96a98b67d.image.jpg?resize=300%2C452"}],"video":[]}}

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n \n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n \n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n \nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n \n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n \n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\" \n \n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"SG","country":"Singapore"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Channel NewsAsia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662733","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"142"},"name":"Channel NewsAsia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.channelnewsasia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196982684","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And all would be subject to a 20 percent import tax proposed by the Trump administration last week as a means of paying for a border wall between the two nations. \n \nLike many in both countries, however, Jacobo wasn\u2019t quite sure how taxing imported goods to be sold to his U.S. consumers would add up to making Mexico and Mexican consumers pay for the wall, a campaign promise of President Donald Trump. \n \nRather than burdening Mexico, Jacobo said, such a tax collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials would end up being passed on to wholesalers in the United States, then to U.S. retailers and ultimately to his consumers. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s like any other price increase,\u201d said Jacobo, whose parents started the family grocery store 40 years ago. \u201cYou have to pass it on to the customer, or what\u2019s the point of being here?\u201d \n \nThe White House said last week that a 20 percent border tax on imports from Mexico is one method the Trump administration is considering to equalize a $60 billion trade deficit and to pay for a barrier between the two nations to control the entry of illegal immigrants, drugs and guns. \n \nA White House spokesman refused to detail exactly how taxing goods coming into the country \u2014 taxes surely to be passed on to U.S. consumers in the form of higher retail prices \u2014 would generate revenue from Mexico\u2019s government or consumers for the construction of a wall. \n \nSean Spicer, the spokesman, later appeared to backtrack, telling reporters that the tax was \u201cone idea\u201d to pay for the wall and that his intent was not to \u201croll out\u201d a new policy. Not all Republicans seemed to be on board, either: U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., posted on Twitter that \u201cTariffs are a tax on American families.\u201d Colleague Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called talk of an import tax \u201cmucho sad.\u201d \n \nSome economists last week also were scratching their heads at the idea. They included University of Nebraska at Omaha economist and professor Christopher Decker. \n \n\u201cUnless I\u2019m missing something, I\u2019m not quite sure how that works,\u201d Decker said. \u201cIf imports dry up as a result of the increase in tax, you\u2019re not going to have a lot of tax revenue.\u201d \n \nOn the other hand, if imports from Mexico remain high because consumers are willing to pay higher prices for valued goods, the people paying those higher prices are U.S. consumers. Instead of Mexico paying for the wall, Decker said, Americans who buy Mexican-made goods would be paying for the wall. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s backwards,\u201d Decker said. \u201cThat confounds me a little bit.\u201d \n \nIt\u2019s not just foodstuffs that are affected \u2014 many automobiles, some under American nameplates such as Chevrolet and Dodge \u2014 are assembled in Mexico. Presumably they also would be slapped with a 20 percent import tax as they made their way into the U.S \u2014 if automakers didn\u2019t find somewhere else to make the cars. \n \nThere apparently is some hope that threat of a tariff, or tax, on imports to the U.S. from Mexico could spur carmakers to bring some production back to the U.S. \n \nDennis Williams, president of the United Auto Workers, generally expressed support for Trump\u2019s idea of tariffs on Mexican imports, according to news reports after the November election. \n \nSuch support was in short supply among agricultural interests in the Midlands: Farmers and others connected to the ag industry said they had much to lose if talk of an import tax ignited a full-on trade war. \n \nMexico is Nebraska\u2019s second-largest trading partner, after Canada, with $1.2 billion in trade in 2015, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. \n \nMidlands ag folks were crystal clear Friday when they said they do not favor any U.S. trade policy that will lead Mexico to retaliate with punitive border levies of its own that might cut deeply into the ability of Nebraska and Iowa farmers to sell their grain profitably south of the border. \n \n\u201cAny disruption of export markets would result in continued downward pressure on farm incomes and farm financial health,\u201d said Steve Nelson, president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau. \n \n\u201cAgriculture exports account for roughly one-third of farm income,\u201d Nelson said, \u201cmaking trade critical to agriculture. Any actions jeopardizing Nebraska\u2019s ability to access international markets is of great concern to our members.\u201d \n \nThe leading categories are the usual suspects: processed food and grain. Mexico is the third-largest consumer of all U.S. agriculture goods, the second-largest consumer of U.S. corn, third of U.S. soybeans and fourth of U.S. beef. Nebraska, in turn, ranks in the top five nationally in the production of each, as does Iowa in corn and soybeans. \n \nMajor corporations with a stake in Mexico are monitoring the situation closely. In Omaha, that means Union Pacific Railroad, employer of 8,000 in Nebraska. The second-largest freight railroad in the United States, about 11 percent of U.P.\u2019s volume is tied to Mexico. The company serves all six of the rail crossings between the United States and Mexico. \n \n\u201cA big chunk is vehicles and vehicle parts going back and forth,\u201d Union Pacific marketing chief Beth Whited said in a conference call with analysts and investors this month. \n \nDaniel Sherman, a Wall Street transportation-industry analyst for St. Louis-based wealth adviser Edward Jones, said he doesn\u2019t see any long-term threat to Union Pacific from the Mexican standoff because, politics and rhetoric aside, there are people on both sides of the border with their heads on straight. And that means, Sherman said, a long-term agreement wherein both sides prosper because it is not in anyone\u2019s best interest for anything but. \n \n\u201cI see the current dust-up as the start of a long drawn-out negotiation process that likely ends better than it will look in the middle,\u201d Sherman said in an interview. \u201cThe reason it ends better is because both sides realize that each is benefiting in a major way from the trade between our two countries.\u201d \n \nOn the same conference call earlier this month, U.P. Chief Executive Lance Fritz said the economies of the two countries are inextricably tied. \n \n\u201cIt is our perception that the United States is tightly woven with our trading partners,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cOur consumers benefit greatly from free and open trade.\u201d \n \nSuch \u201cfree and open trade\u201d is generally considered to be that in which neither trading partner levies import taxes at the border, fees known as tariffs. Fritz said free trade benefits the United States by allowing imports of goods that can be produced more cheaply overseas than domestically. \n \nFree trade advocates say it also opens up exports, encouraging technological and productivity advances in U.S. manufacturing, and the concomitant job growth. \n \nThe opposite trading philosophy is known as \u201cprotectionism,\u201d in which hefty tariffs are levied at the border to make imported goods more expensive than those manufactured domestically, a strategy designed to protect domestic agriculture, industries and jobs from foreign competition. \n \nFor the Midwest, it is the ag portion that resounds the loudest. Corn is selling for less than half the $8 a bushel record seen in 2012, farm debt is up and land prices are declining. \n \n\u201cMexico has been an important and growing market for raw and processed agricultural goods,\u201d said John Campbell of Omaha investment bank Ocean Park Advisers, whose work includes commodities analysis. \u201cA trade war with them when farmers are already in a fragile financial situation would be disastrous for rural America.\u201d \n \nBack in South Omaha, Tony Vega\u2019s Plaza Latina at 4938 S. 24th St. carries a wide range of goods, including Mexican-made cowboy boots costing up to $850 a pair. Customers will balk at a 20 percent increase and may bargain down the price, cutting into the store\u2019s earnings. \n \nThe tax option is another negative message from the Trump administration, said Vega, who helps local people with travel plans and finding doctors or lawyers in Omaha. There\u2019s a fear that the federal government will track down people who aren\u2019t legal residents. \n \n\u201cThe most important thing is we want to be the best citizens we can be, respect the law, respect everything,\u201d Vega said. \u201cWe must be good neighbors. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d \n \nr ussell.hubbard@owh.com , 402-444-3133 \n \njordan@owh.com , 402-444-1080 \n Mexico is a big U.S. trading partner  \nMexico is our third-largest goods trading partner with $531 billion in total (two-way) goods trade during 2015, the last year with statistics available through the Office of the United States Trade Representative. \n Exports: $236 Billion  \nMexico is the United States\u2019 second-largest export partner, and it ranks third in U.S. agricultural products received at $18 billion. \n \nTop export categories (in billions) \n \n1.

his first week in power punching out at critics dishing up \"alternative facts\" polarizing public opinion and making good on an electoral promise to shake up Washington \n\nOne week into the Trump era and there is a serious case of political whiplash in America's capital Just a week ago an outsider who never before held elected office rode into town Seven days later norms and doctrine that have guided the United States for decades are being re-examined Trump's down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address a call to arms that tested old distinctions between left and right\n\n\"Today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another\"he said\n\n\"We are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you the people\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump's down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address a call to arms for the era of \"America first\"\n\nThe establishment \"elites\" in big cities in politics and the media were no longer the technocrats in charge of the world's only superpower they were the enemy\n\nThe new president also put the rest of the world on notice\n\nFor the last 75 years America had been what Barack Obama described as the \"indispensable nation\" -- the glue that bound the global order\n\nThe era of Trump would be the era of \"America first\" he said of naked self-interest and zero-sum diplomacy Old alliances would be reassessed new alliances would be explored\n\nBefore his inauguration many asked if the presidency would change Donald Trump or whether Donald Trump would change the presidency\n\nBarely 20 minutes into his four-year term anyone who was listening had their answer Keeping Trump's campaign promises Before arriving at the Oval Office Trump's strategists had decided to use the first few weeks to unleash a daily wave of executive orders\n\nThe aim was to unbalance opponents define Trump as a man of action and slake his supporters' thirst for change\n\nFor much of middle America globalization automation and the Great Recession had been apocalyptic\n\nPolitics had passed them over and worse they felt steamrollered by \"coastal elites\" in America's \"culture wars\" over abortion gay rights immigration global warming and religion\n\nTrump had won the election by promising to be their champion and he was going to -- as Ronald Reagan said -- \"dance with the one that brung ya\"\n\nFor the most part the CEO-in-chief put forward actions that could have come from any Republican in the country defunding abortion preening the military and approving oil pipelines\n\nBut it was coated with a thick veneer of nationalist and populist rhetoric and accompanying policies championed by top aide Steve Bannon\n\nTrump ripped up a trans-Pacific trade deal designed to counterbalance China's regional economic power imposed a ban on refugees from Syria and migrants from seven other Muslim countries\n\nHe ordered planning to begin to build a wall on Mexico's southern border and picked a very public fight with Mexico's president Enrique Pena Nieto who cancelled a trip to Washington\n\nThe United States a nation founded by migrants was now willing to shut its doors Not since Obama's election or perhaps the Iraq War has America's image around the world changed so dramatically and so quickly\n\nBut Trump supporters saw an outsider sticking up for them and sticking it to the elites\n\n\"Get used to it\" said Trump aide Kellyanne Conway boasting that Trump had delivered a \"shock to the system\" \"And he's just getting started\" she said\n\n- Rocky start -\n\nBut it was not all positive for Trump The White House is far from purring Key positions have yet to be filled and the decision making process is haphazard\n\nTrump aides were forced to publicly row back suggestions of a 20 percent border tax on Mexican goods and defend a chaotic rollout of the refugee and migrant ban\n\nThroughout the week Trump engaged in intemperate outbursts about the size of his inaugural crowd alleged election fraud and perceived media persecution\n\nPrivately in call after call he complained to top aides about press coverage The impression was of a man focused on his image more than running the country\n\nTrump also seemed like a a man for whom becoming US president was not adulation enough\n\nSpokesman Sean Spicer -- between tirades and missteps -- offered a window onto the soul of the White House \"There's this constant theme to undercut the enormous support he has\" Spicer said \"It's unbelievably frustrating when you're continually told it's not big enough it's not good enough You can't win\" According to a Quinnipiac poll Trump's approval rating at the end of his first week stood at 36 percent\n\nBut critics saw a more sinister motive for the outbursts particularly Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that three million people voted illegally in the election\n\nBrian Klaas an expert on global democracy at the London School of Economics sees Trump \"casting aspersions without evidence on electoral integrity is a key way to restrict voting rights and erode confidence in elections\"\n\n\"Attacking the media and blurring the lines of truth with state narratives not grounded in fact is important to sowing public doubt\" he said\n\nMindy Finn who ran as a independent vice presidential candidate summed up Trump's strategy as \"sow chaos deepen division and consolidate power\"\n\nFor his harshest critics the question is now whether Donald Trump breaks the presidency or whether the presidency breaks Donald Trump","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Suffolk","zipCode":"11795","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"West Islip","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"West Islip Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169671077","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"West Islip Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.westislip.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695196991778","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:53:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22877259/20170128/091105/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1485654598-9499.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Their proposal idea was to run a positive mental health awareness week in our school community.Hence H.O.P.E. (Heroes of Positive Engagement) was born. Each morning, a positive praise of hope will be read over the intercom in different languages used in the Coláiste. The aim is to face into the day on a positive note. Tesco will be sponsoring free fruit, our art students have made a symbolic \"pillar of strength\" to raise a sense of hope. We are delighted that \u2018H.O.P.E\u2019 week is being launched by Finbar Walsh from the Donal Walsh Foundation. Donal was a real voice of hope speaking with sincerity and realness about his illness, mental health issues, suicide and ways of supporting others in our communities around the country. Finbar has continued to make his voice of hope heard and will speak to all our students Monday. We are delighted to have Oonagh Hogan from Aware speak to our senior students on Tuesday and Wednesday. Aware have a ' Beat the Blues' campaign designed specifically for secondary schools. \n \nAs well as speakers during H.O.P.E week we are delighted to have some fun lunchtime and after school activities. A \u2018Wish Gig\u2019 hosted by former students will be in the gym lunch time Monday, followed by a \u2018Clear Your Head Walk\u2019 after school. Tuesday has an acoustic gig in the oratory after school, hosted by present students. There's also a free yoga session open to staff/ students. Senior students will also lead the juniors with a fun \u2018Dreolín\u2019 in the junior social area. Wednesday has the Aware talks continuing throughout the day. Free hot chocolate will be available during the 11 o clock break. Many thanks to Darren for this. After school on Wednesday a free mindfulness session led by Edel McCormack will take place. The focus of the session is to look at techniques on how to reduce stress and anxiety. Friday is a \u2018Bright Colours Day\u2019, a free non-uniform day where staff and students will wear their brightest colours. Friday also marks a physical fun day, led by the PE Dept. and volunteers. We aim to finish HOPE on a positive note. On Friday all classes will be visited by the local B.O.P group (Bubbles of Positivity). They are a local young person\u2019s positive mental health group. Their first initiative was to bake cookies for the LC students when they finished their Christmas exams.

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n   \nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n   \nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \n   \nFAIRFAX, VIRGINIA \n   \nDozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. \n   \nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. \n   \nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n   \nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday. \n   \nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n   \nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n   \nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n   \nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" \n   \nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n   \nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition. \n   \nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n   \nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \n   \nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n   \n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n   \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n   \n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n   \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n   \n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" \n   \nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. \n   \nPORTLAND, OREGON \n   \nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\" \n   \nLOS ANGELES \n   \nAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night.

How do I get started? \n \nAnswer: There's no uniform definition of a ''tiny house,'' though most experts say it's a home that has 400 square feet or fewer of living space. It's estimated that there are only about 10,000 of them across the U.S., many of them owned by either empty-nester retirees or younger millennials who want to keep their housing costs low while they struggle to pay off their student-loan debt. \n \nThere certainly are several benefits to living small. You'll not only downsize or eliminate a mortgage but also save on utility and related costs. You'll also leave behind a smaller ''carbon footprint'' on Earth. And if your tiny house is built on a trailer, as many are, you can move or travel as often as you wish without going through the hassle of selling or renting your home to do it. \n \nOf course, there are downsides, too. Besides living in relatively cramped quarters, you may find yourself with a brand-new list of regular chores, such as buying fuel for a gas heater, making frequent trips to the laundromat or emptying a composting toilet. \n \nEntertaining more than one or two guests at a time may be difficult or impossible. And, if the home is on a trailer, you may have to move more often than you'd like in order to avoid problems with police or traffic-enforcement officers. \n \nIf you're serious about building a tiny house, you'll first need to find out if they're allowed under your city or county's zoning ordinances. Many municipalities set minimum square-footage requirements or have tough building codes that make construction of the pint-sized homes impossible within their geographic boundaries. Some, though, make exceptions if they'll be placed on a parcel that also has a larger house on it. \n \nAssuming that you don't have much construction experience, you may need to hire an architect and professional contractor to build the house. A money-saving option, though, would be to buy one of the small kit homes that are readily available from many websites for as little as $5,000. All of the pre-cut wood and other basic parts of the home will be shipped to you in large crates, which can then be assembled in much the same way that children build a home with plastic Lego bricks or the popular Lincoln Logs wooden toy sets. \n \nPerhaps the most authoritative source for folks who want more information is the Florida-based American Tiny House Association (www.americantinyhouseassociation.org). One of the better books on the issue is the second edition of Dan S. Louche's ''Tiny House Design & Construction Guide,'' which still can be purchased for about $25 at many bookstores or from websites like amazon.com and bookdepository.com. \n \nReal estate trivia: Spur, Texas (pop. 1,400), declared itself ''Tiny House Capital of America'' in 2014 after local officials voted to end nearly all of its size-related building requirements. \n \nDear Mr. Myers: If my wife and I put the title to our home into the type of simple living trust that you recently wrote about, would we have to notify our future heirs? And after we die, would the contents of the trust become available for public inspection? \n \nAnswer: The answer to both of your questions is ''no'' and this helps to highlight an often-overlooked benefit that an inexpensive, easy-to-form living trust can provide. \n \nMost homeowners who create a living trust do so because they want to avoid the costly and time-consuming probate process. Nearly all wills must pass through probate, but trusts almost never have to: Instead, the trust's property typically can be distributed quickly to heirs with little or no involvement by a judge or pricey attorneys. \n \nYour letter, though, raises another important issue that separates a will from a trust. A will usually becomes part of the public record the moment it goes to Probate Court, which means it can be viewed by virtually anyone after you die. But because a living trust is a private document that doesn't have to go through the court system, its assets won't automatically be put on display for the prying eyes of nosy neighbors or sue-happy relatives. \n \nSend mail to D.

The Braves will have a year-round presence with a sports rehabilitation and training academy that could bring 70 employees to North Port. \n \nBoth in Arizona and Florida, new communities have been built with spring training as a community magnet. But does baseball really help sell houses? West Villages did its market research and held focus groups, asking local residents what they would like to see in a community. \n \n\u201cNot just spring training, but a whole host of items,\u201d Black said. \u201cPart of what has been primary in our discussions as a private developer is the need for this facility to not be just about spring training. It needs to create synergies with the State College of Florida, with the University of Florida\u2019s Innovation Station (engineering program) on the state college campus and opportunities for partnering with Sarasota Memorial and its health care complex in West Villages. \n \n\u201cSo we looked at those synergies as critical, and one of the most significant parts is the Braves bringing their sports rehabilitation and player development activities for their entire network of teams to the West Villages. This is not just about bringing 17 games of baseball in the spring. We want year-round activities that we could leverage to other opportunities.\u201d \n \nThis will further enhance the region\u2019s reputation in a new business segment. \n \n\u201cWith IMG in the Bradenton market, with the spring training facilities we have (in Bradenton, Sarasota and Port Charlotte), with the rowing facilities at Benderson Park and one the county is doing on the Myakka River on River Road, and now the Braves\u2019 academy here as well, we have created a corridor around sports tourism and medicine that you don\u2019t have anywhere else,\u201d Black said. \n \nThe Braves also will run fantasy baseball camps for youths and adults at the West Villages facility and host tournament play \u201cat all levels,\u201d Black said. Outside the 6,500-seat baseball stadium, the $75 million facility will have a plaza and performance venue that can be used for farmer\u2019s markets and concerts. \n \nHaving a blank slate helped the project, which Black envisions as \u201can intergenerational destination focused on an active lifestyle.\" \n \n\u201cOne of the reasons we ended up on this site \u2014 we have 10,000 acres and looked at a variety of locations \u2014 is because it has very little environmental constraints on it. It is a pasture, a hay field with cows grazing on it,\u201d Black said. \u201cIt makes it one of the most efficient and easiest that we could identify from a permitting and design aspect. \n \n\u201cThe other aspect was, we wanted the facility to be close to the schools and the state college. We saw the opportunity to share uses with the potential high school and state college.\u201d \n \nWest Villages is donating the land for the facility, with good reason, Black said. \n \n\u201cWe are building a new town. As part of that, you have houses, you have shopping, you have a downtown,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as we have provided a site for elementary and middle schools to the school board and working with the Catholic Church on a new site for them in the West Villages, there are opportunities that come with having that public recreation and entertainment venue. \n \n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t get the Braves, would we have been disappointed? Yes. But we would have turned to other things that would have created opportunities for that public engagement, outdoor recreation and entertainment to come with it.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Harold Bubil Real estate editor @haroldbubil"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: MLB - Atlanta Braves news","group":"Sports Teams"}],"title":"BUBIL: Braves will boost the market","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Charlotte","zipCode":"33952","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Port Charlotte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southwest Florida Herald Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169670275","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"793"},"name":"Southwest Florida Herald Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197003459","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

President Trump has identified tax reform as one of his top priorities, and legislation is expected to move quickly in the new Congress. \n \nIn a tax-deferred exchange, owners can postpone recognition of gains on investment real estate when they swap one property for another of \"like kind.\" The capital gains tax that would otherwise be due gets deferred until the owner sells the replacement property and receives cash. \n \nUnder Section 1031, which has been part of the tax code since 1921, a rental house in Santa Barbara, California, might be exchanged for an investment duplex in suburban Chicago. Oklahoma farmland could be exchanged for rental condos in Washington, D.C., Boston or Miami. Exchanges are also used to further environmental protection objectives, such as through swaps involving conservation easements to preserve habitat and prevent future development. \n \nTo qualify for tax deferral, exchanges must follow a detailed set of IRS rules specifying the timing for identifying replacement properties and transaction closing deadlines. An entire industry of \"qualified intermediaries\" exists to facilitate exchanges by escrowing proceeds and administering transactions to comply with IRS rules. \n \nFixer-upper houses and other real estate held for short periods and then flipped to new buyers do not qualify for tax-deferred exchanges, nor do owner-occupied residences. \n \nLosing the ability to use an exchange would be a significant blow to \"Mom and Pop\" and other small-scale realty investors. According to a study posted on the website of the National Rental Home Council, there were 15.7 million rental homes in the U.S. as of 2015, and 99 percent of them were owned by non-institutional investors. A study by professors at the University of Florida and Syracuse University estimated that most exchanges involve relatively small properties; in 2011, 59 percent had a sale price of less than $1 million. \n \nBill Horan of Realty Exchange Corp. in Gainesville, Virginia, told me about recent transactions that illustrate some of the objectives of tax-deferred property swaps. In one, a rental property owner exchanged it for two Dollar General stores. The owner \"didn't want to be a daily landlord anymore,\" which involved hands-on management duties and liabilities, Horan said. By rolling his rental housing gains and equity into \"triple net\" leased retail properties, where the tenants essentially are responsible for everything, he was able to simplify his life, diversify his portfolio and potentially make greater gains in the future with retail real estate. \n \nAnother small investor swapped a rental home in Virginia for a rental condo in Fort Myers, where he intends to move for retirement. \"He wanted to own property near where he's going to live,\" said Horan. Since the Fort Myers unit cost $412,000 and the rental home he relinquished was valued at $525,000, the investor ended up paying a modest amount of capital-gains taxes. \n \nExchanges have been on congressional tax writers' hit lists before, in part because they generate tax \"expenditures\" \u2014 losses of otherwise immediately collectible revenue for the federal government. In December 2015, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that during fiscal 2017, exchanges would generate tax expenditures of $11.7 billion attributable to corporations and $6 billion attributable to individual taxpayers. For the same year, by comparison, revenue losses caused by deductions for mortgage interest and local property taxes by individual homeowners were much larger \u2014 $84.3 billion and $36.9 billion, respectively. \n \nExchange proponents, such as Suzanne Baker of Investment Property Exchange Services in Chicago, argue that most of the deferred taxes ultimately are collected when properties get sold for cash and that exchanges stimulate economic activity \u2014 redevelopment and upgrades of properties for example \u2014 that would not occur if owners faced immediate taxes on their gains and therefore simply sat on them. \n \nBottom line: If you own investment real estate and have contemplated a Section 1031 exchange, beware: There's a significant possibility that tax reform could knock your plans off track. Keep a close eye on what's happening, because it could happen fast. \n \nKen Harney's email address is kenharney@earthlink.net.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Real estate news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Tax news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Real estate investors may lose important tax tool","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Charlotte","zipCode":"33952","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Port Charlotte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southwest Florida Herald Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169670275","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"793"},"name":"Southwest Florida Herald Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197004179","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But the architecture that often has the biggest impact on a community \u2014 found in public places and spaces \u2014 comes at a relatively little cost to those who use it. \n \nWhen was the last time you went to the new Sarasota County beach pavilions at Siesta, Caspersen, Lido or Manasota beaches and thought to yourself, \u201cMy, they spent a lot of my tax dollars on these buildings\u201d? \n \nInstead, beachgoers just use the pavilions and may not even notice the design. But architects and civic project managers strive not to be wasteful, and there is pressure on the designers to make sure their work \u2014 the people\u2019s architecture \u2014 serves the public good. \n \nThe importance of public architecture is the topic of an exhibit open through March 10 at the Center for Architecture Sarasota\u2019s McCulloch Pavilion, at 265 S. Orange Ave. \u201cArchitecture in the Public Realm,\u201d an exhibit of posters and models of public projects by local architects, is open from noon to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays and noon to 2 p.m. Saturdays. \n \nThe program also will include lectures by architect Guy Peterson and landscape architect David Young on Feb. 1; architects Sam Holladay, Dale Parks and Joe Farrell on Feb. 8; and Julian Norman-Webb and Gary Hoyt, with landscape architect Jessica Heinz, on Feb. 22. Admission to the events is free. \n \nJust as it is for most public architecture. Rich or poor, nearly everyone is served by these buildings \u2014 even tourists who have paid no taxes toward their construction. The buildings must be all things to all users and do it with a style that reflects the aesthetic values of the community. \nThe 20:20 catalyst \nThe \u201cArchitecture in the Public Realm\u201d program was developed in response to the Bayfront 20:20 project, in which a citizen\u2019s committee is exploring ways to make the most of 42 city-owned acres around Sarasota\u2019s Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall. An exhibit and lecture on the topic were one of the best-attended events in CFAS history. \n \n\u201cThere are a lot of great public works done by architects in this community,\u201d said Martin Gold, director of the University of Florida\u2019s CityLab Sarasota, which shares the McCulloch Pavilion with CFAS and is one of the organizers of \u201cArchitecture in the Public Realm.\u201d \n \n\u201cOne of CFAS\u2019 core missions is to bring the diversity of architects together. This is an outreach effort to get everyone to send us public projects and let\u2019s talk about them,\u201d Gold said. \n \nSuccesses of those structures can inform the Bayfront 20:20 committee, Gold said. \u201cThey will have to make a lot of decisions. Can we facilitate community engagement in the public realm as an important investment? The city owns the land, so for it to be done well, it will require a lot of civic and public support. We are hoping to be part of that part of the equation.\u201d \n \nThe CFAS exhibit spotlights such local public buildings as the recently built county beach pavilions designed by Sweet Sparkman Architects, the Palm Avenue Parking Garage and the security barrier at Sarasota High School\u2019s Building 4 by Solstice Architects, the Sarasota County Bus Transfer facility and the G. Wiz renovation by architect Dale Parks, and the to-be-built South Florida Museum by Fawley Bryant Architecture. \n \nAt recent architect lectures in the series, Gold discussed his \u201cArcher Braid,\u201d a 10-mile-long pedestrian/bicycle path that twists, turns and roughly parallels Archer Road in Gainesville. Carl Abbott described the Summerhouse Restaurant and St. Thomas More Church projects, and Todd Sweet told the story of the county beach pavilions. \nThe public's investment \n\u201cThe public has an investment in and participates in the process\u201d of designing community buildings, Gold said. \u201cSweet Sparkman had workshops and charrettes, with people explaining what their needs were, and those guys did an outstanding job translating that into great public space that we can be proud of.\u201d \n \nThe buildings have brought people to our beaches, he said. \"The balance of tourism and the economy is a tough one, but if we bring more people to the beaches, everyone does better in the community. \n \n\u201cIt is an extension of the respect that the beaches belong to the public,\u201d Gold added, noting that much of the coastline has limited access except at the large public beaches. \u201cYou can\u2019t own the beach. The beach is a public infrastructure and we do need everybody to have the best access they can get.\u201d \n \nAt his recent lecture, architect Sweet said the pavilions were planned when the economy was in the Great Recession and builders were hungry for work. So was his young firm, which, until that point, was known for the Courthouse Center building at Main Street and U.S. 301 but was mostly being hired to build carports. \n \nSweet said he wouldn\u2019t stop pestering the county for some kind of design commission. \u201cTo shut us up, they gave us some bathrooms\u201d \n \nFortunately for Sweet Sparkman, they found they had a friend in John McCarthy, who was then director of Parks and Recreation for Sarasota County. McCarthy is also known as a local historian and an enthusiastic booster of Sarasota\u2019s architectural heritage and community. \n \n\u201cWe have a strong history of public park and beach architecture that John McCarthy was very familiar with,\u201d Sweet said. \u201cHe wanted iconic beach restrooms, where tourists and citizens could identify those buildings as county buildings, to show that we care about the architecture we put out there. \n \n\u201cWe were a young firm and had nothing to lose. There was a lot of young energy, and McCarthy was excited about it. He was able to convince people at the county that this is what we wanted to do. We came to the next meeting and presented something like this.\u201d \n \nHe held up a photograph of one of his beach pavilions, with the distinctive vertical rods forming a sort of curtain around the access ramp. \n \n\u201cWe looked at each site looking for things that (could inform) the architecture of the buildings,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenge was how to take a restroom building, with a ramp that could take up more space than the restroom, and make it look like one cohesive structure.\u201d \n \nThe result was the \u201cabstract concept of sea oats\u201d that was \u201cvery coastal.\u201d \nCommunity identity \n\u201cIt is not a prosaic sort of architecture,\u201d architect and historian Joe King told the Herald-Tribune in 2013. \u201cWhen it is done well, it helps you in the transition from ordinary life to enjoying the sand and the Gulf of Mexico. These buildings are about community identity, too. They are variations on a theme, and are all about county branding.\u201d \n \nThe successful beach pavilions project \u2014 four of the five designs have been built \u2014 has led Sweet Sparkman to other important projects, including the new Venice Library and the Basch Center at Ringling College. \n \n\u201cAnd we are probably still doing some carports,\u201d Sweet said. \n \nHe noted a big difference between public architecture and private architecture: The clients. \n \n\u201cPublic projects today are so scrutinized because of the tax spending,\u201d Sweet said. \u201cThere is a much more thorough selection process and meetings along the way. On the Venice Library, there were 20 public meetings to make sure that the public was informed and knew what was being spent and how it affected them as citizens. \n \n\u201cWith a public project, you are dealing with a project manager who is a county employee. They don\u2019t have the emotional ties to the project that you have with a private residence. A lot of times, (architect) Jerry Sparkman will play therapist because there is such emotion when you are designing somebody\u2019s house that you don\u2019t have when you are sitting across from a county project manager.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Harold Bubil Real estate editor @haroldbubil"},"topics":[{"name":"Architecture and design news","group":"Society"}],"title":"The people\u2019s architecture","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Charlotte","zipCode":"33952","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Port Charlotte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southwest Florida Herald Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169670275","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"793"},"name":"Southwest Florida Herald Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197004975","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The impact on victims can be measured, not in traumatized days and months, but in years and decades. The psychological impacts are multiplied by difficulties encountered keeping jobs and maintaining relationships. Often memories of such horrific assaults only surface years later, after countless hours of therapy and support. \n \nWe have also learned that rapes and sexual assaults are less likely to be perpetrated by strangers preying on strangers. It is much more likely, we now know, to be perpetrated by a family member in familiar surroundings or by a colleague in the workplace. \n \nAnd while rape remains egregiously underreported, we now know that efforts in recent decades to encourage reporting have brought more cases to the attention of the courts without the recriminations that were so often present in the past. As we have begun to take the impacts of sexual assault on victims and their families much more seriously, we are also seeing that the way police, prosecutors, court personnel, and medical professionals interact with victims of rape and sexual assault has been changing as well. \n \nOne thing that has not changed, however, is one of the most important threshold questions asked when someone comes forward: When did the attack take place? In New Hampshire, if a victim answers with any date before Jan. 29, 2011, the reporting officer might just as well stop writing, crumple up the form they were filling out and aim for the recycling bin. There is nothing that that officer or any prosecutor or judge in the state can do in such a situation. Because the alleged crime was committed over six years ago, no case can ever be brought against the accused perpetrator, thanks to our current statute of limitations. This law must be changed. That is why this year I have filed legislation (SB 98) to end New Hampshire's harmful and arbitrary six year statute of limitations for sexual assault claims. \n \nStatutes of limitations serve a purpose in property crimes. No one thinks that police should spend years tracking down a stolen car or investigating an act of vandalism. People file an insurance claim, purchase a new vehicle, and move on with their lives. Statutes of limitations also stop prosecutors from holding charges over a suspect\u2019s head for years without proof. There are hundreds of classes of criminal cases that don\u2019t merit remaining prosecutable for an indefinite period. Sexual assault and rape is not one of them. \n \nNationwide attention to the arbitrary nature of short statutes of limitations has recently received much greater public attention. Most notably, in the last year, as a result of claims leveled against Bill Cosby for rape and sexual assault going back forty years. A number of Cosby\u2019s alleged victims have come forward, in the wake of others speaking out, only to find themselves without legal recourse against the comedian due to such statutes of limitations. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, only two in 100 rapists will be convicted of a felony and spend any time in prison. The other 98 percent will never be punished for their crime. (Felony Defendants in Large Urban Counties, Dept. of Justice publications, 2009) \n \nCalifornia, undoubtedly in response to the Cosby case, has just recently joined a number of other states in seeking to remedy this egregious situation by passing legislation ending such statutes of limitations without opposition. It is time for New Hampshire to reform its laws as well. \n \nOnce armed with the ability to bring such cases long after the six-year limit, I am confident that prosecutors in our state will be able to put more rapists behind bars and stop sexual offenders, who are routinely discovered to be serial offenders, before they can reoffend. This means fewer rapes, fewer women \u2013 and men \u2013 being victimized, and fewer New Hampshire lives shattered by sexual violence. \n \nFor those wishing to support this effort, SB 98 and SB164 (companion legislation covering sexual crimes against minors) will have a hearing before the Judiciary Committee next Tuesday, January 31 at 9 a.m. in Senate Hearing Room 103 in the State House. The Judiciary Committee can also be reached at 271-3092. \n \nMartha Fuller Clark represents her hometown of Portsmouth as well as Durham, Lee, Madbury, Newfields, Newington, and Newmarket in the New Hampshire State Senate.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Martha Fuller Clark"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Crime and punishment news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Remove the statute of limitations on sex crimes","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rockingham","zipCode":"03801","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portsmouth","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Seacoast Online","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169678066","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2297"},"name":"Seacoast Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://seacoastonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197005393","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Full details are at www.newmarketschoolprojects.com. \n \nEfforts to modernize the high school date back a dozen years, and past failed efforts led to this plan, an honest, reasonable investment that takes into account the town\u2019s economic diversity. The $39 million plan is integrated to provide shared spaces such as a cafetorium in the high school and new gymnasium in the elementary school that are available for all district students. \n \nA homeowner with a house assessed at $250,000 would pay an additional $788 per year, or $66 a month. That is a considerable amount, but it\u2019s less than the previous plan, which only dealt with the high school, and it\u2019s likely to be less than any future plan should this one not be approved, especially as construction costs and interest rates rise. It is also less of a financial impact given the town\u2019s increased property tax base since 2014, which on April 1 will include the full taxable base of the redeveloped mills as it received a tax deferral as part of its redevelopment. \n \nIt is regretful that the New Hampshire Legislature has thus far failed to reinstate school building aid. Should lawmakers do the right thing this plan is designed to be eligible for some level reimbursement. \n \nSchool leaders respected that a town with the economic diversity of Newmarket cannot pass a wish-list plan. A cafetorium, which is a cafeteria with a stage and appropriate acoustics to provide a performance venue, instead of a much more costly auditorium, is a perfect example of the pragmatic design. No one can tell all residents they should vote for this plan if they have limited income, but the committee did consider all with a need-based plan. \n \nModernizing both schools will help increase property values. In time, while building upon Newmarket\u2019s renaissance, especially its vibrant downtown, property values will equalize with surrounding towns. This pragmatic modernization will limit the tax increase to what is truly necessary and that will also help increase property values. \n \nThere will be debate about the $39 million cost, which has been referred to as the elephant in the room, but most of 2014\u2019s divisiveness will be absent because it\u2019s not as hard to sell the merits of this plan. \n \nSome will ask how an early estimate of a $15 million to $18 million renovation of the junior-senior high school rose to $28.4 million. School officials say that estimate didn\u2019t create a real plan that provides a 50-year upgrade to the high school. This plan is not another Band-Aid, the collection of which has already cost residents millions of dollars. The high school plan will create 50,501 square feet for a total of 128,134 square feet. It preserves the original 1924 building and there is value in saving this piece of town history and culture. \n \nRenovation/expansion plans are common at Seacoast schools, including Portsmouth\u2019s high and middle schools, Winnacunnet High and Oyster River High. Those projects proved to be cost-effective and efficient. \n \nThe 2014 $45 million plan didn\u2019t address the elementary school while nearly maxing out the school\u2019s legal bonding capacity. This plan will modernize the elementary school, which now uses modular classrooms and doesn\u2019t have appropriate cafeteria or gym space.

And when you\u2019re going into one thinking it\u2019s \u201canother interview\u201d instead of \u201cThe Interview,\u201d you\u2019re unlikely to put your best foot forward. So what are some of the basics to remember no matter if it\u2019s your first interview or your tenth? \n \nDress the part: The first impression you make when you walk into an interview is visual. You want it to reflect your best self, so when you\u2019re getting dressed, you should feel like that. Yes, your clothes must fit well, be neat and clean. No, you may not need to wear a suit. Over-dressing is certainly better than under-dressing, but you want the hiring manager to be able to easily picture you in the role, so dress for it. Research the company culture and the position you\u2019re seeking and then take it up a notch. Take your outfit for a test run beforehand and see what happens to your shirt when you sit down and if your shoes are comfortable enough to walk in. Pulling on your clothes or constantly adjusting something that isn\u2019t comfortable will be distracting for you and your interview. \n \nListen: I think I put in a note about listening in everything I write, no matter what the topic. Why? Because it is essential. Listening starts before you even get in the room. Before your interview research the company \u2013 read their employee blogs and learn about the interviewer and the position. (And be sure to review your own resume, you\u2019d be surprised at how much you\u2019ve forgotten.) One of the skills your interviewer is looking for is good communication. So be sure to listen carefully. You\u2019ll get a lot of information and be able to engage with the interviewer more adeptly. Listening isn\u2019t just being quiet when the other person speaks. It means not spending that time thinking about what you\u2019re going to say next. Really listen to what is being said and you\u2019ll be able to confidently give the best, most thoughtful answers. \n \nTell your story: Part of your interview preparation is knowing what story you\u2019re going to tell. Instead of one word or one-sentence answers, tell a short, but clear, story. Focus on a theme that best suits the position and the question that was asked, whether it\u2019s about why you want the job, your leadership or your ability to work in a team. This is also an excellent way to work in relevant personal experiences. Practice your story beforehand \u2013 you can do it with a friend or even record yourself speaking. It\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll sit down in an interview and give the exact same speech about yourself, but it will be helpful to know how it sounds best. \n \nAsk questions: If you\u2019re in a first or second interview for a position, this is easy. When you\u2019re in your third, fourth or fifth, it takes more work and preparation. One candidate I know was in her last round of interviews for her dream job and had prepared everything but this. When the interviewer asked if she had any questions for him, she paused for a moment and asked, \u201cWhat are some questions I might not know to ask?\u201d hoping his answer would prompt her. What questions do you have?\u201d is a question you have to be prepared for. It not only gives you an opportunity to get answers you\u2019re seeking, but lets the interviewer know that you\u2019ve listened to what\u2019s been said, you\u2019ve thought about the job and that you\u2019re truly interested in the position. \n \nFollow up: What you wear to interviews has changed. Where they take place has changed. Maybe you\u2019ve had a virtual interview. But the \u201cthank you\u201d note has not. Send a note within 24 hours to everyone who was involved in your interview. Email is fine, but do remember that it\u2019s business correspondence and that it must be error-free and appropriately formatted. Read it out loud to yourself as you\u2019re more likely to catch typos that way. Keep the notes short and personalize them to each interviewer. You want to let them know you not only appreciated their time, but to remind them of why you\u2019re a good fit and that you took something meaningful away from the interview. \n \nMatt Nagler is managing partner, BANK W Staffing, Alexander Technology Group, KBW Financial Staffing & Recruiting, The Nagler Group, Sales Search Partners, which has a local office at Pease International Tradeport in Portsmouth.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Nagler"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Treat every interview like it\u2019s 'The Interview'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rockingham","zipCode":"03801","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portsmouth","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Seacoast Online","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169678066","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2297"},"name":"Seacoast Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://seacoastonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197006047","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

During the 2016 filing season, the IRS reported a 400 percent increase in tax-related scams. \n \nThe IRS continues to update its warnings to taxpayers about an ongoing telephone scam in which the caller claims to be an IRS agent tasked with collecting an unpaid tax liability. The caller demands immediate payment by gift card or iTunes card, both of which are more difficult to trace, and often threatens arrest if the taxpayer fails to comply. I have spoken to several taxpayers who received these calls, and have received them myself. I have also seen fake IRS messages come through via text making similar claims and enticing taxpayers to call a phone number provided to settle the matter. To avoid falling victim to these telephone and text message scams, keep in mind that the IRS will never contact you by phone or text regarding your tax account or filings. They will always send a notice through the old-fashioned U.S. mail. \n \nScammers have also used email to find victims and this approach may be growing. The IRS recently warned tax preparers regarding a two-part email scam comprised of an initial message supposedly from a taxpayer looking for assistance in preparing his tax return. If the preparer responds, a second email with either a web link or a PDF attachment with an embedded web link is sent under the guise of containing the taxpayer's tax documents. These links are designed to allow the scammer to collect information from the tax preparer that can be used to unlock other information the scammers can use for financial gain. \n \nAnother email scam targeting tax preparers is also circulating. In an effort to improve its e-services system, which is used by tax professionals to request tax transcripts and conduct other business with the IRS on a taxpayer's behalf, the IRS recently required all e-services users verify their identities. Notices were mailed to all e-services users that their accounts would be disabled if they did not take action within 30 days. Scammers have used this opportunity to send fraudulent emails which appear to be an important security-related communication from the IRS but actually contain a link to a bogus website that mimics the IRS' e-services registration page. \n \nBased on a message I received from a client last week, this scam may be targeting taxpayers as well. She had received an email that appeared to be from the IRS requesting that she verify her account information via a web link. This email was not legitimate. The IRS has a clear warning on its \"Get Transcript\" web page noting the IRS will never call, email or text a taxpayer asking for information or requesting that a taxpayer login to a website to update his or her account profile.  \n \nThe IRS also issued a warning about emails containing fake CP2000 notices. These notices are generated when information reported on a taxpayer's return does not match information the IRS received on W-2, 1099 and other tax-related reports. If additional tax is owed due to the discrepancy on the return, these notices also provide instructions for making a payment to the IRS. In addition to appearing legitimate, the fake notices are being sent both via email and postal mail. Emailed versions should be easy to identify as fake since the IRS will never use email to deliver them. \n \nThe IRS has also provided guidance regarding how to tell if a CP2000 notice is legitimate or a scam. The fake notices are issued from an Austin, Texas, address and the tax issue involved is related to the Affordable Care Act. The included payment voucher in the fake versions also lists a letter number 105C. To help taxpayers determine whether a notice received via mail is legitimate, the IRS recommends visiting their website at www.irs.gov/individuals/understanding-your-cp2000-notice where they provide an example of a real notice. \n \nDavid T.

This was presented in response to readers\u2019 inquiries requesting the clarification between invention and innovation. An invention solves a problem, while innovation studies the situation and tries to improve the performance. In a simpler expression, invention is a \u201cmaker\u201d while innovation is a \u201clistener.\u201d \n \nThe short series on TV news and its lack of innovation drew a surprising number of reader responses, all of which emphatically agreed with what the columns stated. Here are two examples: \n \n\u201cI am 76 and agree, your comments are right on.\u201d \u2013 George \n \n\u201cHello, I am in such complete agreement with your article about the weather forecast on TV news that I had to write! I am of the generation still watching network TV news and am often so frustrated when I've just watched the weather and still have no clue what the forecast is! \nWell said! Thank you!\u201d \u2013 Dianne Ahern \n \nInventions require excellent and insightful analysis of the problem at hand, while innovation requires deep understanding and careful listening of the silent voice of the market. \n \nAs the column stated last week, the vast population increase in the age 65 and older segment of this country necessitates that we as the nation must prepare now to take care of the issues that will rise. Unfortunately, we are starting much later than should have. All sorts of inventions and innovations should be encouraged to deal with this massive nation within our nation of 100 million people of age 65 and older. Are we ready? Not quite. \n \nInvention advice: Three weeks ago, I posted a notice that we will form a committee of volunteer experts from approximately 10 specialty fields. Our readers with invention ideas can submit their concepts to this column and the committee will make comments on the ideas. This column receives a significant number of such ideas from readers seeking advice and I felt we should encourage readers (who wish to invent) to freely request advice. \n \nIt turned out many more than 10 people sent in their willingness to assist this volunteer activity and some are highly qualified. I hadn\u2019t thought so many volunteers would respond. But, America still depends on new inventions to make wealth and promoting inventions is a right thing to do. \n \nOur first task is to come up with a NDS+A (non-disclosure agreement) to protect these volunteers from any frivolous lawsuits. Inventors are creative, but they are also emotional (I know it as I am one). They don\u2019t like to hear their idea isn\u2019t any good, or worry that their ides might be copied by someone in the volunteer committee. So this form will protect them. The form is being drawn up by a prominent intellectual attorney with the University of New Hampshire Law School. \n \nThe members of the first valuation committee are as follows in alphabetical order: Alessandro Levi-Montalcini: iPhone apps; Joseph Pont: Pharmacology, biopharmacology, green chemistry; Robert Stuart: Maritime sailing and on-board tools, piloting and navigation; Ann Tarlton: Botany, horticulture; Zed White: Contracting, house construction, wood tools; and one solar power expert who wishes to remain anonymous. \n \nI expect the committee to consist of 10 experts. The membership term is one year, and this term will start Feb. 1. \n \nHow to send in your invention? \n \nRequest our NDA forms (two) to be mailed to your home address. Please return two signed forms to American Invention Institute, P.O. Box 26, New Castle, NH 03854. Email a description of your concept to sasano@gmail.com. Our committee will start evaluating your idea. Their consensus will appear in subsequent columns. \n \nNote: It is important for inventors sending in their idea to know the committee\u2019s evaluation is simply limited to whether the idea works according the initial purpose of solving a problem. The committee does not deal with any issues related to patent and intellectual property issues or marketability issues. \n \nWrite your text of explanation as clearly as possible and draw your graphics as clearly and detailed as possible. We do not expect you to draw \u201cpatent\u201d drawings, but poorly drawn expressions would easily lead us to misunderstanding. \n \nOnce your idea is sent in, give us a month to formulate our reply. Our experts will work diligently and accurately express their opinion and I wish not to hurry them. Our review would start covering previous submissions first. We have a few ideas readers have sent in that haven\u2019t been reviewed. We will look at them first. \n \nShintaro \u201cSam\u201d Asano was named by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2011 as one of the 10 most influential inventors of the 20th century who improved our lives.

They also gave me the interest in doing what I\u2019m doing right now \u2014 writing. I was surprised at how sad I was to learn about Mr. Haggerty\u2019s passing. He wasn\u2019t part of my daily life. I had only seen him a handful of times since graduating. Yet, something about the news struck me. Over the years, I would stop into the little book store in North Hampton where Mr. Haggerty worked in his retirement and we\u2019d chat and catch up. He was always interested in what I was doing, what campaigns I was on, what my plans were. The fact he and I disagreed politically on almost everything never stopped the conversation from being pleasant and kind. It never stopped him from letting me know he was proud of what I was doing or had done. Mr. Haggerty didn\u2019t preach tolerance, he demonstrated it by accepting me for who I was and am. We could use some more Mr. Haggertys in the world today; maybe that\u2019s why I was so struck. \n \nSince President Trump took office just a bit more than a week ago, we have seen a Women\u2019s March and March for Life, celebrations and protests and all forms of disagreement in both social and traditional media. We have seen people preach tolerance while condemning those they disagree with. We saw acts of violence and vandalism and cowardly attacks on people who had presumably voted differently than the attacker. \n \nI worked in politics for a long time. Long enough to remember when following events or even debates, competing staffs would join each other afterward for a drink or a bite to eat. I remember Democrat and Republican lawmakers going out for dinner or lunch or after a session to talk about life outside of politics. People didn\u2019t hate each other based on voter registration. Moreover, people were able to exchange ideas, even disagreeing in an agreeable manner. There was a mutual respect for one another, even during the discussion of opposing opinions. \n \nWe are a nation of more than 300 million people. The idea that we would all agree \u2014 or that we even should \u2014 is as insane as smashing windows of Starbucks to spread tolerance. \n \nTolerance is not agreement. Quite the opposite. Tolerance means to accept the views, lives and opinions of others, without disliking them for it. It means, live and let live. Somewhere along our path, and certainly over the past two years, too many have forgotten this. \n \nI received several emails regarding last week\u2019s column, some in praise, others in disagreement. I was thrilled to be part of a dialogue even with those who didn\u2019t agree with me. I was so pleased people went out of their way to write to me and express their opinions. I learn from others' ideas and I don\u2019t shun them for having them. I celebrate the exchange of them. \n \nPeople in New Hampshire and America are all over the spectrum emotionally since the inauguration. Some are jumping with joy, others bitter and angry. Most are probably somewhere in between. Every one of the opinions and emotions are valid to the person feeling them. Why can\u2019t we embrace that reality and embrace our differences? How completely boring the nation would be if we were all the same. My stops in the little bookstore in North Hampton probably wouldn\u2019t have been as much fun either. \n \nRest well, Mr. Haggerty and thank you. Your lessons will live on in the too-many-to-count students you inspired. \n \nThat\u2019s my perspective; I\u2019d love to hear yours. You can write me your thoughts or ask me to weigh in on anything you\u2019d like and maybe your comments or topics will appear here next time.

Occasionally, while waiting in check-out lines, she would be drawn to the tabloids displayed there, with their garish headlines about celebrities, perversities, conspiracies and aliens with three breasts. \n \nEmbarrassed, I'd always ask her to put it away before people saw her looking at them. True to my recently acquired adolescent sophistication, I would patiently explain what rubbish it all was. Thankfully, she never actually bought one of them! \n \n\"Why? It's in print. It must be true. They can't print something that's not true.\u201d \n \n\u201cYes, Mummy, they can.\u201d \n \nNot only did they but, alarmingly, they still do. \n \nNot only do they still but in doing so those media outlets have empowered an intellectually-deprived portion of our citizenry with the courage to act out their anger and prejudices in shameful, unpatriotic and dangerous ways. \n \nToday, one of the more dangerous manifestations of that empowerment stands before us as president. \n \nToday, those outlets, exponentially multiplied in the internet age on diverse platforms, are sustained by true believers nurtured by Fox News, Breitbart and Stormfront. They\u2019re egged on by kleptocrats and oligarchs who\u2019re profiting from the resultant polluted tide of nativism and prejudice without calling to calm the roiled waters of bigotry. \n \nThis week, according to AP, at New York\u2019s JFK Airport \u201ca Massachusetts man was accused of attacking a Muslim Delta employee Rabeeya Khan, allegedly kicking and shouting obscenities at the woman and telling her that President Donald Trump \u2018will get rid of all of you.\u2019\u201d \n \nWhen Khan ran from her attacker he followed her, got down on his knees and began to bow down, imitating a Muslim praying, shouted more obscenities and said \u201cTrump is here now. He will get rid of all of you. You can ask Germany, Belgium and France about these kind of people. You see what happens.\u201d \n \nTo American Muslims this isn\u2019t news. This is merely one of well-over 400 Islamophobic acts directed at Muslims in the past 12 months and merely reflects the fear and uncertainty many American Muslims are experiencing. \n \nThis week such fears are being amplified by a report that Trump will soon announce a cessation to issuing visas to Iranians, Iraqis, Syrians, Libyans, Somalis, Sudanese and Yemenis. \n \nThis reported executive order \u2014 a deliberate act of religious exclusion \u2014 clearly places Donald Trump within that shameful pantheon of bigots occupied by the likes of Strom Thurmond, George Wallace and David Duke. \n \nAnd it will stand as an executive order contrary to reality, especially because all the terror attacks America\u2019s endured since, and including 9/11, not one was by a citizen or refugee from the above sanctioned seven countries. \n \nFirst, the reality is that much of the terrorism and political violence experienced in America is committed by white supremacists many of whom, it appears through intelligence reports, are forming connections with European right-wing extremist groups. \n \nSecond, his executive action is flawed both in concept and execution. \n \nIn 2015 a State Department spokesperson said of the nearly 785,000 refugees admitted through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program since 9/11 that, \u201conly about a dozen \u2014 a tiny fraction of one percent of admitted refugees \u2014 have been arrested or removed from the U.S. due to terrorism concerns that existed prior to their resettlement in the U.S. None of them were Syrian.\u201d \n \nAlso, the vetting process for refugees runs from 18 to 24 months, sometimes taking a long as three years. Contrary to President Trump no one gets refugee status without documents that\u2019ve been fully vetted. \n \nWhile all seven Trump-designated countries are Muslim-majority they are not all among the world\u2019s most violent; For example, the Central African Republic, South Sudan and DR Congo are listed among the world\u2019s 10 most violent nations but are not on the list \n \nThey\u2019re not on the list, I believe, because they\u2019re not Muslim-majority. \n \nI wonder, too, about Iran\u2019s inclusion. We\u2019ve had no Iranian terrorism in America and they, like us, are targeted by ISIS. Today, America peacefully embraces between 300,000 to 400,000 Iranian-Americans \u2014 Shi\u2019a, Sunni, Baha\u2019i, Jewish, Christian. \n \nIs it about Iran\u2019s aggression toward other peoples? If so, should Saudi Arabia be listed for what they\u2019ve done in Yemen, or Russia for what its participation in genocide in Chechnya and Syria? \n \nDon\u2019t we have any moral responsibility for Syrians queuing for refugee status \u2014 victims of regional destabilization for which we share much blame? And of the over 200,000 Iraqi-Americans present today how many would even have chosen to emigrate if we hadn\u2019t illegally invaded their country? \n \nFor whom do we have responsibility? \n \nSuch bans and discrimination do not increase U.S. security. They\u2019re simply racist and are based on ignorance and bigotry, the same sort of bigotry that deem some peoples inferior to others, as has been done to Native Americans and blacks in America and to Jews, both historically through Christian literature and throughout Europe in the 1930s and '40s. \n \nToday, most Americans remain either willfully ignorant of, or indifferent to, that history and instead embrace a false myth of American Exceptionalism \u2014 which within a Trumpian context means \u201cWhite Exceptionalism.\u201d \n \nSince 9/11, many American citizens have unquestioningly fed upon a mind-numbing diet of hatred and bigotry, to them justified in the name of keeping us safe from \u201cRadical Islamic Terrorism\u201d \u2013 itself code for fear of the Other \u2013 even fear of President Barack Obama, who Trump for years tried to delegitimize. \n \nToday, Muslim and Other are code for all who are not Trump \u2014 all who march for social justice, dignity and equity. \n \nAmerica has a long history of terrorizing the vulnerable, the weak and those whom we believe are less than we. Trump, who has a knack for inflaming and exploiting America\u2019s collective dark side, sadly knows how to exploit that history. \n \nAnd it puts us at risk. \n \nIn a Ha'aretz column, Robert Bank, president of American Jewish World Service writes, \u201cAs the leader of an international Jewish organization that, for decades, has worked with Muslim organizations and Muslim partners to end poverty and advance human rights in some of the poorest countries in the world I believe it is our duty to object in the strongest terms to the demonization of all Muslims by the new American administration. We understand all too well what it means to deny safe harbor to persecuted people who are seeking refuge, and we believe we are at risk of returning to the days when the United States tragically acted with indifference to Jewish and other refugees from Europe during World War II.\u201d \n \nToday, it\u2019s not just Muslims at risk. \n \nIt is We the People \u2013 we are at risk. \n \nRobert Azzi is a photographer and writer who lives in Exeter. He can be reached at theother.azzi@gmail.com and his columns are archived at theotherazzi.wordpress.com \n \nOn Monday, Jan. 30, Azzi will be offering a two-part presentation at the Portsmouth Public Library on Islam in America and \u201cAsk a Muslim Anything.\u201d For more information, visit www.cityofportsmouth.com/library/AskAMuslimAnythingBrief.pdf.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Robert Azzi"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"We the People are at risk","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rockingham","zipCode":"03801","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portsmouth","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Seacoast Online","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169678066","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2297"},"name":"Seacoast Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://seacoastonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197007250","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Such is the case with Trump\u2019s latest Mexico tariff proposal. \n \nI have no doubt Trump floated the idea without much thought, maybe as part of a pending negotiation between the two countries. I also have no doubt this article might be dated before we go to print, but the mere fact Trump suggested the tariff needs to be addressed. Whatever the reason, it is an absolutely stupid idea. \n \nTariffs come in many forms and some are sound in their conception. One example of a tariff might be a fee applied to all ships that \u201cdock\u201d at a port. This type of tariff is common and is comparable to a parking fee you and I might be charged when we park downtown. However, a tariff can only be as high, and fair, as the market is willing to bear. None of you would park in downtown Portsmouth or Dover if the parking was $20 an hour, which would have an adverse effect on a city\u2019s economy (fewer customers means fewer employees, which means fewer goods purchased, etc.). Likewise, a ship would not dock if the cost to do so was disproportionate to the goods or service. Economics 101 has many tenets, one being that the profit ratio has to be within a margin a customer feels is just, while at the same time the merchant knows they are being fairly compensated. \n \nThen there are more punitive types of tariffs, the ones designed to punish, to reduce the flow of goods, that have an adverse effect on a country\u2019s internal commerce, or to protect businesses in our country that also happen to offer the same goods. It is these types of tariffs that seldom benefit the entirety of a nation\u2019s economy. The \u201cTariff of 1828\u201d and \u201cSmoot-Hawley Tariff Act\u201d of the 1930s are two examples. \n \nAlthough slightly different in conception, both had a negative effect on parts or all of our economy.  The Tariff of 1828, which would become known as the Tariff of Abominations, only benefited the economy of the North, in particular New England. The Smoot-Hawley tariff had a devastating effect on our economy, not at first, but as other countries countered with their own tariffs, our economic woes worsened. The Smoot-Hawley tariff came when the U.S. economy was on the brink of total collapse, and served to aggravate the Great Depression. \n \nAlthough Trump\u2019s tariff probably would not be to the extremes of either of these two tariffs, there will be negative consequences. One only needs to follow the flow of agricultural goods between Mexico and the United States to understand the consequences. \n \nThe United States exports approximately $19 billion in agriculture to Mexico. Mexico is the third largest U.S. agricultural export market. Mexico exports approximately $18 billion worth of agricultural goods to the United States. The Trump Tariff would attach a 20 percent fee on all those goods coming to the United States. A tomato or avocado from Mexico would increase in price, compounded at every point of sale. Now, history tells us Mexico would almost certainly apply a similar tariff on our goods coming into their country. That is how a tariff war starts. \n \nThat U.S. farmer that exports pork to Mexico sees a reduction in orders because the cost is more than the market will bear. That pork farmer needs to adjust his model, which includes fewer workers, less need to transport goods, a reduction in grain purchases to feed his livestock and so on. A tariff of any percentage would have a devastating effect to our country, especially to an economy that only grew 1.6 percent over this past year (U.S. economic growth in 2016).  \n \nPresident Trump promised to build a wall between Mexico and the United States. Trump additionally promised Mexico would pay for that wall. I happen to believe in a physical barrier between Mexico and the United States. Mexico is a country in crisis with serious internal security issues. This border in particular is extremely vulnerable to the point that those wishing to do this country harm exploit the Mexico-U.S. border. However, a physical barrier can only be one part of an effective security strategy. In the end, it is the responsibility of the United States to provide for its own security needs. \n \nMake no mistake; Americans will pay for this wall, directly or through increased cost due to a tariff war. This tariff will hurt the U.S. and Mexican economies. Hopefully, I am correct about Trump coming to his senses on this tariff. If not, Congress should not support this economic lunacy, and a more commonsense approach to funding our southern border security needs should be presented, discussed and supported. If not, everyday Americans will pay a steep price. \n \nJeff Chidester was raised in Portsmouth and is a lifelong resident of New Hampshire.

This is a good thing. \n \nThis new government should aim to act boldly and quickly. \n \nFor conservatives, there are also smaller but significant issues \u2014 points of unfinished business, some dating back as far as President Reagan \u2014 that should be completed. \n \nHere are five, all of which are doable. \n \nFirst, repeal Davis-Bacon. This law, which was enacted in 1931 and purports to ensure that workers on public projects are paid the prevailing local wage, was in fact a pay-off to Big Labor for its support of the Democratic Party. It costs taxpayers dearly. \n \nBy inflating labor costs, Davis-Bacon inflates overall construction costs for the federal government. If the Trump administration and Congress are going to do an infrastructure bill to push the economy forward, repealing Davis-Bacon would increase its impact. \n \nRepeal would also make the point that taxpayers should not be footing the bill to pay off special interests such as trade unions. Repeal of Davis-Bacon could be included in a reconciliation bill. \n \nSecond, pass medical malpractice tort reform. Just as President Trump and Congress look to replace ObamaCare by delivering better care at a lower cost, fixing the legal system around healthcare should be a no-brainer. This reform can and should move quickly and early. \n \nThe Congress could even follow a template set out by the state of California a generation ago. It would mean that doctors and hospitals would not have to constantly order unnecessary tests and procedures just to protect themselves from scurrilous lawyers. \n \nThey could actually practice quality medicine instead of defensive medicine. Costs would go down and patients would receive the care they need, not the care dictated by fear of inappropriate lawsuits. \n \nThird, take back Congress\u2019s constitutional responsibility to control the funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and make it answerable to elected government. \n \nThe manner in which the CFPB was set up was an obscene relinquishment of Congress\u2019s obligation to govern. The CFPB is the only federal agency which essentially answers to no-one. It is funded totally independently of the Congress and it has no oversight. It is a rogue agency. \n \nThe CFPB needs to be reined in before it does real damage. At a minimum, its funding should be subject to review and its leadership answerable to lawmakers. These changes could also be done through reconciliation. \n \nSince the early days of the Reagan presidency, right up to the present, National Public Radio (NPR) has been the voice of the left. It pursues an unending and vicious editorial policy that attacks conservatives and Republicans. It is incomprehensible that dollars raised through taxes from conservative and moderate Americans should be used to subsidize NPR\u2019s extreme liberal agenda. \n \nNPR has the right to say and report whatever it wishes, but it should not have its efforts paid for by American taxpayers. Any funding that goes to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting should be fenced so it cannot be used to underwrite NPR. This approach should have been taken years ago. It should be structured as a cut in spending and put in reconciliation. \n \nFifth, reform the civil service so that the large number of people who work for the government and are not doing anything but sitting at desks can be dropped from the taxpayers\u2019 expense account. \n \nOnce again, reconciliation could be used \u2014 in this instance, to direct a ten percent reduction in the workforces of all federal agencies, with the exception of the Department of Defense. \n \nA system-wide cut in personnel, using attrition and allowing termination for non-performance, is the only way to get real action. The 19th century Pendleton Act was supposed to protect the federal workforce from direct political cronyism. But instead, the culture has become one of liberal-agenda cronyism. \n \nThe federal workforce needs a major do-over, but a marginal downsizing of about 10 percent is at least a good place to start. This also can be done in reconciliation. \n \nThis Congress has the opportunity to do a great deal. Much of it can and needs to be accomplished by aggressively using reconciliation. \n \nThese are Five Easy Pieces, which would allow this new government to help put together the puzzle that will produce a better government. \n \nJudd Gregg of Rye is a former governor and three-term senator from New Hampshire who served as chairman and ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, and as ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Foreign Operations subcommittee.

received by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, gripes regarding debt collections from the military community numbered twice the rate of the general population. \n \nThat's rather surprising when you consider that servicemen and women, veterans and their families are covered not only by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which applies to everyone, but also by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The latter postpones or suspends certain civil obligations to enable service members to devote their full attention to their military duties. \n \nThat the CFPB has fielded nearly 20,000 complaints from servicemembers is terrible news, indeed. But there's also good news from the financial field \u2014 especially from the housing industry \u2014 when it comes to the military. \n \nHere's a peek at just some of the \"thank you for your service\" efforts being taken on behalf of the military: \n \n■ Barbara Mills, a RE/MAX Realty One agent in Inverness, Florida, has arranged hundreds of small parties to greet individual warriors returning home from the Middle East. She also arranged a larger event for 140 National Guardsmen who arrived all at once. Each soldier or sailor is given a gift basket valued at about $450. Each basket also contains $500 or so in checks and other gifts from member of the Citrus County community. \n \n■ Army Sgt. Matthew White and his two dogs, Nike and Toffee, recently received the keys to a new mortgage-free, fully furnished home in Dumfries, Virginia. The house was donated by PulteGroup's Built to Honor program, which gives new homes to wounded veterans and their families across the country. (White was injured while on a foot patrol during his second deployment to Afghanistan.) Pulte has given away dozens of houses under the program. \n \nMore than 50 national and local contractors, trade partners and Pulte employees donated time, money and resources to build the 1,800-square-foot townhouse. The home's furniture was donated by TV personality Rachael Ray. \n \n■ Bank of America has given more than 2,000 abandoned and foreclosed houses to such nonprofit partners as HomeStrong USA and the Military Warriors Support Foundation, which vet the eventual recipients to make sure they can handle the responsibilities of homeownership. The bank's employees volunteer thousands of hours to help put the houses into move-in condition, including stocking the pantries with canned goods. \n \n■ SunTrust honored vets on the Thursday before Memorial Day last year. At exactly 11 a.m., the bank's 35,000 employees stopped what they were doing for a moment of silence to honor the fallen \u2014 even if a teller or loan officer was with a customer. And in many cases, customers bowed their heads right along. \n \n■ In conjunction with local groups, Freddie Mac \u2014 the giant quasi-government secondary market institution that helps keep the mortgage money flowing \u2014 offers free homeownership counseling during American Heroes Housing Fairs and Open Houses throughout the country. Counseling is open to both active and retired military, as well as educators, firefighters, police and other first responders. \n \n■ The Chesty Puller House in Saluda County, Virginia, is intended to be a refuge for at-risk Marines of all ranks, from privates to generals, before they reach the point of considering suicide. In 2015, to raise money for this cause, Dave Biggers of real estate technology firm A La Mode matched donations, dollar-for-dollar, from customers, employees and anyone else who felt compelled to donate. \n \n■ Brint Construction, a Texas-based, family-owned homebuilder, designed and built the Lone Survivor Foundation's first retreat center in Bolivar, Texas. The space provides therapeutic healing and educational support for soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and other wounds associated with combat. \n \n■ Greystone Real Estate Partners of Charleston, South Carolina, is among a number of firms involved with Homes Fit for Heroes, a foundation that provides apartments to wounded special operations warriors \u2014 SEALs, Green Berets, Rangers, Night Stalkers, Delta Force members and others \u2014 while they recover from their wounds. \n \nThese are just a few examples of how real estate folks try to give back. There are too many others to list here. But we salute all of them, as well as the warriors they are helping. \n \nLew Sichelman has been covering real estate for more than 30 years.

Admission is free. Hours are 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Host Harold Bubil will moderate the panel discussions; Kathryn Parks is co-host of the event. \n \nMichael Saunders & Co. is the presenting sponsor. The real estate brokerage, now in its 41st year, can expect to earn more than a few commissions selling houses in those communities in the coming decades. Both the West Villages and Babcock Ranch could have close to 50,000 residents by 2050 or so. Lakewood Ranch has about 22,000 now and continues to grow. \n \nIn fact, the West Villages, in just one year, has become the No. 4 community on the list of fastest-selling master-planned communities in the nation. Lakewood Ranch, for several years perched at No. 9 on the same list, has moved up to No. 5. \n \n\u201cHaving two of the top fastest-selling master-planned communities in the country continues to reinforce that Sarasota County is desirable and we\u2019re attractive,\u201d Black said, \u201cnot only as a retirement community but from a lifestyle perspective \u2014 people wanting to live here, establish businesses and bring their businesses to our community.\u201d \n \nThe West Villages scored a major coup in the past week by earning a commitment from the Atlanta Braves to move its Major League spring-training camp to North Port, along with minor-league player development operations and a sports rehabilitation academy. \n \nBuilderFest will include home builders and remodelers discussing the building process, the remodeling decision, new-home design and green building. Michael Saunders and developer-builder Pat Neal of Neal Communities will join a panel discussion on the outlook for the real estate market in the coming months. \n \nThroughout the day, audience members can meet with builders and developers to learn about home building and remodeling. \n \nBuilders who would like to purchase display tables may contact Ann.Glass@heraldtribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Construction news","group":"Industry"}],"title":"BuilderFest event to feature master-planning companies","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Charlotte","zipCode":"33952","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Port Charlotte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southwest Florida Herald Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169670275","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"793"},"name":"Southwest Florida Herald Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197012641","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Seven days later, norms and doctrine that have guided the United States for decades are being re-examined. \n \nTrump's down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address: a call to arms that tested old distinctions between left and right. \n \n\"Today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another,\" he said. \n \n\"We are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.\" \n \n\n \nUS President Donald Trump's down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address: a call to arms for the era of \"America first\" \n \nThe establishment \"elites\" in big cities, in politics and the media were no longer the technocrats in charge of the world's only superpower, they were the enemy. \n \nThe new president also put the rest of the world on notice. \n \nFor the last 75 years, America had been what Barack Obama described as the \"indispensable nation\" \u2014 the glue that bound the global order. \n \nThe era of Trump would be the era of \"America first,\" he said, of naked self-interest and zero-sum diplomacy. Old alliances would be reassessed, new alliances would be explored. \n \nBefore his inauguration, many asked if the presidency would change Donald Trump, or whether Donald Trump would change the presidency. \n \nBarely 20 minutes into his four-year term, anyone who was listening had their answer. \n \n\n \nKeeping Trump's campaign promises \n \nBefore arriving at the Oval Office, Trump's strategists had decided to use the first few weeks to unleash a daily wave of executive orders. \n \nThe aim was to unbalance opponents, define Trump as a man of action and slake his supporters' thirst for change. \n \nFor much of middle America, globalization, automation and the Great Recession had been apocalyptic. \n \nPolitics had passed them over and worse, they felt steamrollered by \"coastal elites\" in America's \"culture wars\" over abortion, gay rights, immigration, global warming and religion. \n \nTrump had won the election by promising to be their champion, and he was going to \u2014 as Ronald Reagan said \u2014 \"dance with the one that brung ya.\" \n \nFor the most part, the CEO-in-chief put forward actions that could have come from any Republican in the country: defunding abortion, preening the military and approving oil pipelines. \n \nBut it was coated with a thick veneer of nationalist and populist rhetoric, and accompanying policies championed by top aide Steve Bannon. \n \n\n \nTrump ripped up a trans-Pacific trade deal designed to counterbalance China's regional economic power, imposed a ban on refugees from Syria and migrants from seven other Muslim countries. \n \nHe ordered planning to begin to build a wall on Mexico's southern border and picked a very public fight with Mexico's president Enrique Pena Nieto, who cancelled a trip to Washington. \n \nThe United States, a nation founded by migrants, was now willing to shut its doors. \n \nNot since Obama's election or perhaps the Iraq War has America's image around the world changed so dramatically and so quickly. \n \nBut Trump supporters saw an outsider sticking up for them and sticking it to the elites. \n \n\"Get used to it,\" said Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, boasting that Trump had delivered a \"shock to the system.\" \n \n\"And he's just getting started,\" she said. \n \n\u2013 Rocky start \u2013 \n \nBut it was not all positive for Trump. The White House is far from purring. Key positions have yet to be filled and the decision making process is haphazard. \n \nTrump aides were forced to publicly row back suggestions of a 20 percent border tax on Mexican goods and defend a chaotic rollout of the refugee and migrant ban. \n \n\n \nThroughout the week, Trump engaged in intemperate outbursts about the size of his inaugural crowd, alleged election fraud and perceived media persecution. \n \nPrivately, in call after call, he complained to top aides about press coverage. The impression was of a man focused on his image more than running the country. \n \nTrump also seemed like a a man for whom becoming US president was not adulation enough. \n \nSpokesman Sean Spicer \u2014 between tirades and missteps \u2014 offered a window onto the soul of the White House. \n \n\"There's this constant theme to undercut the enormous support he has,\" Spicer said. \n \n\"It's unbelievably frustrating when you're continually told it's not big enough; it's not good enough. You can't win.\" \n \nAccording to a Quinnipiac poll, Trump's approval rating at the end of his first week stood at 36 percent. \n \nBut critics saw a more sinister motive for the outbursts, particularly Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that three million people voted illegally in the election. \n \nBrian Klaas, an expert on global democracy at the London School of Economics, sees Trump \"casting aspersions (without evidence) on electoral integrity is a key way to restrict voting rights and erode confidence in elections.\" \n \n\"Attacking the media and blurring the lines of truth with state narratives not grounded in fact is important to sowing public doubt,\" he said. \n \nMindy Finn, who ran as a independent vice presidential candidate, summed up Trump's strategy as \"sow chaos, deepen division and consolidate power.\" \n \nFor his harshest critics, the question is now whether Donald Trump breaks the presidency, or whether the presidency breaks Donald Trump. \n \nOriginal Article \n \nDonal Trump: U.S President's First Week In Power \nDonal Trump: U.S President's First Week In Power \nDonal Trump: U.S President's First Week In Power \nDonal Trump: U.S President's First Week In Power \nDonal Trump: U.S President's First Week In Power \n Donal Trump: U.S President's First Week In Power  Donal Trump: U.S President's First Week In Power","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Donal Trump: U.S president\u2019s first week in power","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Akwa Ibom State News Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608972085","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Akwa Ibom State News Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://akwaibomstatenews.online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://catalogue.afp.com/__assets/english/shared/top/01f076ab043b54974c18863576f41e8ee5f92653.jpg","http://catalogue.afp.com/__assets/english/shared/top/de3bc1bd5a4c2de19388be2e8d4ca87018b53519.jpg","http://catalogue.afp.com/__assets/english/shared/top/ad76c9f2442fc089c784cbccdaa7d9ab0eb31ce7.jpg","http://catalogue.afp.com/__assets/english/shared/top/26f1e38a106f7d2684ef1156001533664fb29145.jpg","http://pulse.ng/world/donal-trump-u-s-presidents-first-week-in-power-id6132722.html"],"sequenceId":"695197015626","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2454","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Bellingen","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Bellingen Shire Courier-Sun","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"348396351","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"The Bellingen Shire Courier-Sun","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bellingencourier.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197022248","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It is a good one, and other persons have e-mailed me asking the same thing. \n \nThe answer is no. Titles in Jamaica do not have an expiry date. Once you have a title that is issued by the National Land Agency's Titles Office, you have a document that will, more than likely, outlive you. \n \nAs to the person who sought to find out about persons claiming their properties by adverse possession, I will give you the suggestions to ensure that this doesn't happen, or at least make it harder for the squatter to make an ownership claim. \n \nFirst, try to have your property surveyed then fenced along the correct boundaries. \n \na) Try to give someone permission to occupy the property. \n \nb) Lease the property to someone. The cost of the lease is inconsequential. Just ensure that there is a lease agreement between you and the lessee. \n \nc) Visit your property at least once every three years. At worst, you should not let seven years elapse and you not visit your property, especially vacant property. \n \nIn the event you visit your property and someone is occupying it without your permission, give them permission in writing or even lease it to them for $1. This will establish that you gave permission for them to be on your property and would make it difficult for them to make an application to own your property by adverse possession. \n \nSo those persons who reside overseas and have property in Jamaica, especially in the rural areas, and that property is unoccupied, you need to take note of all I have written to ensure that when you come back to Jamaica and visit, some other owner is not there barring you from entering as they have a registered title in their name as owners of what used to be 'your' property. \n \nNext week, I will discuss what is adverse possession and the criteria to qualify to get a title by such means. \n \nUntil next time, traverse well. \n \nn Craig Francis is a commissioned land surveyor and managing director of Precision Surveying Services Ltd.

Here's what a handful of small businesses, startups and analysts are seeing in their crystal balls. \n \n1. We will hear more about how autonomous cars connect to the network. \n \n\"Autonomous cars won't use the network to drive--they will rely on on-board systems--but different types of connectivity (V2X) can improve the overall transport systems, for example by improving traffic flow. We expect more developments in 2017 as car companies, network operators, governments and others explore the benefits, the business case and the technology options for connectivity.\" \n \n--Tom Rebbeck, research director at Analysys Mason, specialist advisory firm for the telecoms, media and technology industry. \n \n2. Funding will skew toward artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). And most of it will be a bust. \n \n\"With a massive potential return for whoever can crack the AI nut, VCs will swarm startups in these spaces like sharks smelling chum in the water. But don't expect a feeding frenzy. Most of these startups will crash and burn without ever turning a profit. That said, a select few will drive truly deep innovation, and in doing so, reshape the world.\" \n \n--Rod Favaron, president and CEO of Spredfast, a software platform which enables companies to manage, integrate, and amplify social content across digital touch points. \n \n3. Mobile will continue to rise as the primary shopping platform. \n \n\"The online customer is getting younger. In the past year, our business has seen a shift to a younger generation, which means that we are processing a lot more mobile purchases than ever before. We now have around 40 percent of sales on mobile. This also impacts the way we display our products on our website and how customers are able to navigate.\" \n \n--Rocky Schiano, owner of Street Sounds NYC, an e-commerce business with presence on eBay and a storefront in Brooklyn, New York, which sells guitars, musical instruments and other music accessories. \n \n4. A shift to social is essential to succeed in the online marketplace. \n \n\"In 2016, we really worked to diversify our business. Consumers are getting smarter about what they want so we have added more products, new technologies and, most importantly, adapted our business to be more social. We have now developed videos to showcase our unique product set to build trust for the consumer, but also because it's easier to digest over social platforms. We have seen a 100 percent increase in video traffic over the past month.\" \n \n--Jordan Insley, owner of QuickShip Electronics, an e-commerce seller of consumer electronics including TVs, tablets, consumers and more. \n \n5. Technology will play a bigger role in food sourcing for restaurants. \n \n\"There are quite a few trends that are going to change the way we eat in 2017 - for the better - from the farm, to behind the scenes in restaurant kitchens, to the dining table itself. For example, 'Seed to Stomach': the growth of food tracking applications to discover exactly where every ingredient on a restaurant menu is sourced is going to become more of the norm in 2017. We'll also see many more local suppliers who used to get passed over by technology, enabled by cloud-based platforms, which will make it easy to bring more locally sourced foods to restaurants. This means not only more farm-to-table eateries, but also more seasonal, creative items on the menu.\" \n \n--Guy Even Ezra, founder and CEO of SimpleOrder, an online platform for restaurant purchasing and inventory management. \n \n6. Business intelligence will be democratised. \n \n\"Traditional business intelligence has been the realm of BI experts, which forced the BI team into the role of information broker. BI is becoming easier for anyone within a company to access the information she or he needs, without BI or analytics expertise. Different types of users can utilize BI that is relevant to their roles; a product manager can focus on issues within their application, and a CMO can focus on marketing campaign-related results. With everyone in a company able to see a clear picture of their responsibilities delivering on goals becomes much easier; and having a single source of truth company-wide helps all teams align around the company vision.\" \n \n--David Drai, cofounder and CEO of real-time anomaly detection and analytics firm Anodot. \n \n7. Freight will cost less as small business supply chains get big business capabilities. \n \n\"Companies like Apple have built their empires on pitch-perfect supply chains. Their trick is great bargaining power, combined with incredible access to data. As LogTech brings the logistics industry online, backed by $5 billion of VC investments in 2016, data is getting more transparent. Real-time access to information is a game-changer, enabling the smallest companies to easily source globally, just like multi-nationals.\" \n \n--Dr. Zvi Schreiber, founder and CEO of online freight marketplace Freightos. \n \n8. Customer service and business transactions over social messaging channels will rise. \n \n\"Social messaging channels such as Facebook Messenger and Twitter Direct Message are becoming increasingly important tools for brand engagement and customer service resolution. Big brands are already seeing a major shift from public posts to private messages. Innovative technologies will only further that trend as they open up new opportunities for seamless customer to business interactions, including chat bots, flight reservations, and payment transactions. As social platforms continue to adopt these new technologies in 2017, brands and customers alike will turn to messaging channels for more efficient, personal and effortless resolution.\" \n \n--Joshua March, founder and CEO of social customer engagement platform Conversocial. \n \n9. Music is the next big tech investment. \n \n\"It is prime time that investors, separate from the TechStars accelerator program, turn their attention to music tech startups. and they are beginning to notice it. In the past year alone, we have seen multiple organizations emerge to help support music startups, including Project Music, Marathon Labs, and others all aimed at solving existing problems within the industry. With the welcoming of 2017, we'll see a push towards technology investments in the sector. This boom in capital will result in huge spikes in innovation, addressing the common woes of tracking, management, and remuneration for artists.\" \n \n--Bruno Guez, founder and CEO of Revelator, a cloud-based provider of data management services for the music industry. \n \n10. Small businesses will discover opportunities with new generic top-level domains (gTLDs). \n \n\"There are now more opportunities in the domain space than ever before. The industry previously struggled with marketing to consumers, but recently we have seen a growing effort around showcasing the value in using domain extensions outside of .com. Heading into the new year, we will see more businesses experiment with new gTLDs and take advantage of the creative ways to use domain extensions in branding.\" \n \n--Francesco Cetraro, head of operations for .cloud, a top-level domain for the cloud industry, startups, creative professionals, online retailers and bloggers. \n \n11. Personalization will play a greater role in loyalty programs. \n \n\"Towards the end of 2016, we saw more travel loyalty programs take action to increase personalization, realising that loyalty is not a one-size-fits-all. By leveraging geographic and behavioral member data, loyalty programs can better understand their members' needs and habits on an individual basis, and deliver the right offer to the right member at the right time. We'll see more programs follow suit in the next year.\" \n \n--Danielle Brown, VP of marketing at Points, a loyalty currency management platform.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"}],"title":"11 Tech Predictions for the rest of 2017","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Jamaica Gleaner","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169811126","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"58"},"name":"Jamaica Gleaner","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197034226","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:41Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In the words of Justice Sykes, in the earlier of the two judgments he delivered: \"In intellectual property cases it is common for the trial to take place in two stages. The first stage deals with liability, and if there is liability, then the second stage deals with the remedy.\" \n \nJustice Sykes then went on to set a September date for the second phase of the trial. \n DAMAGES & ADDITIONAL DAMAGES  \nInterestingly, both \"Damages and Additional Damages\" were awarded to TVJ in this case, notwithstanding the submissions of Queen's Counsel Charles Piper, for CVM, for only nominal damages to be awarded. \n \nIn the view of Justice Sykes, the only legitimate way for CVM to have gained access to the material used in its 'Return to the Nest' programme, and in other infringing uses, was by paying for a licence from TVJ. \n \nHaving, therefore, considered the expert evidence of Oliver McIntosh, CEO of SportsMax, as to how such licences were priced and marketed in the industry, Justice Sykes then went on to hold that CVM was to pay TVJ US$85,975.00 by way of damages. \n \nThe sum in question represented a 50/50 share of the US$172,750.00 cost paid by TVJ for the rights in question and to bring them to Jamaica. \n \nJustice Sykes then went on to award \"additional damages\" in favour of TVJ. \n \nIn Paragraph 51 of the judgment, Justice Sykes states: \"Section 32 (2) of the Copyright Act, permits an award of additional damages having regard to (a) the benefit accruing to the defendant; (b) the flagrancy of the infringement and (c) all other material considerations. It is this court's considered opinion that additional damages are in order. The conduct of CVM can properly be described as deliberate and calculated risk taking.\" [emphasis added] \n \nIn the view of Justice Sykes, CVM's breach of TVJ's rights in the World Championships programme went beyond a mere breach. It was flagrant. \n \nThe words of Sykes at Paragraph 65 of the said judgment are particularly strident: \n \n\"The Return to the Nest programme made no pretence at reporting current events. It was not a news programme. It was an audacious taking and using of exclusive licence-protected material, which continued despite verbal and written complaints from TVJ ... . It was deliberate, calculated risk taking. There was no deceit. There was no dishonesty. Nonetheless, the breach was flagrant. [emphasis added] \n \nHaving determined that CVM's breach was flagrant, Justice Sykes, therefore, went on to award US$40,000.00 in additional damages to TVJ. \n COSTS  \nGeorgia Gibson Henlin, Queens Counsel, who represented TVJ, also persuaded the court with her submissions on costs. \n \nAlthough TVJ had not succeeded in every single instance of breach claimed, Gibson-Henlin argued that there should be no deduction of costs for failure on some issues, but rather, that full costs should be awarded to TVJ since it had won \"the lion's share\" of the issues and was the party that had been ruled entitled to damages. \n \nWhile Justice Sykes agreed with Henlin-Gibson that TVJ was entitled to full costs, he fell just short of ordering same as the judge ruled that an additional day had been added to the second phase of the trial because TVJ had failed to organise itself in a particular instance. \n \nWhile CVM has appealed the judgments, the case represents a treasure trove for media practitioners, intellectual property lawyers, and generally, for anyone who republishes copyrighted material. \n \nKudos to Justice Sykes for his industry in concluding the two phases of the trial quickly and delivering written judgments. \n \nn Shena Stubbs is an attorney-at-law and legal commentator.

The specifics of the transition are being worked out, and I am content to wait until the issues are determined,\" said Phillips. \n \n\"In the meantime, I continue to fulfil my responsibilities in my constituency, as opposition spokesman, and to formulate my thoughts about the challenges of renewal and recharging of PNP's energies,\" added Phillips. \n \nThe veteran Comrade, who seems poised to be elected PNP president unopposed, said that individuals from a wide cross section of the party have reached out to him and there is a continuous exchange of views at divisional and regional levels. \n \nPhillips said that individuals have sought his advice on some party issues, and while he has shared his views, he has pushed matters to the right channels, while advising that the instant concerns must be addressed elsewhere. \n \n\"In doing all of this, one has to be mindful all the time that there is one president of the party, and in any organisation, you can't confuse authority that flows from the office in that sense. \n \n\"So we are doing all of this but still recognising the centre of authority, which still exists, amid all of this, through the party president,\" said Phillips. \n \nHe added: \"One has to be mindful of confusion, and at the risk of causing offence, unwittingly, that can arise in situations. But I think our understanding in the party, and that of the party leader, is clear cut, and I am certainly not going to usurp any decision that properly belongs to the president of the party.\" \n unusual situation  \nPhillips, who has held several roles in the PNP over the years, including the key organisational posts of general secretary and vice-president, admits that the current situation is unusual. \n \n\"It is true that in all the transitions we have had thus far in the party, you have had a period declared for the contest. There has been a contest and result following that. \n \n\"In this particular circumstance, what you have is no other declared candidate and a period of transition that is indeterminate. Not by any action on my part ... ,\" said Phillips. \n \n\"It is unusual in that sense, but I think it will be well managed by the party because the PNP has durable structures and enormous goodwill within the party among the Comrades, which will keep everything on a proper and even keel,\" added Phillips. \n \nerica.virtue@gleanerjm.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Erica Virtue"},"topics":[],"title":"Waiting, waiting, waiting - Peter won't push Portia despite uncertainty over when she will depart","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Jamaica Gleaner","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169811126","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"58"},"name":"Jamaica Gleaner","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197037366","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(An Act to repeal and replace the Road Traffic Act; to establish the Island Traffic Authority for the regulation and control of traffic on roads; to improve road safety and transport efficiency and reduce the cost of administering road transport; to create new categories of driver's licences; and for connected matters). \n \nHere are edited excerpts from his presentation. \n \nWe all agree that the passing of this Road Traffic Act is critical. \n \nGlobally, about 1.25 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes. Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability as a result of their injuries. Road traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to victims, their families, and to nations as a whole. \n \nAs of yesterday, January 23, 2017: \n \nn Twenty persons (17 males and three females) have lost their lives on the nation's roads with the overriding cause of these deaths being reckless use of the roadways. \n \nA further breakdown shows that: \n \nn 10 persons (50%) were pedestrians \n \nn 7 persons (35%) were motorcyclists, \n \nn 2 persons were private motor vehicle drivers, \n \nn and one person was a commercial motor vehicle driver. \n \nWhile this is less than the 27 road fatalities recorded for the corresponding period in 2016, the trend of approximately one death per day continues. \n \nAll Jamaicans must make road safety a priority. We cannot continue to lose our people to fatal crashes, which are largely preventable. \n \nStatistics from the Road Safety Unit within the Ministry of Transport and Mining reveal that the main causes of fatal crashes were: \n \nn excessive speeding, \n \nn drivers failing to keep to the correct side of the roadway (overtaking), \n \nn and, of note, pedestrian error. \n \nIt is the responsibility, not only of our road users, but our regulators, road developers, law-enforcement officers and all citizens of this country to ensure that we reverse this worrying trend. \n \nIt is important for us to get into our psyche that there are no 'accidents'. Road crashes are largely preventable and we cannot ignore the impact: \n \nn The pain, suffering and, possibly, loss of earnings of persons disabled by injuries. \n \nn The anguish of families, friends and entire communities who are grieving. \n \nn The tireless efforts of health personnel in an already burdened health system. \n \nn The strain on emergency services and even the public to assist in critical moments. \n \nn The loss in productivity that may result in the increased commuting time and/or distance. \n \n... I could continue to highlight the devastating effects, but we are familiar as citizens and have all been impacted in some way. \n ROLE OF LEGISLATION  \nThe Government recognises that while we continue to urge persons to practise better road use, improved laws must be in place to deal with persons who put all Jamaicans, but, particularly, our most vulnerable, our senior citizens and our children, at risk. The actions we all take to address road safety must be holistic and it requires all hands on deck. \n \nThere must be complete involvement and co-ordination around this initiative. \n \nLegislation must be revised and reviewed in order to ensure that it remains relevant, aligns with international best practices and serves the best interest of our nation. \n \nWe are all aware that our existing Road Traffic Act dates back to 1938 and, therefore, its repeal and replacement are long overdue. While we welcome ease of mobility, with the needed improvement to our roads and advances in technology such as smart phones, these developments must not be at the expense of our safety. \n \nThe new provisions and modifications to the new Road Traffic Act take us a significant way in ameliorating the critical issues faced by Jamaicans on the road and achieves our objective to align the provisions of our laws with international best practices. \n \nIt takes into account: \n \nn traffic management \n \nn the increase in the number of vehicles \n \nn the advancement in vehicle performance, \n \nn changes in technology \n \nn and improvements in the road networks, \n \nn and will improve road safety, aid in crime detection and prevention, and reduce road traffic crashes, injuries and deaths. \n CRITICAL FEATURES OF THE NEW ROAD TRAFFIC ACT  \nA. Section 20, under Part 4 of the Act, establishes new requirements for drivers, making it mandatory to have a licence in possession while operating a vehicle. This will ensure that the police can identify drivers and confirm that they are allowed to operate the vehicles being driven. \n \nB. Section 121 establishes a restriction on hand-held use of electronic communication devices while driving. This is critical to minimising distraction, as we recognise that driving is a complex task requiring intense cognitive participation. International statistical data have shown that drivers using mobile phones are approximately four times more likely to be involved in a crash. \n \nC. The Act significantly updates the drivers' licensing system: \n \ni. Section 23 deals with the grant and duration of learner's permits - The minimum age for a learner's permit is 17 and issuance requires a minimum of six months of driver training. \n \nIt will now be a requirement to pass the Road Code Test before a learners permit is issued. The holder of the learner's permit must be accompanied at all times while driving by a person who is the holder of a driver's licence for not less than three years. \n \nD. Section 27 requires newly licensed drivers to be subject to restrictions regarding breath alcohol concentration and speed. The level for this category is now 0.01% while operating a vehicle, and they cannot exceed the limit of 80 km/hour on any road, including the toll roads where the limit is 110 km/hour. \n \nIt has been shown that young and novice drivers are subject to an increased risk of road traffic crashes when under the influence of alcohol and/or excessive speed when compared to older and more experienced drivers. \n LEGISLATION ESTABLISHES NEW CLASSIFICATIONS  OF LICENCES  \n1.  Class A: Motorcycles - There has been a significant increase in the number of motorcyclists on our roads and, therefore, the new legislation now requires that all learner drivers must pass the Road Code Test before receiving a learner's permit. Also a person can now only ride a motorcycle with a learner's permit if he is accompanied by a licensed rider. \n \n2. Class B:  Private car and light trucks (not for reward), and vehicles specially modified for persons with a prescribed physical disability. \n \n3. Class C:  Commercial and PPV vehicles \n \nThe sixth schedule of the Act revises the Demerit Point System, with one of its specific objectives being to ensure reduced speed in school zones and construction work zones. \n \nThe points system will be also be rationalised, as will the levels of fines applicable to offences. This will ensure consistency related to similar offences. \n \nTraffic fines and penalties are increased substantially and are now more appropriate given intervening inflation.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Jamaica news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Critical moves needed to end road carnage - PM","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Jamaica Gleaner","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169811126","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"58"},"name":"Jamaica Gleaner","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197038189","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Right now it costs over $300,000 a month. That includes payment for the trucks, the material, and also labour,\" said Alrick Francis, city inspector at the KSAC. \n \n\"The washing is usually done either late at nights or early in the morning to ensure that persons are not put out of their way,\" added Francis. \n \nHe lamented that even after a $121 million upgrade by the Urban Development Corporation (UDC) in 2010, members of the public continue to urinate on and around the perimeter fence of the park, which has a well-maintained bathroom. \n \nThis has been a problem for many years, and park manager Marcia King is among those pointing the finger at one particular group of offenders. \n \n\"Most of the persons doing it are the (Jamaica Urban Transit Company) bus drivers. Other people do it, too, but mainly, it is the drivers. You notice how they park the buses back-to-back? What they do is just go around it,\" said King. \n \nShe said that higglers, vendors, and general passers-by are also included among those who pee on the park regularly. \n UNZIPPING PUBLICLY  \nAccording to King, the matter has been brought to the attention of the KSAC, and she was told that the municipal body had initiated dialogue with the JUTC about it but nothing had changed. \n \n\"Even today (last Wednesday), I was coming through and I see a man and him say, 'Woo! It a come dung pon me', and him underpants actually draw down,\" recalled King. \n \n\"I said to him, 'See the bathroom there open up'. Is Sunday. We washed the park, and my God!\" added King. \n \nOur news team also saw a vendor of eyeglasses unzip his pants metres away from the bathroom and urinate just inside the park's western gate. \n \n\"Fi tell you the truth - cause the whole a we a big man, zeen - me nuh pee-pee a daytime, and me nuh pee pee a night-time, but true it come down pon me, fambily,\" said the vendor. \n \n\"Real thing, is the bathroom me come to go but me bladder weak, so me have to stop here. But me know seh me nuffi do it. Me know better,\" added the vendor, who rinsed his hands with water he had with him. \n \nThere are at least four tiled, freshly painted and regularly cleaned bathrooms at the park, each monitored by female attendants juggling morning and evening shifts. \n SMALL FEE  \nThe rest rooms are open from 6 a.m., and members of the public are provided toilet tissue and asked to make a $30 contribution with each use. The money is collected at the end of the week and used to purchase cleaning agents. \n \n\"A lot of the people don't want to pay the money, and the JUTC driver them worse. Most of dem, because dem don't want to pay, just urinate outside on the wall,\" charged Keisha, who monitors one of the rest rooms closest to the northern perimeter fence, where the JUTC buses are often parked, awaiting deployment. \n \nWhen contacted last week, Reginald Allen, marketing and communications manager at the JUTC, said the company was not aware of the staff using the walls of the park as a urinal and the state agency would condemn any such behaviour. \n \n\"The JUTC has a major office facility at East Parade, which is less than 100 metres from the farthest point of the north wall of St William Grant Park. The office is open daily from 5 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., with bathroom facilities for the convenience of all the staff operating in the Parade area,\" said Allen. \n \n\"The drivers all leave depots with full bathroom facilities between 4 and 5 a.m., with their arrival and positioning of the buses at Parade normally coinciding with the opening of the East Parade office,\" added Allen. \n \ncorey.robinson@gleanerjm.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Corey Robinson"},"topics":[{"name":"Jamaica news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"'Peeing' on the park","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Jamaica Gleaner","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169811126","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"58"},"name":"Jamaica Gleaner","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197039125","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He's one of the staff members, part of an increasingly grey workforce in an increasingly grey country.\n\n\"I enjoy talking to the people here. It's fun, but it's also hard work,\" Odaira said during a break from his caregiving duties on a recent day.\n\nJapan is considered a \"super-aging\" society. More than a quarter of the population is over 65, a figure set to rise to 40 percent by 2050. The average life expectancy is 85, and that means many Japanese remain relatively healthy for a good two decades after retirement age.\n\nAt the same time, the birthrate has plummeted to well below the level needed to keep the population stable. Now home to 128 million people, Japan is expected to number less than 100 million by 2050, according to government projections.\n\nThat means authorities need to think about ways to keep seniors healthy and active for longer, but also about how to augment the workforce to cope with labor shortages. At Cross Heart, more than half of the 119 caregivers are over 60, and 15 of them are over 70.\n\n\"When we advertise for people to work here, we get lots of responses from older people, not younger people,\" said nursing home director Kaori Yokoo in the lobby where residents were doing leg curls and chest presses on weight machines.\n\nThe foundation that runs this nursing home and others in Kanagawa Prefecture has raised the official retirement age to 70 but allows employees to keep working until 80 if they want to and can. Municipalities around the country are also actively recruiting people over 60 to do lighter duties at nursing homes.\n\nIt's one way of dealing with the problem. Meanwhile, researchers are working on robots that can lift the elderly out of beds and wheelchairs, and inward-looking Japan is slowly coming around to the idea that it may need to allow in more foreign workers.\n\nAlthough older workers have constraints - some can't do the heavier tasks - they also offer advantages over younger workers who want time off for their children, said Yokoo, who is 41.\n\n\"Plus, because they're close in age to the residents, they can relate to each other more,\" she said. \"We younger people think this must be nice for them. Older staff can understand things like physical pains more because they are living through the same things.\"\n\nSome of the older workers here are doing it because they need the money. For others, the money is a nice benefit, but the main motivation is the activity and sense of community.\n\nKiyoko Tsuboi, a 95-year-old who comes into the rest home during the day, said she likes having Odaira around.\n\n\"He's very attentive to our needs and knows things like how hot we like our tea. My son is not as kind as Odaira-san,\" Tsuboi said as Odaira cleared away the lunch dishes. \"He's quite active despite his age, and even though he's a man, he has an eye for detail.\"\n\nThe dynamic works well for Odaira, too, who started here 17 years ago after retiring from his job in the sales department of an auto parts maker. He works eight hours a day, four days a week.\n\nHis father died when he was small, his mother when he was 22. \"It's not like I'm replacing my mother, but I thought I could help someone else's parents,\" he said.\n\nHe also does it to stay young, Odaira said with a twinkle in his eye. \"I think it's good for me physically and mentally, so as long as I can keep working, I will.\"\n\nHe's not the oldest worker here, though. That title is shared by two 78-year-olds, a man who works in the office, and Noriko Fukuju, who helps with pickups and drop-offs and does activities with \"the old people.\"\n\n\"It's fun. I enjoy it,\" she said.\n\nHiroko Akiyama, at the University of Tokyo's Institute of Gerontology, said a Japanese 65-year-old is in much better physical and mental shape than a 65-year-old a few decades ago. \"They are full of energy, and healthy and long-living,\" she said.\n\nAkiyama's research has found that working helps keep seniors that way. \"They operate on a regular schedule. They wake up, get ready, go to work and talk to people and stay connected,\" she said. \"We had a depressed old woman who changed completely after she started working.\"\n\nStill, Japan can't rely solely on seniors or, potentially, robots to staff its nursing homes, where the need will only grow as the population ages, analysts say.\n\nJapan has agreements with Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines under which applicants who complete job training and pass a Japanese language test can work at a Japanese nursing home.\n\nBut if they want to stay beyond three years, they must pass a national caregiver's exam so difficult that 40 percent of Japanese applicants fail. Many Japanese also express concern about cultural differences.\n\nNext year, the Japanese government will loosen the regulations slightly and set up a technical intern program, but there will still be time limits and difficult tests to pass.\n\nPerhaps 2,000 people will come to Japan through the intern program, said Yasuhiro Yuki, an expert on elderly care at Shukutoku University. \"But we hear we will need 300,000 more caregivers in the next 10 years,\" he said. \"So I still don't think we will have enough.\"\n\nThat means aging caregivers will increasingly become the norm.\n\n\"I can do this at least for two more years,\" said Fukuju, the 78-year-old, before she dashed out the door to renew her driver's licence.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Anna Fifield"},"topics":[{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Staff in rest homes as grey as the residents","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Stuff.co.nz","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662685","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Stuff.co.nz","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197039424","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:46Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/g/x/0/t/v/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.620x349.1gx0b5.png/1485675166369.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It was done to determine whether youth perceive corruption as harmful to the society. \n \nAccording to Harrison, the majority of youth surveyed said that the greatest arm of corruption was towards the development of business and the economy. \n \nOther key findings showed that 43.7 per cent of the respondents were exposed to behaviour deemed corrupt to avoid a particular problem. In addition, 40.4 per cent agreed that telling the truth is not valued in Jamaica, while 38.8 per cent witnessed persons engaged in corrupt activities to get out of trouble at home. \n \nThe contractor general argued that it is even more critical that youngsters are sensitised to the negative impacts of corruption from very early as 30 per cent were exposed at school and 20 per cent engaged in some corrupt activity to pass an exam. \n \nOn the other hand, 70 per cent agreed that lottery scamming was harmful to the Jamaican society. \n urgent interventions  \nHe said that urgent interventions are required if the country is to break the cycle among young people as once this is achieved, there will be exponential growth and development. \n \n\"As the experts indicated, it is no different from what the adults think. So if our children think this way, then we can understand why we are in the hole we are in. It is something for serious consideration,\" said Harrison. \n \nHe stressed the significance of collaboration among stakeholders, noting that corruption is a serious issue that can further stifle development. \n \n\"We at the Office of the Contractor General (OCG) have maintained our independence. We have executed our functions, I believe, and we are convinced that it is impossible for the office to truly execute its mandate without the participation of the Jamaican citizenry, the public, the private sector, and most importantly, our international partners,\" Harrison said. \n \n\"It is my firm my belief that in order for us to move forward, we need to consider that the OCG must be pivotal to the fight against corruption in Jamaica. It's important to note that no one agency can single-handedly tackle corruption. \n \n\"It requires all state actors and non-actors. It requires resources and effective coordination in areas of information sharing and intelligence gathering,\" added Harrison. \n \nJamaica was placed at 83 out of 176 countries on the annual Corruption Perception Index released last Tuesday by Transparency International. \n \nThis reflects a drop of a nominal 14 places when compared to last year and showed the country scoring 39 out of 100, down from 41 last year. Countries scoring less than 50 on the index are deemed to have a serious corruption problem.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jodi-Ann Gillpin"},"topics":[{"name":"Jamaica news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Casual on corruption - Contractor general alarmed as survey finds youth accepting corrupt activities as normal","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Jamaica Gleaner","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169811126","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"58"},"name":"Jamaica Gleaner","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197040026","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

All age groups are invited to participate, and the festival also signifies the unification of the Yorubas throughout the world. Tradition holds that Ile-Ife is the cradle of civilisation, the city of survivors, the spiritual seat of the Yorubas, and the land of the ancients. \n \nWe arrived at Lagos airport and travelled six hours to Ile-Ife through a town called Ede. We finally arrived at the palace around 4 p.m. \n \nHis Imperial Majesty's several days of prayerful seclusion communing with the ancestors on behalf of his people had just ended, and though he wasn't ready for public appearance, he welcomed us. \n \nThis ritual ensured his purity and the efficacy of his prayers. Before the Ooni emerged, women from his maternal and paternal families swept the palace, symbolising the removal of evil. \n \nLater, the Ooni would appear in public with the Aare crown (King's Crown), said to be the original crown used by Oduduwa. He led a procession of traditional chiefs and priests to perform rituals at the Shrine of Ogun. \n \nThe crowd was then led to Okemogun's shrine, where the king performed rituals that included the renewal of oath and divination at the foot of Oketage hill by Araba (chief priests). Visiting places of historical importance followed. \n \nThroughout the day, there was something magical about the atmosphere. I vividly recall the swarming crowds that made it impassable for vehicles. \n \nThousands of people, shoulder-to-shoulder, anxiously awaited the emergence of the king. \n \nDrums were talking in rhythm, a score of bare-chested young men with their heads half-shaved and their faces painted in white and red were marching back and forth through the crowd, whipping long sticks in the air to keep the crowd from stepping into the pathway that had been cleared for the King's passage. \n talking drums  \nAbout 30 minutes later, we heard the rapid succession of the talking drums and a high-pitch chanting in Yoruba, honouring the king. \n \nThe energy never ebbed. It was palpable, becoming volcanic when we spotted the tip of the colourfully beaded sacred crown, 'Aare,' said to house a spiritual deity that can only be seen once a year. \n \nAs customary, upon viewing the crown, spectators made a wish, hoping that it would be granted. This explained why thousands of Ife indigenes had camped out for days to catch a glimpse of the crown and their beloved king. \n \nThey were all praying in solemnity with the hope of having their solemn prayers answered. As a Nigerian with unswerving belief in the traditions, I bowed my head and made by wish. \n \nAs the king walked along the clear path, guarded closely by his traditional men know as 'Emese,' the crowds surged. All I remembered was being shuffled along. There was no room to look left, right, or down. \n \nThe crowd reminded me of the West Indian Day Parade in New York, but purpose and intention were different. There is an indescribable sacredness to the Olojo Festival that should be experienced by Yoruba people in the diaspora. It is an experience like no other. \n \nBukola Shonuga and Dr Glenville Ashby are independent journalists and members of the United States Foreign Press. \n \nn Dr Glenville Ashby can contacted at glenvilleashby@gmail.com and is the author of 'Anam Cara: Your Soul Friend', and 'Bridge to Enlightenment and Creativity'.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Dr Glenville Ashby"},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"The majesty of an Olojo Festival","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Jamaica Gleaner","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169811126","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"58"},"name":"Jamaica Gleaner","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197040322","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That, along with career-high scoring games from Clavell (37) and Emmanuel Omogbo (24), was too much for sputtering San Diego State to overcome. \n \nThe Aztecs have beaten the Rams 13-straight times at home, their longest active run against anyone. But that streak was snapped as Colorado State won its third straight and prevailed in San Diego for the first time since 2003. \n \n\u201cIt means a lot because we haven\u2019t won here in over 10 years,\u201d said Omogbo, who had a game-high nine rebounds. \u201cFor us to do it, and the way we won, it was crazy.\u201d \n \nAll because Clavell, who banked in a 3-pointer to put the Rams up by four with 80 seconds left, seized the moment with his aggressive move through the lane. \n \n\u201c(Dakari) Allen tried to reach in a little bit so I put it a little between my legs,\u201d Clavell said. \u201cI knew (Malik) Pope wasn\u2019t going to stay with (Omogbo) so when he reached in I just threw it up against the backboard and thanks to God it went in.\u201d \n \nTrey Kell sank two free throws with 11 seconds left to give the Aztecs the lead before Clavell\u2019s game-winner. \n \n\u201cYou saw a tremendously entertaining, hard-fought, big-time, Division I game,\u201d Aztecs coach Steve Fisher said. \u201cIf you\u2019re an Aztec player, coach or fan, you feel as if a part of you has been ripped off.

We feel we have the talent to win these close games no matter who we are playing.\u201d \n \nThe game had nine lead changes and was tied 10 times. The unlikely ending made for some confused reactions. \n \n\u201cHalf their guys didn\u2019t shake our hands and half our guys didn\u2019t shake their hands because everyone was just stunned,\u201d Eustachy said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t out of disrespect; these two programs have the most respect for each other as anyone in the conference. But I was sitting there going, \u2018What just happened?\u2019 \n \nPope scored a season-high 19 points and Hemsley added 17 to pace San Diego State, which missed its final four field goals over the last 3:11. \n \nBOXSCORE: Colorado St. 78, San Diego St. 77 \n \nBut it was clear the two best players on the floor were Clavell and Omogbo. \n \n\u201cWhen you have two special players you\u2019ve always got a chance to win,\u201d Eustachy said. \u201cGian just took over. Then Emmanuel took over. But everything had to fall right for us to win that game.\u201d \n \nOmogbo converted all four of his 3-pointers. Clavell missed but two of his six shots behind the arch, although he took some good-natured ribbing for his straightaway 3-pointer off the glass. \n \n\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anything,\u201d said Clavell, who added eight rebounds. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I had or where I was. It was a weird feeling, but it was good. And that was a good win.\u201d \n \nBIG PICTURE \n \nColorado State: The Rams have won three straight since losing two in a row by double digits. Colorado State remains in a second-place tie in the Mountain West Conference with Boise State, and both are a game back of Nevada. \n \nSan Diego State: The Aztecs got forward Malik Pope back on Saturday, after he sustained a scary injury on Tuesday.

However, Sania was broken in the seventh game which allowed the rivals to neutralise the advantage. \n \nThe Indian committed a double fault to be down by two breakpoints and Spears smashed one overhead volley to convert the first. Spears held without fuss and the two pairs were now locked 4-4. \n \nDodig was never in his elements in Sunday\u2019s match and he served two double faults, the second one coming on a breakpoint, to allow Cabal to serve out the championship. \n \nPTI","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Australian Open: Sania Mirza-Ivan Dodig fall at the final hurdle","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Siasat Daily","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169680243","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"Siasat Daily","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.siasat.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197044347","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sania-Mirza-Lvan.jpeg"}],"video":[]}}

During his final years as an archaeologist with the Army Corps of Engineers, he headed two MIA recovery missions \u2014one to Vietnam and one to Laos \u2014 both based out of Hickam Air Force Base. Honolulu became his second home during that time. There is no better traveling companion than an anthropologist who is familiar with a place, its people and culture. \n \nBoth states would probably tie when asked which has the friendliest people or the most breathtaking scenery. As West Virginia develops our tourism industry, we could take a few tips from Hawaii, since tourism is now the major source of state income, drawing billions of dollars a year in visitor expenditures. Tourism-related industries like hotels, transportation, retail shops and restaurants have grown to provide more than 150,000 jobs for the state economy. \n \nTourism has gradually replaced traditional agriculture as the primary income provider. Last year, after 180 years, the sugar industry shut down in Hawaii. Acreage once used for sugar production is now being converted to smaller crops and a variety of agricultural uses including community garden parks where residents can grow their own food. \n \nAgriculture still remains important to the economy of Hawaii and West Virginia, but it has become more diversified. We often think about crops like sugarcane, pineapple, macadamia nuts and coffee when we think about Hawaii. However, Hawaii now concentrates on specialized crops, which include ginger, onions, sweet potatoes and lettuce. \n \nTo promote agricultural diversification, the West Virginia Department of Agriculture and West Virginia State University Extension have been researching and reviving many of the plant and animal industries that were once a part of our state\u2019s rich and booming agricultural history, including white potatoes, sweet potatoes, hops and apples. \n \nWest Virginia\u2019s departments of Commerce and Agriculture are now promoting the state\u2019s agritourism industry. We could learn a thing or two from Hawaii, which hosted the first international AgriTourism Symposium at the College of Hawaiian Language: Ka Haka \u2018Ulu O Ke\u2019eliko Lani, in Hilo, this year. \n \nIndustry experts shared forecasts, trends and tips on competing on a global stage. Visitors from many regions of the world shared their experiences and perspectives on how they have expanded agricultural operations in innovative ways to increase profitability. \n \nFarmers in West Virginia and Hawaii have opportunities to connect agriculture with travel and tourism that impact many businesses beyond lodging and restaurants. Agritourism gives farmers, small producers and home-based businesses a chance to be creative and enlarge their own operations. \n \nFarmers are recognizing the financial benefits of adding an agritourism component to their marketing plan, because visitors are looking for different experiences that connect them to food sources. Small farms become profitable and sustainable as a result. \n \nMany chefs in West Virginia and Hawaii showcase regional cuisine, capitalizing on fresh, local and culturally inspired dishes. They support and source ingredients from small farms and identify the growers. Both states have farmers market associations that promote a rural lifestyle and agricultural products. \n \nPeter Merriman is considered the big kahuna of farm-driven restaurants in Hawaii. He started a restaurant in Waimea and now has five eateries on three Hawaiian Islands. When he started 25 years ago, he had trouble finding fresh local fruits and vegetables. \n \nHe had to encourage growers to plant the items he needed. Farmers complied and grew niche crops, many items never grown before. As tourism increased, farmers and restaurateurs realized a profit since there was a market for higher-quality foods. \n \nWest Virginia chef Dale Hawkins is most often accredited with building enthusiasm for the state\u2019s regional cuisine. While executive chef at Stonewall Resort, he innovatively combined provincial fare with ethnically inspired dishes, creating a new Appalachian cuisine, putting West Virginia on the epicurean map. \n \nDuring a cooking demonstration at the Feast of Seven Fishes, in Fairmont, another farm-to-table crusader, Chef Marion Ohlinger, of Morgantown\u2019s Hill and Hollow Restaurant, spoke about the immigrants who came to West Virginia to work in the steel and mining industries. Unable to find the ingredients for the recipes they brought from their home countries, newcomers improvised using local ingredients. \n \nFresh water fish were substituted for baccala and Bloody Butcher cornmeal was used to make polenta. He noted there were many occasions when local ingredients were used to create global flavors. \n \nThe same was true with immigrants in Hawaii. Ethnic cuisine was adapted to use fruits and vegetables from backyard gardens. Un-ripe mangos were combined with coconut milk to make chutney. As a result, a cosmopolitan/fusion cuisine evolved. \n \nToday, Hawaii and West Virginia are witnessing culinary innovations started by pioneering chefs. They looked at classic cuisine for inspiration to create imaginative, exhilarating new dining experiences. \n \nHome cooks can learn a lot from these pioneers. It is important to support local producers and the state\u2019s economy by using more fresh ingredients. And don\u2019t be afraid to improvise when a particular ingredient is not available. \n \nSusan Maslowski founded and operates the Mud River Pottery studio in Milton, where she has created utilitarian ware for nearly 40 years. She sells produce at the Putnam Farmers Market, serves on the board of the West Virginia Farmers Market Association and The Wild Ramp, and is an advocate for local foods and farmers. She also writes the Farmer\u2019s Table cooking column for the Gazette-Mail\u2019s Metro section. Susan can be reached by email at mudriverpottery@aol.com . \n Kalua Pork with Shiitake Sauce  \nHawaii and West Virginia have both developed renewed interest in heritage breed pigs, raised the old-fashioned humane and environmentally responsible way in the idyllic conditions of both states.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report. \n \nTM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n   \nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n   \nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \n   \nFAIRFAX, VIRGINIA \n   \nDozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. \n   \nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. \n   \nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n   \nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday. \n   \nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n   \nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n   \nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n   \nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" \n   \nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n   \nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition. \n   \nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n   \nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \n   \nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n   \n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n   \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n   \n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n   \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n   \n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" \n   \nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. \n   \nPORTLAND, OREGON \n   \nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\" \n   \nLOS ANGELES \n   \nAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil. \n   \nAvriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis. \n   \nSAN FRANCISCO \n   \nHundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport's international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. \n   \nAs motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Montgomery","zipCode":"45409","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dayton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Dayton Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657408","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2716"},"name":"Dayton Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.daytondailynews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197060073","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She owns a comparatively humble semi at Northbridge, in her Willoughby electorate. Photo: Daniel Munoz \n    exit   \nSydney's booming spring property market has delivered the new Berejiklian government a budget windfall. \n \nThe amount of residential stamp duty flowing into the state coffers hit new monthly records in November and December, Office of State Revenue figures show. \n \nThe NSW government collected $730 million from the residential property transfers last month alone \u2013 about $100 million more than the previous December. November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier. \n \nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts. \n \nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July. \n \nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier. \n \nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016. \n \nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256. \n \nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years. \n \nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability. \n \nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\". \n \nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\". \n \nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year. \n \nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets. \n \nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16. \n \nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year. \n \nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion. \n \nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Blacktown Sun","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169699273","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Blacktown Sun","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.blacktownsun.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197071071","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We were wrong,\" the Secretary-General said. \"Irrationality and intolerance are back.\"\n\nAddressing representatives from the 193 Member States gathered in the General Assembly Hall to mark the annual Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust, Mr. Guterres said that today anti-Semitism continues, alongside racism, xenophobia, anti-Muslim hatred and other forms of intolerance, triggered by populism and gaining ground in public discourse.\n\n'Dehumanization took hold and the descent into barbarity was quick'\n\nHe voiced his extreme concern at the discrimination faced by immigrants, refugees and minorities across the world, particularly the stereotyping of Muslims, referring to how the Holocaust was allowed to spread: \"Hardships and instability created fertile groups for scapegoating.\"\n\nDrawing attention to the powerful exhibit now at UN Headquarters called 'State of Deception: The Power of Nazi Propaganda,' he said propaganda helped erode the bonds of humanity. The word \"Jewish\" was used constantly in association with society's ills. \"Ultimately indifference prevailed, dehumanization took hold, and the descent into barbarity was quick,\" he told those gathered at the ceremony, which this year focuses on educating for a better future.\n\nHistory created lessons for our time, Mr. Guterres said, urging the international community to be vigilant, invest in education and youth, and to strengthen social cohesion \"so that people feel that diversity is a plus, not a threat.\"\n\nIn addition to remembering the survivors and victims of the Holocaust, 27 January was adopted by the General Assembly to condemn any denial of the Holocaust and to urge all Member States unreservedly to reject any denial of the Holocaust.\n\nThe UN chief spoke personally about the history of Jews in his home country, Portugal, noting that anti-Semitism is \"more than a question of religion, [it] is essentially an expression of racism.\"\n\nMr. Guterres added proudly, his wife signed on behalf of the Lisbon Municipality, an agreement with the Israeli Community of Lisbon to establish the Lisbon Jewish Museum. \n\nAnnual General Assembly Commemoration\n\nToday's event in the General Assembly Hall started with recognition of the Holocaust survivors and Red Army veterans in attendance and a minute of silence for the millions of people killed in Europe in the years leading up to 1945. It featured soulful performances by Jewish singers and musicians, as well as a dramatic recitation of memorial prayers.\n\nThe ceremony also paid tribute to UN Messenger of Peace and Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel, who died last year.\n\nThe President of the General Assembly, Peter Thomson, began his remarks by quoting Mr. Wiesel, asking: \"'How does one mourn for fix million people who died? How many candles does one light? How many prayers does one recite?'\"\n\nMr. Thomson called for a rededication \"to learning the lessons of the past so that humanity may never repeat such atrocities in the future.\"\n\nHe called for education to teach the dangers of extremism, the importance of defending the vulnerable, and the need to stand up against racism and prejudice.\n\n\"Interfaith dialogue, respect for human rights, and the embracing of democratic and humanist values at the heart of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are central responsibilities for us all,\" Mr. Thomson said, in reference to the 17 targets aiming to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all.\n\n\"Young people must be taught the ethics and logic inherent in defending our common humanity, of preventing mass atrocity crimes, and of bringing perpetrators to justice,\" he added.\n\n'Those who could not keep rhythm were shot'\n\nThe keynote address was given by Noah Klieger. Born in 1926, Mr. Klieger, a survivor of Auschwitz, had founded a youth movement to help Jews cross the Swiss border and went on to become one of Israel's most notable journalists. He is today allegedly the oldest working journalist in the world.\n\nMr. Klieger, who travelled from Israel to participate in the ceremony, took the podium to a standing ovation. His grandson, seating nearby, reminded Mr. Klieger to speak English, to which the Holocaust survivor replied good humouredly, \"Why don't you all learn Hebrew.\"\n\nSpeaking about the Shoah, as the Holocaust is known in Hebrew, he talked about the last days of the war, when the Germans forced people from the Auschwitz camp to march to the border town of Gliwica.\n\n\"We had to march in a rhythm that nobody could keep. And those who could not keep the rhythm were shot. The roads were full of those who had been shot by DSS before they couldn't make it. Others just laid down,\" Mr. Klieger said, about the five-day death march that killed 41,000 by his estimates.\n\nIn a speech peppered with jokes and poignant remembrances, Mr. Klieger recounted his days in the camp. He spoke about three dreams that he never thought would be possible; the first of which was to be free.\n\nHe praised the value of education and the creation of the Holocaust and the UN Outreach Programme to teach people around the world about what took place, but added that \"one who has not lived through the German camps does not know about the German camps.\"\n\nHe called for the creation of a teaching programme in all schools around the world so that the horrors of the Holocaust are not repeated and to counter anti-Semitism.\n\nAmong other speakers today was Danny Danon, the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations. Calling the Holocaust \"the most devastating tragedy in history,\" Mr. Danon said it was a failure \"to recognize the warning signs of hatred and bigotry.\"\n\nThe Ambassador called on the UN to appoint a special envoy to combat anti-semitism so that the international community \"would never remain silent.\"\n\n\"It is our duty to work together to prevent extremism and violence by promoting tolerance, understanding and compassion,\" Mr. Danon said.\n\nBefore leaving the podium, the Ambassador vowed that \"anti-Semitism would not defeat us.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"John Pike"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Jewish news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Portugal news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"UN remembers Holocaust","source":{"category":"Organisation","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"GlobalSecurity.org","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169721557","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"91"},"name":"GlobalSecurity.org","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.globalsecurity.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197071575","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council. \n \nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet. \n \nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney. \n \nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families. \n \nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\". \n \nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections. \n \nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies. \n \nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\". \n \nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts. \n \nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state. \n \nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs. \n \nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean. \n \nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts. \n \nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation. \n \nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader. \n \nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres. \n \nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts. \n \nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities. \n \nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing. \n \nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence. \n \nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following  Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics  after being told she could not remain in the portfolio. \n \nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment. \n \nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance. \n \nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected. \n \nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\". \n \n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" \n \nThe story Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019 first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Blacktown Sun","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169699273","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Blacktown Sun","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.blacktownsun.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197073770","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP. \n \n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\" \n \n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said. \n \n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\" \n \nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\". \n \nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession. \n \nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\". \n \nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\". \n \nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister. \n \nThe story New counter terrorism role slammed as 'against the public interest' first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Terrorism news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"New counter terrorism role slammed as 'against the public interest'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Blacktown Sun","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169699273","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Blacktown Sun","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.blacktownsun.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197073936","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Therefore, it is business prudence to keep the number of variants at an optimum level in line with customers requirements.\" \n \nThe model's performance is in line with the company's expectation, the spokesperson added. \n \n\"We started a new segment called premium crossover with S Cross. Volume-wise, S-Cross continues to do an average of 2,000-2,100 units monthly,\" the spokesperson said. \n \nS-Cross, the first model from the stable of MSI to be sold through its premium retail chain NEXA, has had a chequered history. \n \nMSI had introduced the S-Cross in two options of 1.6 litre and 1.3 litre engines in 2015 coinciding with the launch of its premium retail outlet chain Nexa. However, pricing issues hindered sales of the vehicle forcing the company to go for price correction. \n \nLast year, the company had cut price of the vehicle by over Rs 2 lakh. The reduction in the price of 1.6 litre variant was Rs 2,05,000 for all the three trims, while that of 1.3 litre variant ranged from Rs 40,000 to Rs 66,000. \n \nS-Cross along with Vitara Brezza have helped the company enhance its market share in the utility vehicle (UV) segment. \n \nWhile Vitara Brezza has been a runaway hit, S-Cross has been a slow starter for the company. \n \nAcknowledging the fact, the spokesperson said: \"Every brand has a specific role in the overall portfolio. While some are mass models that sell in big numbers, others may not sell as much as a mass model but contribute to the overall brand objectives of the company for the medium and long term\". \n \nS-Cross helps Maruti Suzuki in expanding its range and presence with an eye on the future, the spokesperson added. \n \nGrowth in the UV segment for MSI is over 120 per cent for the April-December period this fiscal. Volume wise the company has sold 1,43,254 units during the April-December period as compared to 63,924 units in the previous fiscal. \n \nThe company now commands over 65 per cent market share in the total UV segment.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Maruti discontinues sale of lower variants of S-Cross","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Today India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"196774332","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Business Today India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://businesstoday.intoday.in"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197081939","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:45Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The order also gives Christian refugees priority in the resettlement process. \n \n\"If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians,\" Trump said in an interview with Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday. \n \n\"And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them,\" he said. \n \nAccording to a Pew Research Center report, the US has accepted nearly equal number of Muslim and Christian refugees in 2016. \n \nSeveral US airports were rocked by protests and arrests after the order was signed. \n \nTrump defends his decision, saying it a measure to \"keep radical Islamic terrorists\" out of America. \n \nGoogle's India-born CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg among others have criticised the new move. \n \n\"Like many of you, I'm concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump,\" Zuckerberg wrote on his","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Immigration ban includes green card holders: DHS","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Deccan Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673440","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"137"},"name":"Deccan Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197083064","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Under LaFleur and Shanahan, Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan had the most prolific season of his nine-year career and stands a very good chance of being named the league\u2019s MVP for 2016. \n\nRELATED: On 49ers: Kyle Shanahan\u2019s QB résumé shows versatility \n\nRELATED: On 49ers: Will new coach get \u2018the trigger\u2019 over new GM? \n\nLaFleur also spent four seasons in the same role in Washington working with Shanahan and Shanahan\u2019s father, Mike. Their most famous pupil at the time was then-rookie Robert Griffin III, who set a Washington rookie record in 2012 in passing yards (3,200). More significant now, LaFleur was on hand when Washington drafted and developed quarterback Kirk Cousins, someone the 49ers could pursue if he becomes an unrestricted free agent in March. Team officials in Washington, however, uniformly said this week that they want Cousins back for the 2017 season and could give him the franchise tag for the second straight year. \n\nLaFleur also worked under Kyle Shanahan in Houston in 2008 and 2009, when Shanahan was the Texans\u2019 offensive coordinator and LaFleur worked with the quarterbacks and receivers. \n\nBefore last week\u2019s NFC championship game, Fox News reported that the Falcons already had a list of possible replacements for Shanahan at offensive coordinator, including former 49ers head coach Chip Kelly. LaFleur also might be among candidates. If not, he could wind up as the 49ers\u2019 offensive coordinator. His brother, Mike, also is an offensive assistant in Atlanta and presumably would join Matt if he came to San Francisco. \n\nIt\u2019s unknown at this point whom the 49ers would hire as their defensive coordinator. The team pursued former Jaguars coach Gus Bradley, who joined the Chargers instead, and was told that former 49ers defensive coordinator Vic Fangio would not be allowed out of his contract in Chicago. Panthers defensive-line coach Eric Washington also has been discussed as a possibility. \n\nAs far as special teams, multiple sources have said Richard Hightower is could become the coordinator. Hightower, currently the Bears\u2019 assistant special-teams coach, in 2014 was an offensive quality control coach in Cleveland, where he worked under Shanahan, the Browns\u2019 offensive coordinator at the time. Hightower also was in Washington for four seasons under the Shanahans. \n\nHightower also served as an assistant to 49ers special-teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey in 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - San Francisco 49ers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Shanahan could bring two longtime lieutenants with him to 49ers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Merced","zipCode":"95340","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Merced","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Merced Sun-Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661579","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"15"},"name":"Merced Sun-Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["AmericanFootball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mercedsunstar.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.sacbee.com/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers/article127562049.html","http://www.sacbee.com/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers/article128726979.html"],"sequenceId":"695197087349","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

All but eight of FGCU's points came in the paint or at the free throw line.\n\nMorant (Miami, Fla./UNLV/Bishop rman HS) was an uber-efficient 11-14 from the field, including throwing down eight dunks - matching the entire number of field goals Jacksonville made as a team in the 2nd half. Dunk City - which is 3rd in the nation in field goal percentage at better than 51 percent - had a season-high 12 slams, energizing the crowd of 4,402.\n\nIn addition to Morant's career night, Brandon odwin (Norcross, Ga./UCF/Norcross HS)tallied 16 points and passed out a game-high seven assists, and Zach Johnson (Miami, Fla./Norland HS) netted 11 points and secured five rebounds.\n\nFGCU held just a 36-33 halftime lead as the Eagles allowed the Dolphins - who came into the game ranked 7th in the nation in 3-pointers made - to shoot 50 percent from beyond the arc in the opening 20 minutes. JU scored 31 of its 33 1st-half points from the 3-point line or free-throw line, while FGCU scored 34 of its 36 1st-half points in the paint or at the free-throw line.\n\nWhile Morant set the tone offensively for the Eagles, Kevin Mickle (Brooklyn, N.Y./Broward CC/CCSU/St. Benedict's Prep) set the tone defensively. After not playing at all in the 1st half, Mickle played 13 minutes in the 2nd half and arguably had the biggest impact in slowing the Dolphins' perimeter attack. After going 9-18 from 3-point range in the 1st half, JU went just 2-17 in the 2nd half.\n\nThe Eagles - who didn't make a 3-pointer in the 1st half - made two in the first four minutes of the 2nd half and opening the stanza on a 12-3 run and open up the game. From there, JU was only able to get as close as eight the rest of the way as the Eagles put on show to remain one game clear of USC Upstate and Lipscomb at the top of the ASUN standings.\n\n\"It was a slow start, and we did a good job of withstanding them making nine 3s in the 1st half,\" commented FGCU head coach Joe Dooley. \"We got it going in the 2nd half. Meech was obviously terrific, but I thought Kevin was the guy who got us energized at the defensive end. That's what we really needed. After that we played a lot better, even though we didn't shoot it great from 3-point range, but our defensive field goal percentage was solid.\"\n\nFGCU held Jacksonville - which came into the contest averaging 80.2 points per game - to a season-low point total, season-low field goal total (18) and season-low field goal percentage (32.7, 18-55).\n\nJ.R. Holder led the Dolphins with 21 points, while Cody Helgeland tallied 11 - nine of which came in the opening eight minutes of the contest. FGCU out-rebounded JU by 24 (50-26), with the 50 caroms representing a season high for the Eagles.\n\nFGCU would finish the game at 53.3 percent (32-60) from the floor, despite going just 2-17 (11.8 percent) from 3-point range. From 2-point range, the Eagles shot an incredible 70 percent (30-43).\n\nFGCU is now 69-13 (.841) at Alico Arena since the start of the 2012-13 season, including a 10-2 mark this year. In ASUN games, the Eagles are 31-4 (.886) against league foes in the regular season in that same timeframe.\n\nThe Eagles will remain at home when they welcome North Florida (9-15, 4-3 ASUN) on Monday, Jan. 30, for a 7 p.m. tipoff. The contest will be the second between the two sides in six days, with FGCU pulling out an 86-82 win in Jacksonville on Wednesday night.

At that time, sterling had been making some particularly strong gains. \n \nThe decision to cut the limit by £10,000 was previously described by commentators as \u201cbonkers\u201d and \u201cabsurd\u201d. \n \nIn November 2016, the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) announced a consultation on plans to restore the limit back up to £85,000, following falls in the pound, and the change was later confirmed. \n \nThe FSCS will protect deposits up to £85,000 in banks, building societies and credit unions. \n \nJoint accounts will also benefit from the increase, with a new limit of £170,000. \n \nA survey carried out in January for the FSCS found only one in seven (14%) people were aware their cash was getting greater protection. \n \nThe research, carried out among more than 2,000 people, also found two-thirds (66%) of people were in favour of the move \u2013 with support in Scotland, the West Midlands and the South East found to be particularly strong. \n \nA quarter (25%) of people also thought the increased limit would encourage them to save more. \n \nAnother survey, from peer-to-peer lender RateSetter, found 69% of savers would rather earn an extra percentage point in interest on their cash pots than have an extra £10,000 of FSCS protection. \n \nMark Neale, chief executive of the FSCS, said: \u201cThe limit increase will protect even more of people\u2019s savings.\u201d \n \nThe FSCS said the new £85,000 limit protects around 98% of people across the UK. Under the £75,000 limit, around 97% of people were protected. \n \nThe compensation limit is applied per banking authorisation \u2013 and some banking brands share an authorisation. \n \nThis means some savers may want to split their deposits out more widely among different firms, to prevent the total value of deposits they hold with a single firm going over the deposit protection limit. \n \nSavers can check whether their cash is fully protected by going to fscs.org.uk/protected.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Increase in deposit protection limit means extra security for savers\u2019 cash","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Dundee","zipCode":"DD1","state":"Scotland","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Dundee City","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tayside and Fife Courier","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661741","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"22"},"name":"Tayside and Fife Courier","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thecourier.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197091177","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He came back with bars... Altogether there must have been a bit more than 800 grammes.\" \n\nAlthough Kim admitted she feared for her life during the ordeal, Khedache insisted they treated her well, despite tying her up. \n\nHe said: \"We didn't take our weapons out in front of a woman. The person with me tied her up on the bed... I placed her in the bath.\" \n\nAnd Khedache admitted planning the robbery was easy, because Kim was so open about her movements and jewels on social media and he also claimed they had insider information. \n\nHe said: \"The jewels were shown on the internet, and (she said) that she didn't wear fakes... the time she would arrive in France, you just had to look at the internet and you knew everything, absolutely everything. \n\n\"We had very precise information about her movements that we got from someone who was very close to her.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"sunday.world@sundayworld.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Consumer: fashion news","group":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Kim Kardashian West's stolen jewels melted and sold","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"IE","country":"Ireland"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Sunday World Ireland","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170508679","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"12"},"name":"Sunday World Ireland","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sundayworld.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197092231","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://darkroom.sundayworld.com/800/0/f1337b370fd4adc5099452f8c51a195b:7313b6190890d76e50d0eda5cfee80bf/"}],"video":[]}}

I see it as a miracle. Trust me, I can still moan like the rest them but, equally, I remind myself every day that this is an absolute gift.\" \n \nAnd Geri, who battled bulimia when she was younger, insisted that she will not be a \"fanatic\" about losing the baby weight. \n \nShe said: \"When it comes to losing my baby weight I am not going to be a fanatic about it. At the moment the stairs in my house are exercise enough. Trust me, I have been there, done it, with all that perfect clean eating, but sometimes it is not sustainable or manageable. \n \n\"For a long time now I have tried to have a balanced attitude towards food and dieting. I am like any other woman, I'll scoff a few chocolates and then I'll think, 'Ooh, I'd better keep an eye on that.' But the important thing to me is trying to give yourself a break and say, \"It's OK to have the chocolate and eat the cake, just find a balance.\" \n \n\"I think that restriction tends to lead you in the opposite direction and you just want more. I used to have so much restriction around food. Now I find if I allow myself to have a bit, I am less likely to overindulge. \n \nGeri also has a 10-year-old daughter Bluebell with her ex Sacha Gervasi and revealed that the youngster keeps her so busy she didn't have time to worry about getting everything ready for the new baby. \n \nShe explained: \"Only as my birth began to get close did I start to think about the reality of it, the preparation, the practical things, getting a nursery ready, and the things that one needs. But to be honest, as a mother to a 10-year-old already, I was thinking more about things like, \"Has my daughter done her homework?'\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Consumer: womens news","group":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Geri Halliwell's miracle pregnancy","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"SG","country":"Singapore"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Toggle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"578707180","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Toggle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://entertainment.toggle.sg"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197093461","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Without funds for an attorney, I accepted deferred probation. It has followed me my entire life. \n \nI graduated from college, law, and graduate school, yet I had to endure a hearing to ascertain my fitness to practice. It also caused employment rejection. \n \nLater, as assistant county attorney in El Paso, and elected district attorney in Willacy County, I routinely dismissed pot cases. Prosecutor\u2019s offices have limited budgets, yet mountains of cases. Dismissing marijuana offenses, allowed me to send more dangerous criminals to prison. \n \nEven probation for pot was wasteful. Curfews and reporting requirements should be for prowlers and burglars, not pot smokers. \n \nThis problem persists, as 620,000 Americans were arrested for pot last year. Yes, illegal marijuana creates jobs for probation officers, prosecutors, bailiffs, chemists, clerical staff and many more; however taxpayers get soaked. \n \nCalifornia and three other states legalized marijuana on Nov. 8. Voters were persuaded by the Colorado experience, where $2.4 billion in revenues and 17,000 jobs were created in legalization\u2019s first year. Some of this boom comes from visiting Texans. \n \nThe Denver Post polled, \u201cWould you repeal legalization?\u201d The answer; \u201cNo\u201d, by a 51 percent to 36 percent margin. Gallup\u2019s 2016 poll showed support for legalization has grown to 60 percent nationally, and recent studies demonstrate no increased use among youngsters since legalization. Colorado is booming, and other states want what they\u2019re smoking. \n \nThe old \u201cReefer Madness\u201d arguments against marijuana have been dispelled. Today\u2019s legalization opponents such as Insys Therapeutics, which develops synthetic painkillers, poured $500,000 into the \u201cNo\u201d vote in Arizona. It\u2019s these legal painkillers which cause so much addiction and harm. \n \nPrescription drugs increase our health costs and Big Pharma doesn\u2019t want competition. The Catholic Church was also a huge contributor, with the Boston Archdiocese donating $850,000 to oppose Massachusetts\u2019 marijuana initiative. \n \nOne lingering anti-pot argument is that people will ingest and drive. This happens anyway and it will be illegal everywhere. \n \nNot satisfied, opponents wonder how they will test for marijuana. Field tests still work, but how about we just arm each officer with a chocolate bar, and they could cuff the stoned drivers as they grab for it. \n \nLegalization will come eventually, as it\u2019s only the oldest age groups who are opposed. \n \nAn estimated 15 million Americans use marijuana regularly, and about half our population has admitted trying marijuana. \n \nMarijuana decriminalization bills for the 2017 Texas Legislature, have been filed, including one by El Paso\u2019s own Joe Moody. \n \nRepublicans are increasingly in favor, because of the fiscal benefits and individual freedom arguments. Democrats are already there, and almost everyone wants to decrease the power of the violent drug cartels who smuggle pot across our border. \n \nLet\u2019s legalize it, and have Mexico put up the wall to keep Texans from trafficking marijuana into their country. \n \nEl Paso attorney Steve Fischer has been a professor of criminology and a Texas State Bar director.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 10 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"40202","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Louisville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Louisville Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"540"},"name":"Louisville Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197095477","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Kings","zipCode":"11205","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Brooklyn","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bed-Stuy Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172081245","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Bed-Stuy Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bed-stuy.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695197095682","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2428","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Forster","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Great Lakes Advocate","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170633411","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Great Lakes Advocate","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.greatlakesadvocate.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197102306","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley may hike service tax rate to 16-18 per cent from the current 15 per cent in the Budget, due on Wednesday, as a precursor to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout. The move, that will make flying, eating out, phone bills and a host of other services expensive, would be an attempt to take the rates closer to the proposed tax slabs for GST. GST, which will subsume central and state levies like excise duty, service tax and VAT, is scheduled to be rolled out from July 1. The tax slabs decided for the GST are 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent and taking service tax closer to one of the slabs is a logical move in the Budget, tax experts said. Tax experts say, Jaitley, who had in his previous budget hiked service tax rate by 0.5 per cent to 15 per cent, may raise the levy by at least one percentage point to 16 per cent. Some others feel there could be different service tax rates with a lower 12 per cent for basic services and a higher 18 per cent for the rest. Also, a higher service tax for April-June will help the government garner more revenue to meet expenses on schemes and programmes it may be planning to contain the impact of demonetisation.\n\nA service tax rate closer to the GST rate will also help consumers avoid a greater price shock when the new national sales tax is rolled out. While service tax until now is a central levy, it will be equally split between the Centre and states under the new GST regime. Most services, except essential ones like primary healthcare and basic education, will be covered by GST. Service tax was budgeted to provide Rs 2.31 lakh crore in 2016-17, more than 14 per cent of the Centre\u2019s total tax revenues of Rs 16.30 lakh crore.\n\nThis will be the third time that Jaitley will raise service tax rate. Service tax from June 1, 2015 was hiked from 12.36 per cent to 14 per cent. A 0.5 per cent Swachh Bharat Cess was levied on all services, taking the total incidence of service tax to 14.5 per cent from November 15, 2015. In the last Budget, he imposed a Krishi Kalyan Cess at the rate of 0.5 per cent on all taxable services to take the levy to 15 per cent.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Telecom news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Tax news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Union Budget 2017: Service tax to be hiked to 16-18%; eating out, phone bills to be costlier","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Indian Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660698","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"Indian Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197105077","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:29:56Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/arun-jaitley-copy.jpg?w=450"},{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/arun-jaitley-copy.jpg?w=480"}],"video":[]}}

So complicated and confusing to please,\u201d she wrote, questioning men on her list. \n \n\u201cIf you try to please them, you are cheap; if you make love to them you are a love peddler; if you don\u2019t, you are playing hard to get; if you show them love you are too emotional. If you give them attention, you are bugging them, and if you don\u2019t, you are with other men. If you dress sexy you are attracting other men, if you don\u2019t, you are awkward and local. If you cook; wash their clothes, you are desperate of getting married, if you don\u2019t , you are not a wife material\u201d \n \nContinuing: \u201cIf you\u2019re independent you are chasing other men; if you are dependent you are a liability. If you try to satisfy them in bed you are a sex addict; if you don\u2019t, you are making sex boring. If you get pregnant you want to trap them down; if you don\u2019t, you have damaged your womb. If you are beautiful, you can\u2019t stay with one man; if you are not, you are not up to the standard; if you ask for money you are too demanding and if you don\u2019t, you are forming\u201d. Then, she hits the nail on the head, \u201cthey think we can\u2019t do without them. At times, I don\u2019t think they know what they want\u201d. \n \nThe post appeared first on Vanguard News . \n \nOriginal Article \n \nMen Think You Are A Sex Addict When You Satisfy Them In Bed \u2014 Bridget Amos \nMen Think You Are A Sex Addict When You Satisfy Them In Bed \u2014 Bridget Amos \nMen Think You Are A Sex Addict When You Satisfy Them In Bed \u2014 Bridget Amos \nMen Think You Are A Sex Addict When You Satisfy Them In Bed \u2014 Bridget Amos \nMen Think You Are A Sex Addict When You Satisfy Them In Bed \u2014 Bridget Amos \n Men Think You Are A Sex Addict When You Satisfy Them In Bed \u2014 Bridget Amos  Men Think You Are A Sex Addict When You Satisfy Them In Bed \u2014 Bridget Amos","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Men think you are a sex addict when you satisfy them in bed \u2014 Bridget Amos","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Ondo State News Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608959245","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Ondo State News Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://ondostatenews.online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/01/men-think-sex-addict-satisfy-bed-bridget-amos/","http://www.vanguardngr.com/"],"sequenceId":"695197105867","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

You will agree with me that sports is a strong unifying force in Nigeria. No matter your religion, culture and political affiliation, the moment there is sporting activities or a competition everybody becomes one. But here in Edo, that unifying force has been completely annihilated by the past administration of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. \n \nLook, you do not need a prophet to tell you that sports in this state has become moribund. It is very important for us to voice out our feelings so that this present government will not \n \nmake the same mistakes that its predecessor made in the area of sports development. \n \nFor Edo State to regain her past glory in sports in Nigeria, our governor must do the needful. A man who knows what sports administration is all about must and should be appointed as head of the sports ministry in the state. \n \nWithout prejudice, some of the past commissioners, especially the immediate past one, was a monumental failure, a disaster and in fact we have never had it so bad. This is why we are begging our governor to appoint someone with a sound resume to manage the Ministry so that Edo State will assume her rightful position in the Nigerian sports calendar. \n \n\u201cOn my own part, I want to appeal to the governor to look into our condition of service. 80% percent of us have not been promoted for the past 16 years.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n\nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n\n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n\n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n\n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n\nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n\nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n\nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n\nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n\nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n\nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n\nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n\nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n\nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n\nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n\nReleased under special circumstances \n\nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n\nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n\n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n\nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n\nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n\nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n\nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n\n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n\n'The executive order is unlawful' \n\nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n\nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n\n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n\nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n\n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n\nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n\nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n\n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq.

It is caused by a virus that lives in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person. Only humans spread the measles virus, no other animal species is known to spread or habour measles. It is a vaccine preventable disorder, yet continues to afflict children around the world. \n \nThe measles virus that attacks the respiratory tract is one of the most contagious diseases known. Children are especially vulnerable to measles and 350 die from it every day globally despite the availability of a safe, effective and affordable vaccine. Measles survivors are often left with life-long disabilities, such as blindness, deafness or brain damage. \n \nMeasles is an endemic disease, meaning it is continually present in a community and many people develop resistance. However, if measles enters an area where the people have never been exposed, the result can be devastating. \n \nHow it is transmitted \n \nMeasles virus is highly contagious. It can spread through coughing and sneezing and can live for up to two hours in airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed. If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90 percent of the people close by will also become infected if they are not immune. Infected persons can spread measles to others from four days before through four days after the rash appears. \n \nMeasles rash & Koplik spots \n \nThe infection starts with fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes, and sore throat. Three to five days after symptoms begin, a rash breaks out. It usually begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and spread downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet. Small raised bumps may also appear on top of the flat red spots. Two or three days after symptoms begin, tiny white spots (Koplik spots) may appear inside the mouth. The fever may spike to more than 104° Fahrenheit. After a few days, the fever subsides and the rash fades. \n \nSymptoms \n \nMeasles symptoms can often include a reddish-brown spotty rash but usually include fever and at least one of the three C\u2019s \u2013 cough, coryza (runny nose), and conjunctivitis. Symptoms will appear about 9-11 days after initial infection. \n \nFever \u2013 this may be mild to severe and can reach 40.6 degrees Centigrade for a number of days. Fever may drop and then rise again when the rash appear. Although the majority of childhood rashes are not measles, a child should be taken to the doctors if it is suspected that it could be measles. \n \nSuspicion is stronger if symptoms do not improve, or get worse, or the fever rises to above 38 degrees Centigrade and other symptoms have resolved except for fever. Symptoms of measles can include watery eyes, sneezing, and a dry hacking cough. It takes 1-3 weeks for the measles virus to establish itself. There is no specific treatment for measles; prevention is better than cure. Pregnant women should not take the vaccine. \n \n\n \nHow infection develops \n \nAs soon as the virus enters the body, it multiplies in the back of the throat, lungs, and the lymphatic system. It later infects and replicates in the urinary tract, eyes, blood vessels, and central nervous system. Experts say it takes 1-3 weeks for the virus to establish itself. However, people show symptoms 9-11 days after acquiring the infection. \n \nA person who has had measles before does not become infected again; cases of re-infection are very rare. However, anyone who has never been infected or vaccinated that breathes in infected droplets or is in close physical contact with an infected person is likely to become ill. Approximately 90 percent of people who are not immune will develop measles if they share the same house with an infected person. \n \nDiagnosis \n \nA doctor will be able to diagnose measles fairly easily if the signs and symptoms are present. A blood test will confirm the presence of the virus. In Nigeria measles is a notifiable disease. This means that doctors have to notify the authorities of any suspected cases. If the patient is a child, the doctor will also notify the school. A child with measles should not return to school until at least 5 days after the rash has appeared. \n \nTreatment \n \nThere is no specific measles treatment. If there are no complications, the doctor will recommend plenty of rest and normal measures to control the fever and prevent dehydration (drink fluids). Symptoms will usually go away within 7-10 days. If a child has measles, the following measures may help: \n \nFever \u2013 if the temperature is high, the child should be kept cool, but not too cold. Paracetamol or acetaminophen are effective in controlling fever, as well as aches and pain. Children under 16 should not be given aspirin. \n \nPhotophobia \u2013 as the child may be sensitive to light, keeping the lights dim or the room darkened may help. Sunglasses may also help. \n \nConjunctivitis \u2013 if there is crustiness around the eyes, gently clean with a warm, damp cloth. \n \nCough \u2013 cough medicines will not relieve the cough. If the child is over 12, a glass of warm water with a teaspoon of lemon juice and two teaspoons of honey may help. Do not give honey to infants. \n \nDehydration \u2013 make sure the child is hydrated. If a child has a fever, he can become dehydrated more quickly. Encourage the child to drink plenty of fluids. \n \nIsolation \u2013 during the contagious stage, infected children should be kept away from school and should not return to activities that involve human interaction. Non-immunized people who have never had measles should be isolated. \n \nVitamin A supplements \u2013 significantly help prevent complications caused by measles. Supplements are recommended for children with vitamin A deficiency and children under the age of 2 who have severe measles. As measles is caused by a virus, antibiotics will not have any effect on it. However, antibiotics may sometimes be prescribed for any additional bacterial infections that develop. \n \nComplications \n \nComplications from measles are fairly common and are more likely to be worse for patients who have weak immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or leukemia, those with vitamin deficiency, and very young children. Adults over the age of 20 are more likely to have complications than healthy children over the age of 5. \n \nThe complications can include diarrhoea, vomiting, eye infection, laryngitis and bronchitis, Otitis media, Febrile seizure and Pneumonia. Hepatitis, Encephalitis \u2013 approximately 1 in every 1,000 patients with measles develops encephalitis and Thrombocytopenia among others. \n \nMeasles during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, premature labor, or low birth weights. If an individual is planning on getting pregnant and has not been vaccinated against measles, they should speak with their doctor. \n \nVaccine protection \n \nIn the decade before 1963 when a measles vaccine became available, nearly all children in the world had measles infection by the time they were 15 years of age. Measles vaccine is usually combined with mumps and rubella vaccines, hence the name Measles, Mumps & Rubella or MMR vaccine. The World Health Organization recommends that children should receive two doses of MMR, the first dose at 12 through 15 months of age and the second dose at 4 through six years of age. The MMR vaccine is very safe and effective and the best way to protect children and prevent them from spreading the disease to others. The success of measles vaccination has been dramatic. \n \nPeople who have already had measles are immune and will not get it again \u2013 cases of re-infection are extremely rare. For people who are not immune, there is the measles vaccine. \n \nWhen should children be vaccinated? \n \nChildren should receive the MMR vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age, and then again (a booster) before entering school when they are 4-6 years old. Babies carry their mother\u2019s immunity for a few months after birth if their mothers are immune. Sometimes babies require vaccination before they are 12 months old. This may happen if there is a serious outbreak in their area, or if they are going to travel to an area with a serious outbreak. In such cases, they can receive the vaccination from the age of 6 months and will need a booster when they are 12 months old. \n \nProgress against measles has been significant. UNICEF and its partners have successfully vaccinated 1.8 billion children worldwide since 2000, helping global death rates to plummet by 79 per cent and saving more than 20 million young lives. But it remains deadly \u2013 some 360 children still die every day from the disease, which attacks the respiratory tract. Survivors are often left with life-long disabilities, such as blindness, deafness or brain damage. Don\u2019t let your children be victims. Get them immunised. \n \nThe post appeared first on Vanguard News . \n \nOriginal Article \n \nMEASLES: It Is Not Just A Little Rash \nMEASLES: It Is Not Just A Little Rash \nMEASLES: It Is Not Just A Little Rash \nMEASLES: It Is Not Just A Little Rash \nMEASLES: It Is Not Just A Little Rash \n MEASLES: It Is Not Just A Little Rash  MEASLES: It Is Not Just A Little Rash","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Public health news","group":"Science"}],"title":"MEASLES: It is not just a little rash","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Ondo State News Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608959245","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Ondo State News Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://ondostatenews.online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/01/measles-not-just-little-rash/","http://www.vanguardngr.com/"],"sequenceId":"695197109142","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

However, much of that development hasn\u2019t happened so the NTA hasn\u2019t deemed the project worth opening.\n\nThat means that it has remained unopened, but locals are keen to see it utilised. While 2,000 homes are planned for the area in the medium-term, the station is mentioned in the NTA\u2019s Greater Dublin Area Plan for 2016-2035 as part of the service for south-west Dublin. It does not, however, mention when the station would be opened.\n\nThe gate to the access road. \n\nLocal councillor William Lavelle says that Transport Minister Shane Ross needs to step in.\n\n\u201cLucan is crippled by traffic congestion. It is therefore incredible, indeed scandalous, to think that this station, which is widely reported to have cost \u20ac6.35 million to build, continues to lie idle for nearly seven years, despite being located within a short walking distance of multiple Lucan housing estates.\n\n\u201cKishogue is the last \u2018ghost station\u2019 left unopened in Dublin.\u201d\n\nLavelle was angered that the station wasn\u2019t opened at the same time as the Phoenix Park tunnel, which would have given locals access to both sides of Dublin city by rail.\n\nBoth Irish Rail and the National Transport Authority have claimed that funding is necessary for works to complete an access road and car-park, which Lavelle says would be the \u201cmost expensive tarmac job in history\u201d.\n\nIrish Rail says that the station will remain closed unless it gets \u20ac2 million from the NTA.\n\n\u201cThe station was not opened at the time of construction, as expected development adjacent to the station \u2013 including the access road \u2013 had not materialised, and this situation remains unchanged.\n\n\u201cThe station requires in the region of \u20ac2 million of capital expenditure to complete a car park, access road and other works to allow the station to open. Decisions on future capital programme will be made by the National Transport Authority, in the context of the Greater Dublin Area Transport Strategy.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson added that there are no specific monthly costs for maintaining the site, but that it is checked every quarter to ensure lifts and fire detection systems are operational.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Paul Hosford"},"topics":[{"name":"Ireland news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Dublin's last 'ghost station' will cost \u20ac2 million to open","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"IE","country":"Ireland"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"TheJournal.ie","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"175383370","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"286"},"name":"TheJournal.ie","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thejournal.ie"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197117365","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:34:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://img2.thejournal.ie/article/3202996/river/?height=400&version=3208932"}],"video":[]}}

Arrogate blew open the $12 million race going to the far turn, leaving California Chrome in his wake to struggle home a distant ninth, 29 1/2 lengths behind. \n \nIt was the poorest performance of Chrome's 27-race career, which ended in the Pegasus. There was a report x-rays were going to be taken of his right knee. \n \nIn their previous meeting in the Breeders' Cup Classic , Arrogate had to rally to finish a half-length ahead. Saturday he was almost half the stretch the best. In his past three races, Arrogate has run the fastest Travers in history at Saratoga, followed that with the Breeders Cup Classic and topped it by capturing the world's richest race. The $7 million he earned for running a mile and an eighth in 1:47.61 pushed his three-race earnings beyond $11 million. \n \nTrainer Bob Baffert said he has no immediate plans for Arrogate. The ultimate goal is another trip to the Breeders' Cup in November and perhaps an encore in the 2018 Pegasus, which Belinda Stronach of The Stronach Group said likely be back at Gulfstream. \n \nShaman Ghost, owned by Frank Stronach, who created the Pegasus, was second, 4 3/4 lengths behind the winner, who crossed the finish line under Mike Smith in cruise control. Neolithic, who was on the early pace, held on for third, another 3 1/2 lengths back. \n  \nThe first half of the race played out as expected. Both favorites broke well enough. But Arrogate coming out of the ground-saving No. 1 was able to hold his position on the rail while California Chrome, saddled with the outside No. 12, had to expend energy and still was pushed three and four wide. \n \n\"I used the first turn to our advantage,\" winning jockey Mike Smith said. \"I was able to get him out and let him stretch his legs. If I could have had the lead I would have taken it.\" However, 30-1 longshot Noble Bird was intent on setting the pace, so Smith let him go, with Neolithic to his outside. \n  \nCalifornia Chrome and his rider Victor Espinoza seemed to settle comfortably into fourth, outside Arrogate. \"At the first turn I thought I was good,\" Espinoza said. \n \nThis feeling subsided as they raced down the backstretch. \"I could see Victor was nuzzling his horse and he wasn't responding,\" Smith said. \"He wasn't the California Chrome that I know.\" Espinoza ratified that thought. \"When we hit the five-eighths pole, he just completely shut down.

Eduardo Ano said the body of the suspected Indonesian, known by his nom de guerre Mohisen, was recovered by troops along with three slain Filipino followers of militant leader Isnilon Hapilon, who was seriously wounded in the hilly outskirts of Butig town in Lanao del Sur province. \n \n\r\n\tHapilon was wounded in the arm and was losing blood after air force warplanes, including South Korean-made FA50 fighter jets, unleashed 500-pound bombs Wednesday night and Thursday on a militant encampment in an ongoing offensive, Ano said. It was the first time that the FA50s, which were acquired in late 2015 as the military's only fighter jets, were deployed in a combat mission. \n \n\r\n\tHapilon, who has reportedly been designated to lead an Islamic State group branch in Southeast Asia, was being moved around by his men in a makeshift stretcher but could not escape from Lanao, about 520 miles south of Manila, because artillery-backed troops have blocked possible exit points, Ano said. \n \n\r\n\t\"We're making it very difficult for them to move around and survive,\" Ano told The Associated Press by telephone. \n \n\r\n\tThe military will ask Indonesian authorities for help in confirming the identity and background of Mohisen, who was not in the list of foreign militants previously monitored as having joined Filipino militant groups in the south. \n \n\r\n\tHapilon, who is on the U.S. Department of Justice list of most-wanted terrorists worldwide with a reward of up to $5 million for his capture, moved to Butig from his stronghold on southern Basilan island a month ago with about 30 fighters to look for a base for his new militant alliance, Ano said. \n \n\r\n\tIS group commanders apparently wanted Hapilon to set up a base in Lanao, a vast region that offers more security including the presence of other Muslim insurgent groups than his mountain base on Basilan island, so foreign militants can have a springboard to expand their influence in the region, he said. \n \n\r\n\tThe ongoing offensive \"is significant because it will derail their plan to expand the IS presence to mainland Mindanao,\" said Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, referring to the southern Philippine region, the scene of decadeslong uprisings by minority Muslims. \n \n\r\n\tPresident Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly warned that the emergence of Islamic State-influenced militant groups is fast looming as a major national security threat. While pursuing peace talks with two large Muslim rebel groups in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation, he has ordered the military to destroy smaller but brutal extremist groups like the Abu Sayyaf, which is dreaded for cross-border kidnappings, beheadings and bombings. \n \n\r\n\tDuterte has asked the two Muslim rebel groups in talks with the government not to help extremists under attack by troops, warning that may bring them in a new conflict with Manila. \n \n\r\n\tThe elusive Hapilon, an Arabic-speaking Islamic preacher known for his expertise on commando assaults, pledged allegiance to the IS group in 2014. \n \n\r\n\tHe then organized an alliance called Dawlatul Islam Wilayatul Mashriq, which is now believed to include at least 10 small militant groups including some Abu Sayyaf factions and the Maute armed group, which he was meeting in Lanao when the military launched the airstrikes using the FA50s and OV-10 bomber planes. \n \n\r\n\tThe Maute and the Ansar Al Khilafah Philippines, another group under Hapilon's nascent alliance, have been linked to a Sept. 2 bombing of a night market that killed 15 people and wounded 69 others in southern Davao city, the president's hometown, and a failed bombing at Manila's popular Rizal Park and the U.S. Embassy last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indonesia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Southeast Asia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Philippines news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Military news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Philippine airstrikes kill suspected Indonesian militant","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Stars and Stripes","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660526","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Stars and Stripes","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stripes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197127733","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2799","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Blayney","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Blayney Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"200428034","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Blayney Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.blayneychronicle.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197134831","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

In the mayhem that ensued, the alarm and panic unleashed so visibly on that dark night scarred the collective psyche of the nation since. The one lesson for India from the incident is the need to delve deep into the causes and search for the right remedies to counter the reprehensible antics of a country that harbours and nurtures in its instruments of state, such potent evil and ill will towards India. Any effort that helps contribute towards this need is to be welcomed. Mayank Singh\u2019s novel  Wolf's Lair is a very welcome thriller for this very reason. And more. \n \n\n \nIt seems almost certain Mayank Singh\u2019s instincts as a storyteller were aroused that fateful night and a budding talent was spurred into action; as witnessed in his first and much earlier book,  26/11 The Untold Story . To my mind,  Wolf\u2019s Lair  is a natural consequence to this first book and builds on a much larger canvas. The underpinnings of  Wolf\u2019s Lair  are the shenanigans of terror unleashed without respite by India\u2019s notorious neighbor; much like a nagging street dog barking at the heels of a passing elephant. What makes  Wolf\u2019s Lair  an interesting read is the attention to detail that the author uses while preventing the narrative from the pitfalls of tediousness, using it instead to his advantage. A good work of fiction must essentially leave the reader with a sense of gain. The gain could assume the form of a sense of personal fulfillment stemming from the narrative insights into aspects of human nature, or it could be an intellectual insight into an unrecognisable facet of the world we live in, or it could impart a sense of joy that lingers.  Wolf\u2019s Lair  succeeds on all three counts. However, make no mistake, it is essentially a thriller with each page bubbling with a kind of anticipation for further twists and turns. To be honest, it rarely ever disappoints. \n \nThe book provides intimate detail, partly imagined and partly based on intricate and deep research into the workings of the machinery that engenders such acts of terror. Sometimes you gain the impression that the narrator is witnessing the events first hand; such is the attention to detail. The narrative draws upon and casts light on recent history and the characters are crafted with a touch that lends them their reality. The diabolical evil that lurks in the mind of the chief antagonist, Rehan Khan is portrayed with a flair that reveals how vivid and in-control the imagination of the author is. The characters are written to portray all this with natural ease, together with all the flaws and traits that humans possess. \n \nWolf's Lair  is a vivid tale of what lurks in the cold and sinister world of regional terror and a very welcome addition to the world of thrillers that not only entertains you but also makes you think.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: book news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Mayank Singh\u2019s new novel Wolf's Lair is a very welcome thriller: Here's why","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Firstpost.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"232003819","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"97"},"name":"Firstpost.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.firstpost.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197135009","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(1:01) \n  2:28 AM ET   \nOAKLAND, Calif. -- There has been something a little off with Stephen Curry this season. \n \nHis numbers surely aren't anything to be ashamed of considering that he's playing with four All-Stars, but that electrifying zest from a year ago hasn't been present on a consistent basis. \n \nShots he usually makes and acrobatic layups he typically pulls off have repeatedly and unexpectedly come up short far too often this season. \n \nGolden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr acknowledged part of the issue was Curry trying too hard to incorporate Kevin Durant into the offensive fold. Even though this is Durant's first season with the Warriors, he also noticed Curry wasn't himself in the first 30 or so games. \n \nIt prompted Durant to engage in a series of routine chats with Curry over the next few weeks. These conversations took place at practices, games and while away from the game. Durant's message was direct and simple: Get back to being yourself, and I'll adapt. \n Stephen Curry had that old swagger back on Saturday, torching the Clippers for 43 points.  Ben Margot/AP Photo \n\"I just said to him, 'Don't worry about me,'\" Durant told ESPN of his ongoing dialogue with Curry. \"I said, 'Just play your game. I'll figure it out. I'll figure it out around you. You're the engine of this team, and I know that. I'm not trying to come over and feel like everything just revolves around me. Just do you, man. I'm going to play around you. I've played this game long enough. I know how to score. I know how to find the ball. Just go out there and play your game,' and that's what he's been doing.\" \n \nOn Saturday, Kerr said he read something online recently in which the writer asked, \"Is Steph gonna Steph?\" Curry torched the Los Angeles Clippers for 43 points on 15-of-23 shooting, 9-of-15 from long distance and added nine rebounds and six assists in 29 minutes. \n \nGolden State won handily, 144-98 at Oracle Arena. Curry did not play in the fourth quarter. \n \n\"Whatever [Steph gonna Steph] means, I think that's what happened,\" Kerr said. \n \nThe back-to-back MVP was back at his cheat-code, video-game-playing self that was reminiscent of his 2015-16 campaign. When he let it fly Saturday, it found the bottom of the net. It got to the point where you knew that once the ball left his hands, three more points would automatically be added. \n \nHe even launched a 51-foot half-court shot that beat the buzzer to end the first half. It was his first 40-plus-foot jumper of the season. He made four of them last season. \n \nCurry wasn't overthinking the game. That zestfulness was back. He danced all evening following the swishing of his treys. He was just being himself, doing exactly what Durant has been asking of him. \n  \nCheck out the team site for more game coverage \n  \nCheck out the team site for more game coverage \n \n\"For lack of a better term, he said I need to get in my bag and be aggressive,\" Curry told ESPN of Durant's message. \"That back-and-forth dialogue is where you build chemistry and camaraderie to get through the season. You understand what each other needs to hear. It was not a come-to-Jesus meeting; it's just being locked in, observing what's going on and having each other's back. You need that encouragement along the way.\" \n \nCurry said Durant didn't have to reach out and encourage him, but he's glad he did. \n  \n\"It didn't hurt,\" he said to ESPN. \"I feel like I'm self-motivated enough to figure it out, but along the way if you get in your own head, you need an outside perspective of what other people see, especially a guy that invests a lot in the game just like I do. It didn't hurt, for sure. That's what we're going to need going forward as well.\" \n \nDurant has been careful about not stepping on toes. He said adaptability is one of his greatest traits. He wants his teammates to play to their strengths, and if anyone must sacrifice, he's willing to do so. \n \nHe's seen enough sacrificing from Curry, and he's going to continuously urge his point guard to just be \"Steph.\" \n \n\"I think the whole season he's been having an impact on the game that is kind of different from last year where he maybe made 10 or 11 3s in the game. But this year he's still making the right plays in pick-and-roll, drawing three or four guys and kicking out,\" Durant said to ESPN. \"But then tonight, you see he gets hot so quick, and that's not a coincidence. That's just from him playing the right way. I want him to be himself.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NBA news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"With Kevin Durant's encouragement, Stephen Curry back to starry form","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"ESPN.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587667","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"ESPN.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","Basketball"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.espn.go.com","publisher":"ESPN, Inc"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry","http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors","http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant","http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers","http://www.espn.com/nba/game?gameId=400900128","http://www.nba.com/warriors","http://www.nba.com/clippers"],"sequenceId":"695197135194","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Sushi? No doubt it's one of the most famous dishes of the cuisine but there's more to Japanese food than just that. Simple, minimal, refined and vibrant \u2014these are some adjectives we associate with this cuisine. The emphasis is on fresh ingredients, of which the chefs and cooks retain as much of the original flavours and textures. \n \nSushi  ( Soo-shee ) \n \nYou can\u2019t talk about Japanese food and not mention sushi. It\u2019s amazing how this humble dish evolved from a mere method of preserving fish to being a symbol of Japanese cuisine, all across the planet. \n  \nSushi boat with norimaki and nigirizushi at Umame, Mumbai \n  \nAromatic balls of sticky rice adorned with seaweed and sliced fish, this healthy dish is more diverse than what one can think. Traditionally, there are four types of sushi: nigiri which is small balls of rice shrouded with fish;  gunkar, a cup-like sushi made of dried seaweed and rice; norimaki is sticky rice and fish or vegetable roll; and temaki , a hand-rolled sushi in a conical shape. \n \nTry the sushi at at  Sushi Koi ,  Umame  and  San Qui  in Mumbai; at  Shizusan  and  Koji  in Pune;  Mekong ,  Collage  and  Jonathan's Kitchen  in Hyderabad;  Benihana ,  Kyoto ,  Ichiban  and  Wasabi by Morimoto - Taj Mahal Hotel  in Delhi; at  Fuji and The Sushi Oke  in Kolkata; at the  Pan Asian- ITC Grand Chola  in Chennai and  Harima  in Bengaluru. \n \nOkonomiyaki  ( O-ko-nomi-yaa-ki ) \n \nEver heard of Japanese pancakes? Yes, they\u2019re real and delicious too! Okonomiyaki literally translates to \u2018what you liked grilled\u2019 and it can safely be called the Japanese equivalent of a pancake. \n  \nA delectable mini meal: Okonomiyaki \n  \nA dish that originally started as a dessert made for Buddhist ceremonies , Funoyaki in the 1600s has come a long way to being a savoury pancake. Loaded with meat, veggies and seafood, with a liberal use of sauces, it makes for a flavourful and filling mini-meal. \n \nSample Okonomiyaki at  Kofuku ,  Ruka  and  Japani  in Mumbai;  Shizusan  in Pune;  Benihana and  Kyoto  in Delhi;  The Wall  in Kolkata;  Harima  in Bengaluru. \n \nTempura  ( Tem-poo-ra ) \n \nIf you think fried food is greasy, you should get your hands on a plate of tempura \u2014 fritters of meat or vegetables made in a light batter. \n  \nPrawns tempura \n  \nThe finesse in making a plateful involves ensuring the oil is at the correct temperature, so the inside is cooked well whilst the batter outside stays crispy. Light on the palate, a well-made tempura is nothing like the greasy fried chicken you get at fast food joints. And it is delicious! \n \nBite into crispy tempura at  Kofuku ,  Shiro  and  Sushi Koi  in Mumbai;  Shizusan  in Pune;  Benihana  and  Ichiban  in Delhi; The Co. by Wok Anthems \u2014 Dee Empresa Hotel and Fuji  at Kolkata; Sushi In A Box at Chennai;  Harima  in Bengaluru. \n \nUdon  ( Oo-donne ) \n \nWhat do you crave when it is cold and dark outside? A comforting bowl of broth with noodles. Udon is a thick wheat noodle usually served in a broth with tempura. It is a Japanese favourite and it\u2019s just as comforting in India too! \n  \nUdon. Representational image \n  \nSavour a bowl at  Kofuku ,  Wasabi by Morimoto  \u2014 Taj Mahal Palace and  Shiro  in Mumbai; at  Ichiban  in Delhi; at  Fung Shway  in Kolkata; Sushi in a Box in Chennai;  Harima  in Bengaluru. \n \nSashimi  ( Sa-see-me ) \n \nDoes the thought of eating raw seafood make you cringe? Have a look at a well-made Sashimi plate and you\u2019ll fall in love with it. Sashimi is raw or blanched seafood thinly sliced and served with dipping sauces. The chefs who make sashimi do so with great care to ensure no bones remain as the dish and there's nothing fishy about it! \n  \nSashimi platter \n  \nTry this at  Kofuku ,  Ruka  and  Yuuka, St. Regis  in Mumbai;  Shizusan  and  Koji  in Pune;  Benihana ,  Ichiban  and Kyoto in Delhi; Fung Shway in Kolkata; Sushi in a Box at Chennai. \n \nGyoza  ( Guh-yo-ja ) \n \nWho says war only makes history? Sometimes, it also gives rise to good food. At the time of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese soldiers during their occupation of Manchuria, adopted the Chinese Jioazi dumpling and brought it back home. That\u2019s where the classic Japanese gyoza hail from. Usually filled with seasoned minced meat, this bundle of goodness can be made three ways: Yaki Gyoza (pan-fried), Sui Gyoza (boiled/steamed) and Age Gyoza (deep fried). \n  \nGyoza \n  \nTuck into gyoza at  Kofuku ,  Shiro  and  Tokyo Treat  in Mumbai; at  Kyoto  in Delhi; at Spice Kraft in Kolkata; Aki Bay and PAN Asian \u2014 ITC Grand Chola in Chennai;  Harima  in Bengaluru. \n \nYakitori  ( Yak-ee-to-ree ) \n \nTranslated as grilled chicken on a stick, yakitori is a bar favourite. Juicy succulent pieces of chicken are seasoned with salt, skewered and grilled. It isn\u2019t only a delicious bar nibble, it doubles up as a snack on-the-go too! \n  \nYakitori skewers \n  \nSnack on some yakitori along with a glass of beer or sake at  Ruka ,  Shiro  and  Kofuku  in Mumbai. Also at  Benihana  and  Ichiban  in Delhi; Zen \u2014 The Park in Kolkata; Teppan in Chennai. \n \nBento  ( Ben-toe ) \n \nWith the passage of time, Japanese food has evolved and for everybody who thinks lunch boxes are boring, you\u2019ve probably never heard of a Bento Box. Healthy and delicious, it is a flavourful ensemble of meat, seafood, vegetables, rice and pickles. Covering almost all the food groups, this isn\u2019t only a nutritious meal \u2014 it is a visual treat too! \n  \nBento Box \n  \nEnjoy a nutritious Bento Box at  Tokyo Treat  and  Shiro  in Mumbai; at  Kyoto  in Delhi; The Wall (named Steamboat) in Kolkata; Sushi in a Box at Chennai;  Edo \u2013 ITC Gardenia  in Bengaluru. \n \nTeppanyaki  ( Te-panya-ki ) \n \n\n \nThe word teppanyaki means 'grilling on an iron plate'; it may seem simple, but don't be misled! Chefs exhibit their art in a live kitchen with a culinary-theatrical performance with staples such as soba or udon and meat. Just like gyoza, teppanyaki is a recent addition to the cuisine \u2014 just after World War II with the advent of the Japanese steakhouse. \n \nSavour this performance in Mumbai at San Qui ,  Kofuku  and  Wasabi by Morimoto ; in Delhi at I chiban ; in Kolkata at Pan Asian \u2014 ITC Sonar and Zen \u2014 The Park; Sushi Box at Chennai; in Bengaluru at  Edo \u2013 ITC Gardenia . \n \nTonkatsu  (Ton-ka-tsu) \n  \nAn anytime snack: Tonkatsu \n  \nJust when you thought that you knew Japanese cuisine, you have another chapter to learn. Katsu is similar to a cutlet or a schnitzel. Thick cuts of meat, usually pork, are breaded and deep fried. Served in a rice bowl ( katsudon ), as a sandwich ( katsu sudon ) or with curry ( kare katsu ), but it can be savoured just as it is with coleslaw too! \n \nDig into tonkatsu in Mumbai at  Fat kid Deli ,  Kofuku  and  Japani ; and in Chennai at Fuji. \n \nWith inputs from Husein Upletawala. Images for representational purposes only. Photo credits: Cryselle D'souza \n \nThis article originally

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2799","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Blayney","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Blayney Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"200428034","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Blayney Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.blayneychronicle.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197139638","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

For 20 years, MOMIX has been celebrated for its ability to conjure up a world of surrealistic images using props, light, shadow, humor and the human body. \n   \nIn addition to stage performances world-wide, the company has frequently worked on special projects and in film and television. MOMIX has made five Italian RAI television features broadcast to 55 countries, including the USSR and China, and has performed on Antenne II in France.

This work was the forerunner of \"Baseball\" which was created by Pendleton in 1994. \n   \nMOMIX is featured in one of the first IMAX films in 3-D, \"IMAGINE\", premiered at the Taejon Expo 93 and subsequently released at IMAX theaters world-wide.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 10 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lancaster","zipCode":"17603","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169674001","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"WGAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197144361","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Tourists prepare cash to spend while lai see money also contributes to the biggest demand for banknotes every year,\u201d she said. \n \nIt is a Chinese tradition that married people need to give lai see packets with new banknotes, usually HK$20, to children or unmarried young people, as \u201clucky money\u201d. \n \nMost Chinese companies will also give their employees a HK$100 lai see packet on the first day back at work after the Lunar New Year. \n \nTraditionally, bank customers ask for newly printed banknotes for their lai see packets. Banks usually let customers exchange old notes for new banknotes about two weeks ahead of the Lunar New Year. \n \nMany banks open earlier and close later to allow customers to exchange banknotes. \n \nThe HKMA also dispatches its own staff to monitor bank branches to make sure the exchange is as smooth as possible, Yip said \n \nShe said many customers, especially the elderly, insist on newly printed banknotes for their lai see packets as they follow the tradition that everything has to be brand new. \n \n\u201cHowever, this is not very environmentally friendly as it takes a lot of cotton and energy to make new banknotes,\u201d she said. \n \nThat\u2019s why the HKMA in 2006 launched \u201cying-san notes\u201d, or \u201cgood as new notes\u201d, which are used notes but still in a good enough condition for lai see. Banks in Hong Kong use machines to determine if banknotes are clean and good enough to use as lucky money. \n \nThis year, among all banknotes available for lai see, there are about 50 per cent that are ying-san notes while the rest are newly printed. This compares with only 20 per cent of ying-san notes when the scheme first launched in 2006. \n \n\u201cOn average, it takes about one tonne of cotton for every 1 million banknotes. With about 50 per cent of lai see banknotes as ying-san notes, we print 175 million fewer new notes, so this saves about 175 million tonnes of cotton, as well as ink and energy used for the printing, plus transportation costs,\u201d Yip said. \n \nShe said the number of banknotes in circulation are affected by the distribution of lai see money. Last year, banknotes in circulation peaked at almost HK$400 billion in February during the Lunar New Year, up from about HK$360 billion in January. However, the number went down to about HK$370 billion in March. \n \n\u201cEvery year it repeats the same cycle \u2013 parents or grandparents exchange banknotes at the banks to prepare lai see for the children. When the children use the lai see to buy toys, the shops deposit the banknotes in the bank and the money circulates back into the banking system,\u201d she said. \n \nOn average, the larger the denomination of the lai see, such as HK$1,000 or HK$500 banknotes, the faster it returns to the banking system, meaning they remain in good condition longer and can be used for two to three years before needing to be destroyed and replaced by new notes. \n \nThe HK$100 and HK$20 banknotes, the most commonly seen denominations used for lai see, are usually circulated more frequently in retail transactions before being deposited in banks, so they usually only last 18 months on average before needing replacement. \n \nBoth the Bank of East Asia and Hang Seng Bank said customers prefer newly printed banknotes for lai see money, but would accept ying-san notes if they cannot get newly printed ones. A Hang Seng Bank spokesman said the HK$20 and HK$100 banknotes were the most popular while a Bank of East Asia spokesman said HK$50 banknotes were the most popular among its customers.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Enoch Yiu"},"topics":[{"name":"Retail banking news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"China news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Hong Kong\u2019s Lunar New Year lai see tradition is big business with 400 million more banknotes in circulation","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Eastern Asia","countryCode":"HK","country":"Hong Kong"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"South China Morning Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169685908","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"216"},"name":"South China Morning Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.scmp.com","publisher":"South China Morning Post Publishers"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197145181","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:25Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/140x87/public/images/methode/2017/01/29/40803074-e464-11e6-8801-9f557f980a64_image_hires.JPG?itok=DXFrOeup"}],"video":[]}}

The audience, waiting silently for the performance to begin, was veiled in a dim light. Soft music played on. The music got stronger as the Rakugo master Katsura Sunshine entered the hall, and the light got brighter. Sunshine gently shone on the stage. He squatted gently but geared up the show abruptly with power monologue pushing his audience into amusement. \n \nRakugo, organised by the Japanese Embassy, warmed the audience with comic blows on a damp and cold day of January 27. \n \nSunshine made a quick survey of audience that showed only a couple had seen a Rakugo performance before. With this fact in mind, he explained the rituals of a Rakugo performance. Believed to be a tradition of over 400 years of comic story telling in Japan, Rakugo features minimalistic performance art with a lone storyteller dressed in kimono and equipped with only a hand fan and a hand towel as props. \n \nSunshine was in black kimono. The preceding monologue explained how Sunshine, a Canadian, could speak Japanese a little without learning at all. The audience burst into laughter on knowing how the prolonged pronunciation of some English words made him able to get the food he wanted. Another material he presented was about 47 different polite expressions in Japanese to express gratitude. He compared some of them and the conclusion was \u2014 the longer the phrase is, the more polite the expression would be! \n \nHe made various characters on stage but Sunshine differentiated them by moving his head from left to right or vice versa , as well as with a subtle change in tempo, intonation, posture, gesture et cetera . And while hearing him pronounce a very long name of a boy with different tempo in different situations, it sounded as if he was chanting a very long mantra. It was even funnier with punch lines like \u201cthe school time was already over before his mother could make the boy with the very long name wake up\u201d. Sunshine ended the performance with a zoo story, a relatively longer story that was full of comic plots. \n \n\u201cWhy do you tell stories?\u201d when asked, Sunshine answered with a smile, \u201cFirst, I tell stories to make people laugh and, second, to provide them a window to the Japanese tradition.\u201d \n \nThe answer provides us a window to look at some dying traditions of storytelling in Nepal: some of them like Sarangi and Hudke are on the verge of extinction, and some others like Baikan Kanegu (said to be highly ritualised storytelling form among Bajracharyas) are almost extinct. Stories make things easier to understand and easier to remember as well. Beyond amusement, stories bring the whole tradition, history and philosophy of a nation and its people alive from generation to generation. \n \n(The author is a dramaturge at Theatre Village ) \n \nA version of this article appears in print on January 29, 2017 of The Himalayan Times. \n \nFollow The Himalayan Times on Twitter and","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Understanding Japanese culture through humour","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"NP","country":"Nepal"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Himalayan Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169921358","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"88"},"name":"Himalayan Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://thehimalayantimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://1hu9t72zwflj44abyp2h0pfe.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/storytelling-Rakugo-master-Katsura-Sunshine.jpg","https://twitter.com/thehimalayan","https://www.facebook.com/TheHimalayanTimesOnline"],"sequenceId":"695197145357","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T23:24:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://thehimalayantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/storytelling-Rakugo-master-Katsura-Sunshine.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

And the sixth edition of the four-day Nepal Literature Festival began in this nature\u2019s literary creation, Pokhara, on January 27. Held in Kathmandu till its fourth edition, the festival is being held in Pokhara since last year. \n \nLitterateur Dhruba Chandra Gautam inaugurated the festival on the premises of Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) at Pokhara\u2019s Pardi. He told that such a programme would help promote Nepali literature. \n \nThe Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of NTB Dipakraj Joshi said that development of language and literature would offer quality contribution to the development of tourism. \n \nOrganiser Ajit Baral said that presence of the litterateurs had encouraged them to hold the festival in the Lake City. \n \nAround 100 speakers, writers, sociologists, politicians, critics, among others, are discussing various issues in 40 sessions. And for this many litterateurs, critics, writers and artists have already arrived in the Lake City. \n \nThe discussion on books and contemporary issues has served as a bridge to connect writers and readers in a single forum. Thus, the event participants felt that the festival has helped narrow the gap between writers and readers. \n \nLitterateur Amar Neupane said the festival had provided an opportunity for readers and writers to meet and talk face-to-face. \n \nThe discussion is not confined to literature alone. Experts on journalism, movies, dramas, sociology, and political science talked about multiple issues and contexts facing the country and world. Chief speaker, educationist Kedarbhakta Mathema said that political meddling had become a major problem in Nepal\u2019s education system. He expressed his concern over the lack of teaching pedagogy that would enable primary to university level students to be creative and to ask questions. \n \nRabindra Adhikari, President of Parliamentary Committee on Development, argued that the infrastructure development alone could not be considered the base of development. \n \nThe participation of foreign writers has, no doubt, increased the pride of the festival. \n \nA version of this article appears in print on January 29, 2017 of The Himalayan Times. \n \nFollow The Himalayan Times on Twitter and","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Literature festival begins in Pokhara","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"NP","country":"Nepal"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Himalayan Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169921358","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"88"},"name":"Himalayan Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://thehimalayantimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://1hu9t72zwflj44abyp2h0pfe.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Nepal-Literature-Festival-in-Pokhara.jpg","https://twitter.com/thehimalayan","https://www.facebook.com/TheHimalayanTimesOnline"],"sequenceId":"695197147376","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T23:15:54Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://thehimalayantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Nepal-Literature-Festival-in-Pokhara.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It should be seen as an opportunity to highlight all the hard work you have done in a year. There should be enthusiasm and zest. It is your decision to treat as a pleasure or pressure. Those who treat it as a pleasure will gain and those who treat it as pressure will repent. \n \n\u201cMy view is that examination is a celebration. Take it as if it is a festival. And when there is a festival or celebration, then the best comes out of us. We feel the society\u2019s strength during celebrations. Whatever is the best comes out\u2026 Smile more to score more,\u201d he said. \n \nHe gave the example of discipline seen among masses in \u2018kumbh\u2019 fair even though it is generally felt that there is a lot of indiscipline among people. \u201cThis is the strength of celebration.\u201d \n \nDuring examination, there should be a festive atmosphere among students, families and neighbours and it will convert this pressure into pleasure. \n \nHe also asked people to put examination in perspective and not treat it as \u201ca question of life and death or as a test of life but merely of the study students have put in during the year\u201d. \n \nHe urged students not to chase marks but gain knowledge. \n \n\u201cOnly studying for marks will lead to shortcuts and one will limit himself or herself. It is important to study for knowledge. Marks and marksheetd have a limited use. Knowledge, skill, self-confidence and commitment will be of use to you during life,\u201d Modi said. \n \nHe have the example of late President A P J Abdul Kalam\u2019s failure in an air force recruitment examination and said had he accepted it as a defeat, then India would not have got such a great scientist and President. \n \nHe also asked students to desist from resorting to shortcuts and cheating to score more. \n \n\u201cTo cheat is to be cheap. It makes you a bad person. If you form a habit of cheating, there will be no desire to learn. Trying to cheat involves one\u2019s time to find ways. Use it for better purposes. People have told you often but I am saying again \u2014 do not cheat. Even if no one catches you, you know that you have cheated in exams,\u201d he said.

Both men, who rouse nostalgia, are in a Major final. The Swiss and the Spaniard will be facing in the Australian Open men\u2019s final on Sunday . The match will begin at 2 pm Indian Standard Time (IST). ESPN Sony Six will broadcast the match live on television. Fans looking to catch the action online can watch free live streaming of Serena vs Venus Women\u2019s single final on Sony Liv.   While Nadal has been clearly the better player on clay, the grass would have favoured Federer\u2019s game. That equation of dominance does not stand with respect to hard courts. No player can claim that he will dominate his great rival and opponent on a hard court because the man at the other side of the net is equally capable on the same surface.   Nadal leads Federer 13-2 on clay. More importantly, Nadal has won the French Open nine times. Federer has won in France only once. On grass, the two have met only three times. Federer leads 2-1.

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n \n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n \n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n \nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n \n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n \n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\" \n \n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Kalamazoo","zipCode":"49006","state":"Michigan","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kalamazoo","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WKZO-AM","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"189985695","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"WKZO-AM","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://wkzo.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197162738","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I\u2019ll do anything to help the team win,\u201d said Bethea, who made 4 of 6 3-point attempts to go with five rebounds in 25 minutes. \n \nCorey Silverstrom also had 14 points for Chico State (18-3, 11-2 CCAA) while Robert Duncan had 11 points and four assists. Jalen McFerren totaled nine points, four assists, and he grabbed nine rebounds for the second straight night. Justin Briggs\u2019 10 points and nine rebounds, along with Bethea\u2019s total, helped the bench outscore UC San Diego\u2019s reserves 24-12. \n \nThe Tritons (15-5, 10-3 CCAA) were led by Adam Klie\u2019s 24 points, Christian Oshita had 16 points and seven rebounds as the two combined to go 15 of 29 from the field. The rest of UC San Diego was 8 of 27. \n \nBethea hit a 3 to get the deficit to single digits at 50-41. Soon after, an 18-4 stretch for the Wildcats that included a 9-0 run turned the game around. Another Bethea 3 had the Wildcats within 52-46. \n \nA dunk by Briggs tied the game at 54 with 7:18 left before another Bethea 3 gave Chico State a 57-56 lead and had the Acker faithful roaring with 6:46 left. \n \nIsaiah Ellis then somehow grabbed an offensive rebound and got the layup to go down as he did, too, for a 61-60 Chico State advantage with 2:26 left. \n \n \n\u201cHonestly, Isaiah Ellis is a huge key to us winning this game,\u201d Bethea said. \u201cI love that dude.\u201d \n \nDuncan found Ellis as he hit a jumper in the paint as part of his nine points and a 65-62 lead with 34 seconds in the game. \n \nKlie answered with a jumper to get UC San Diego within 65-64, but with 26 seconds left the Tritons had to foul. McFerren made both free throws. \n \nA tying 3 from Klie was off the mark with 4 seconds left, and McFerren got the rebound and made two more free throws to end it. \n \nThe Tritons made their first four 3-point attempts but ended up 5 of 16 from outside on the night including missing all eight in the second half, a stunning turnaround after leading the hosts 42-29 at the break. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t have to say much at halftime,\u201d Chico State head coach Greg Clink said. \u201cThey knew.\u201d \n \nUC San Diego led 22-9 after its fourth 3 with 10:49 in the first half. \n \nA 9-0 Chico State run cut the San Diego lead to 28-22 with Duncan providing six of the points and Bethea providing plays. His steal and assist to Duncan for a layup capped the spurt after he scored with an offensive rebound and layup. \n \nMichel Shoemaker, a Corning High graduate and former Butte College standout, played 11 minutes and scored four points for the Tritons as a large contingent of Corning fans cheered him on. \n Women  \nUC San Diego 68, Chico State 48 >> The Wildcats took a 40-39 lead in the third quarter, but the first-place Tritons responded with a 9-0 run to end the period and kept going in the fourth quarter on Marcella Hughes\u2019 3-pointer as the first of two 12-0 runs that paved the way to their 12th straight victory. \n \nExcept for Whitney Branham\u2019s third 3 of the night that had Chico State within 51-43, the Tritons led by double digits the rest of the way. \n \nThe Wildcats missed 11 of 12 shots at one point in the quarter as UC San Diego (16-3, 12-1 CCAA) pulled ahead by as much as 20 multiple times. \n \nBranham led Chico State (12-7, 7-6 CCAA) with 13 points. McKena Barker and Sammy DeHart added eight points apiece while Madison Wong tallied five assists and three steals. Tyler Prange had four assists. \n \nUC San Diego outrebounded Chico State 42-29. The Tritons also made 11 of 26 3-pointers with Beth Mounier finishing 6 of 10 as part of her game-high 24 points. Cassie MacLeod had 13 points and nine rebounds. \n \nThe game was close early on as teams exchanged baskets, featuring multiple ties before a Wildcats dry spell in the second quarter led to a UC San Diego 29-22 advantage at halftime.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Joseph Shufelberger"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Wildcats claim sole possession of first place with second-half comeback vs. UC San Diego","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Butte","zipCode":"95966","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Oroville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Oroville Mercury-Register","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660723","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Oroville Mercury-Register","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.orovillemr.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197166637","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.orovillemr.com/storyimage/NB/20170128/SPORTS/170129685/AR/0/AR-170129685.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It will have facilities such as berthing space for two vessels simultaneously, storage area, transit shed, parking areas, among others. \n \nThe Varanasi terminal with 0.54 million tons per annum of cargo handling capacity in Phase 1, will complement the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC) project, enabling movement of cargo from Ludhiana in Punjab to Haldia in West Bengal and further east, said an official at the Ministry. \n \n\u201cWith the cost of transportation by waterways being 30-50 paisa per tonne per km (PTPK) only, compared to Rs 1 PTPK for rail, and Rs 1.5 PTPK for road, various government and private entities have already shown interest in transporting their cargo using the facility,\u201d the official added. \n \nNW-1, along with proposed EDFC and NH-2, constitutes the Eastern Transport Corridor of India connecting the National Capital Region (NCR) with the eastern and north-eastern states and will function as a link to Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Nepal and other east and south-east Asian countries through the Kolkata Port and Indo- Bangladesh Protocol Route. \n \nCurrently, a large portion of cargo from north India is transported to the ports of Kandla and Mumbai through land routes at high cost, and there is much reluctance of the shippers to transport the cargo to the eastern ports of Kolkata, Dhamra, and Paradip.

It is also attempting to create its own state, which ISIS claims as a \u2018caliphate\u2019. But there can be no accommodation or negotiation with it,\u201d Trump said in his executive order. \n \n\u201cFor those reasons I am directing my administration to develop a comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS,\u201d he said. \n \nThe plan to be submitted to the President within 30 days calls for a comprehensive strategy to defeat the ISIS and recommend changes to any US rules of engagement and other American policy restrictions that exceed the requirements of international law regarding the use of force against the terror group. \n \nTrump said the ISIS has engaged in a systematic campaign of persecution and extermination in those territories it enters or controls. \n \n\u201cIf ISIS is left in power, the threat that it poses will only grow,\u201d he warned. \n \n\u201cWe know it has attempted to develop chemical weapons capability. It continues to radicalise our own citizens, and its attacks against our allies and partners continue to mount. \n \nThe US must take decisive action to defeat ISIS,\u201d Trump said. \n \nThe terror group is responsible for the violent murder of American citizens in the Middle East, including the beheading of James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and Peter Abdul-Rahman Kassig, as well as the death of Kayla Mueller, the executive order notes, the executive order said. \n \nIn addition, ISIS has inspired attacks in the United States, including the December 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, and the June 2016 attack in Orlando, Florida, it said. \n \n\u201cISIS is complicit in a number of terrorist attacks on our allies in which Americans have been wounded or killed, such as the November 2015 attack in Paris, France, the March 2016 attack in Brussels, Belgium, the July 2016 attack in Nice, France, and the December 2016 attack in Berlin, Germany,\u201d said the executive order. \n \nThe plan seeks public diplomacy, information operations, and cyber strategies to isolate and delegitimise ISIS and its radical Islamist ideology; identification of new coalition partners in the fight against ISIS and policies to empower coalition partners to fight ISIS and its affiliates; and mechanisms to cut off or seize ISIS\u2019s financial support, including financial transfers, money laundering, oil revenue, human trafficking, sales of looted art and historical artifacts, and other revenue sources. \n \nThis is published unedited from the PTI feed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"Military news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Trump gives US military 30 days to prepare anti-ISIS strategy","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"India.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597540856","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"India.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.india.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197169752","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:16Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://s3.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/indiacom-image-banner_05.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2567","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Narellan","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wollondilly Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"346769048","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Wollondilly Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wollondillyadvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197177415","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

They\u2019re co-ordinating with private attorneys and firms that have volunteered to help. They\u2019re reviewing statutes, setting priorities and seeking donations. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all-out war,\u201d said Vermont Law School Professor Patrick Parenteau. \u201cIf you\u2019re an environmentalist or conservationist, this is indeed a scary time.\u201d \n \nTrump\u2019s first week in office only heightened their anxieties. He moved to resume construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines that the Obama administration had halted, while signalling intentions to abandon his predecessor\u2019s fight against global warming, vastly expand oil and gas drilling on public lands and slash the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s budget. \n \nGOP lawmakers, meanwhile, introduced measures to overturn a new Interior Department rule barring coal mining companies from damaging streams and to remove some wolves from the endangered species list. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019ve wasted no time in doing bad things,\u201d said Pat Gallagher, director of the Sierra Club\u2019s 50-member legal team, which he said is likely to grow as environmentalists increasingly regard the courts as their best option, even though success there is far from certain. \n \nThe Department of Justice, which represents the federal government in environmental lawsuits, declined to comment, while the White House did not respond to emails seeking comment. Doug Ericksen, communications director for Trump\u2019s transition team at EPA, said of the environmentalists that he\u2019s \u201cnot sure what they think they\u2019re preparing for\u201d but suspects they are stoking fear of Trump as a fundraising tool. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019re more concerned about raising money than protecting the environment,\u201d Ericksen said. \n \nJim Burling, litigation director for the Pacific Legal Foundation, a non-profit property rights group that sues regulators on behalf of businesses and landowners, also contended environmental groups were exaggerating the Trump administration\u2019s threat for political and financial gain. \n \nThe government bureaucracy is entrenched, Burling said, and, \u201cwho happens to occupy the White House hasn\u2019t made that much difference.\u201d \n \nEnvironmentalists say their fears are justified by the new administration\u2019s antagonism toward government\u2019s role in keeping air and water clean and the planet from overheating. \n \nDonations began increasing after Trump\u2019s election, \u201ceven before the fundraising letters were sent\u201d asking for support to fight the administration\u2019s actions, said David Goldston, government affairs director at the Natural Resources Defence Council. \n \nEarthjustice, which has represented the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in its fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline, has about 100 staff attorneys and plans to bring more aboard, said Tim Preso, who manages the group\u2019s Northern Rockies office. \n \nThe Chicago-based Environmental Law & Policy Center is adding four attorneys to its pre-election staff of 18 and is co-ordinating with more than a dozen outside attorneys who would file citizen suits against polluters for free if agencies fail to enforce existing rules, said Executive Director Howard Learner. \n \n\u201cWe cannot fully substitute and replace the EPA doing its job,\u201d Learner said. \u201cBut on the other hand, we\u2019re not going to default to zero if the EPA steps backward when it comes to clean air and clean water enforcement.\u201d \n \nOn inauguration eve, five law professors filed a brief in support of a 2015 regulation giving EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers discretion to regulate tributaries and wetlands far upstream from navigable lakes and rivers to protect water quality. \n \nDozens of states have sued to block the rule \u2014 including Oklahoma, led by state Attorney General Scott Pruitt, now Trump\u2019s choice for EPA administrator \u2014 saying it gives government too much power over private property. \n \nShortly after Trump took office, his White House webpage listed the rule among \u201charmful and unnecessary policies\u201d he would target. \n \n\u201cIf the Trump administration won\u2019t defend the rule, I want to stand alongside environmental groups and do what I can to defend (it),\u201d said David Uhlmann, a University of Michigan law professor and former Justice Department prosecutor, who helped file the brief. \n \nGoing to court is just one tactic environmental lawyers will use, said Erik Schlenker-Goodrich of the Oregon-based Western Environmental Law Center, which also plans new hires. They will monitor agencies for failure to enforce pollution law or cutting corners when writing permits for activities such as oil and gas drilling, he said. \n \nThe Sierra Club\u2019s Gallagher, who sued over oil drilling beneath national parks during the George W. Bush administration, said another tactic would be making liberal use of open-records laws to obtain scientific data and other materials that might otherwise be purged. The group already has requested records on climate change from the EPA. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised at what they\u2019re doing, but maybe a little surprised at how fast and furious it\u2019s all happening,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cBut we were bracing for it and we\u2019re ready.\u201d \n \n___ \n \nFlesher reported from Traverse City, Michigan. \n \n___ \n \nFollow Webber and Flesher on Twitter: https://twitter.com/twebber02, https://twitter.com/JohnFlesher","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Environment news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Environmentalists preparing to battle Trump, GOP in court","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"T1Y","state":"Alberta","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Calgary","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"660 News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661364","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"660 News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.660news.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/twebber02","https://twitter.com/JohnFlesher"],"sequenceId":"695197178216","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:49:16Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Are they still planning to kill Dhlakama?\u201d asked the 64-year-old rebel, who often speaks about himself in the third person. \n\n\u201cAre they trying to find the river where Dhlakama is drinking from to poison it, or the roads we use to plant anti-personnel landmines?\u201d \n\nDhlakama, whose Renamo party is the main opposition in Mozambique, retreated in October 2012 to his hideout in Gorongosa with 800 former guerrillas demanding a greater share of power. \n\nIn 2013 tensions resurfaced with Renamo fighters again taking up arms against Frelimo, accusing the ruling party of enriching itself at the expense of the southern African country. \n\nOn the eve of the October 2014 general elections Renamo and the government signed a ceasefire. \n\nBut Renamo refused to accept the results of the 2014 elections when it was beaten once more at the polls by Frelimo, which has been in power since the former Portuguese colony\u2019s independence 40 years ago \n\n\u2013 \u2018Won\u2019t give up on truce\u2019 \u2013 \n\nDhlakama has accused the army of not only targeting Renamo members but civilians too. \n\n\u201cThe armed forces go to the villages, open fire to disperse the population, and then ransack the houses making off with chickens and goats, which is typical of Frelimo,\u201d he claimed, adding that women had been beaten and houses torched. \n\n\u201cEither Frelimo does not know how to control its troops or there is a clear lack of will,\u201d he said. \n\nAbuses have also been reported to international organisations by Mozambicans who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries. \n\nAuthorities in December said more than 3,000 people fleeing the conflict now live in government camps, while the UN refugee agency says another 8,600 have been forced to cross the border to Malawi and Zimbabwe. \n\nIn spite of the allegations, Dhlakama has no intention of calling off the ceasefire, which he admits he unilaterally proclaimed in a bid to reopen peace negotiations. \n\nThe peace talks with international mediators resumed in May last year but failed to prevent the escalation of tensions and by mid-December the mediators quit the country. \n\n\u201cI must speak to President Nyusi in the coming days because we are still waiting for him to give the signal for the return of mediators,\u201d said Dhlakama. \n\nThe rebel leader said he will leave his mountain base only to sign a peace agreement. \n\n\u201cWe are not going to give up on the truce. But every day someone calls me up to ask me to extend it beyond March 4. And I always tell them that it will depend on the progress of the negotiations.\u201d \n\n© 2017 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Adrien BARBIER"},"topics":[{"name":"Mozambique news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Mozambique rebel leader accuses soldiers of violating ceasefire","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Northern KZN Courier","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"533455863","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"Northern KZN Courier","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://northernnatalcourier.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197188793","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She was my biggest ally. She gave everything, she gave a tremendous, very complex performance,\u201d Villeneuve, 49, told AFP at the Producers Guild Awards (PGAs) in Beverly Hills. \n \nTaking its cue from classics such as \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d (1977) and \u201cContact\u201d (1997), \u201cArrival\u201d was filmed in Villeneuve\u2019s native Quebec for a relatively small $50 million. \n \nAdams, 42, was universally lauded for her portrayal of Louise Banks, a linguist enlisted by the army after alien pods pop up worldwide, to help figure out what their occupants want. \n   Actress Amy Adams and director Denis Villeneuve attend Adams\u2019 star ceremony on the Hollywood Walk of Fame | © Getty/AFP/File | Alberto E. Rodriguez   \nThe picture pairs Adams with fellow \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d star Jeremy Renner, playing against type as a shy, soft-spoken mathematician. \n \nThe best actress Oscar nominations went to Emma Stone (\u201cLa La Land\u201d), Natalie Portman (\u201cJackie\u201d), Ruth Negga (\u201cLoving\u201d), Isabelle Huppert (\u201cElle\u201d) and Meryl Streep (\u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins\u201d). \n \nVilleneuve told AFP he had spoken to Adams several times since the nominations and that she had been nothing but magnanimous. \n \n\u201cAmy Adams is the incarnation of grace,\u201d said the director, who made \u201cSicario\u201d (2015) and has just finished filming the much-anticipated sequel to iconic sci-fi favorite \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d \n \n\u201cShe just said to me, \u2018Danny \u2014 it\u2019s all right. The movie is nominated, you are nominated, it\u2019s all good. Don\u2019t think about it, please just celebrate.'\u201d \n \n\u201cArrival\u201d was competing for best film at the PGAs alongside \u201cDeadpool,\u201d \u201cFences,\u201d \u201cHacksaw Ridge,\u201d \u201cHell or High Water,\u201d \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d \u201cLa La Land,\u201d \u201cLion,\u201d \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d and \u201cMoonlight.\u201d \n \n\u201cBlade Runner 2049\u2033 \u2014 which comes out in October, some 35 years after the cult neo-noir original \u2014 sees Harrison Ford reprising his role as Rick Deckard, this time opposite Ryan Gosling. \n \n\u201cIt was like the most powerful and intense cinematic experience of my life. It\u2019s tough to talk about it \u2014 I\u2019m still in it \u2014 but it was a very powerful experience,\u201d Villeneuve told AFP. \n \nDescribing his 74-year-old star as his \u201cchildhood hero,\u201d he admitted to being in awe of Ford when filming began last summer in Budapest, Hungary. \n \n\u201cA good thing is that Harrison is a very humble, very funny, generous human being.

Seven days later, norms and doctrine that have guided the United States for decades are being re-examined. \n\nTrump\u2019s down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address: a call to arms that tested old distinctions between left and right. \n\n\u201cToday, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cWe are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.\u201d \n\nThe establishment \u201celites\u201d in big cities, in politics and the media were no longer the technocrats in charge of the world\u2019s only superpower, they were the enemy. \n\nThe new president also put the rest of the world on notice. \n\nFor the last 75 years, America had been what Barack Obama described as the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d \u2014 the glue that bound the global order. \n\nThe era of Trump would be the era of \u201cAmerica first,\u201d he said, of naked self-interest and zero-sum diplomacy. Old alliances would be reassessed, new alliances would be explored. \n\nBefore his inauguration, many asked if the presidency would change Donald Trump, or whether Donald Trump would change the presidency. \n\nBarely 20 minutes into his four-year term, anyone who was listening had their answer. \n\n\u2013 Rolling thunder \u2013 \n\nBefore arriving at the Oval Office, Trump\u2019s strategists had decided to use the first few weeks to unleash a daily wave of executive orders. \n\nThe aim was to unbalance opponents, define Trump as a man of action and slake his supporters\u2019 thirst for change. \n\nFor much of middle America, globalization, automation and the Great Recession had been apocalyptic. \n\nPolitics had passed them over and worse, they felt steamrollered by \u201ccoastal elites\u201d in America\u2019s \u201cculture wars\u201d over abortion, gay rights, immigration, global warming and religion. \n\nTrump had won the election by promising to be their champion, and he was going to \u2014 as Ronald Reagan said \u2014 \u201cdance with the one that brung ya.\u201d \n\nFor the most part, the CEO-in-chief put forward actions that could have come from any Republican in the country: defunding abortion, preening the military and approving oil pipelines. \n\nBut it was coated with a thick veneer of nationalist and populist rhetoric, and accompanying policies championed by top aide Steve Bannon. \n\nTrump ripped up a trans-Pacific trade deal designed to counterbalance China\u2019s regional economic power, imposed a ban on refugees from Syria and migrants from seven other Muslim countries. \n\nHe ordered planning to begin to build a wall on Mexico\u2019s southern border and picked a very public fight with Mexico\u2019s president Enrique Pena Nieto, who cancelled a trip to Washington. \n\nThe United States, a nation founded by migrants, was now willing to shut its doors. \n\nNot since Obama\u2019s election or perhaps the Iraq War has America\u2019s image around the world changed so dramatically and so quickly. \n\nBut Trump supporters saw an outsider sticking up for them and sticking it to the elites. \n\n\u201cGet used to it,\u201d said Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, boasting that Trump had delivered a \u201cshock to the system.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s just getting started,\u201d she said. \n\n\u2013 Rocky start \u2013 \n\nBut it was not all positive for Trump. The White House is far from purring. Key positions have yet to be filled and the decision making process is haphazard. \n\nTrump aides were forced to publicly row back suggestions of a 20 percent border tax on Mexican goods and defend a chaotic rollout of the refugee and migrant ban. \n\nThroughout the week, Trump engaged in intemperate outbursts about the size of his inaugural crowd, alleged election fraud and perceived media persecution. \n\nPrivately, in call after call, he complained to top aides about press coverage. The impression was of a man focused on his image more than running the country. \n\nTrump also seemed like a a man for whom becoming US president was not adulation enough. \n\nSpokesman Sean Spicer \u2014 between tirades and missteps \u2014 offered a window onto the soul of the White House. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this constant theme to undercut the enormous support he has,\u201d Spicer said. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably frustrating when you\u2019re continually told it\u2019s not big enough; it\u2019s not good enough. You can\u2019t win.\u201d \n\nBut critics saw a more sinister motive for the outbursts, particularly Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that three million people voted illegally in the election. \n\nBrian Klaas, an expert on global democracy at the London School of Economics, sees Trump \u201ccasting aspersions (without evidence) on electoral integrity is a key way to restrict voting rights and erode confidence in elections.\u201d \n\n\u201cAttacking the media and blurring the lines of truth with state narratives not grounded in fact is important to sowing public doubt,\u201d he said. \n\nMindy Finn, who ran as a independent vice presidential candidate, summed up Trump\u2019s strategy as \u201csow chaos, deepen division and consolidate power.\u201d \n\nFor his harshest critics, the question is now whether Donald Trump breaks the presidency, or whether the presidency breaks Donald Trump. \n\n© 2017 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrew BEATTY"},"topics":[],"title":"In one week, Trump shakes up Washington and the world","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Northern KZN Courier","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"533455863","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"Northern KZN Courier","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://northernnatalcourier.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197189638","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Erovinkin\u2019s body was sent to the FSB morgue.\u201d \n  \nAccording to the Russian authorities, preliminary postmortem examination found no cause of death, but investigations were still ongoing. Unconfirmed official reports later claimed that Erovinkin died of a heart attack. \n  \nHas this been confirmed as fact?

But they admitted that they found no evidence supporting the lurid allegations against Trump. Media outlets that investigated the claims also said they found no evidence that the alleged \u201cgolden shower\u201d video exists. \n \nBuzzFeed came under heavy criticism from its peers for publishing the dossier after admitting that the claims were unsubstantiated. \n \nIn a recent blog post, Christo Grocev, a Bulgarian expert in Russians security issues, claimed it was likely that Erovinkin was the source close to Sechin that Steele referred to in his report. \n \n\u201cInsiders have described Erovinkin to me alternately as \u2018Sechin\u2019s treasurer\u2019 and \u2018the go-between between Putin and Sechin,'\u201d Grocev wrote. \u201cOne thing that everyone seems to agree \u2014 both in public and private sources \u2014 is that Erovinkin was Sechin\u2019s closest associate.\u201d \n \n\u201cI have no doubt that at the time Erovinkin died, Putin had Steele\u2019s Trump dossier on his desk,\u201d Grocev continued. \u201cHe would \u2013 arguably \u2013 have known whether the alleged\u2026 story is based on fact or fiction.\u201d \n  \n\u201c[Putin] had a motive to seek and find the mole. He would have had to conclude that Erovinkin was at least a person of interest.\u201d \n  \nBut, according to the Telegraph , some experts in Russian security issues have expressed skepticism about the theory that Erovinkin was murdered by the Russian state to cover up the truth about the Trump dossier. According to some experts, it is unlikely that Putin would have ordered the assassination of a senior official in the circumstances and manner that rumors suggested. \n \n[Featured Image by Alexander Nemenov/AP Images]","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Former KGB Chief Oleg Erovinkin Who Allegedly Helped To Compile 'Golden Shower' Dossier On Donald Trump Found Dead","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Inquisitr","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169676540","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"213"},"name":"Inquisitr","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.inquisitr.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/27/mystery-death-ex-kgb-chief-linked-mi6-spys-dossier-donald-trump/","https://t.co/MdWIow3kIB","https://twitter.com/hashtag/OlegErovinkin?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/kompromat?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/FSB?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/Russia?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/MI6?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/TBD?src=hash","https://twitter.com/Anna_ohlala/status/825555482685235200","https://t.co/IpR0jc4V55","https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheResistance?src=hash","https://twitter.com/noclosedminds/status/825428651072245760","https://twitter.com/hashtag/KGB?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/chief?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/helped?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/spy?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/compile?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/dossier?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/dead?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lexus?src=hash","https://t.co/NGsN54fBdR","https://t.co/ytJiiF4GUt","https://twitter.com/zeusFanHouse/status/825418412130201601","https://t.co/gMODfeIBcP","https://twitter.com/thus_spake/status/825565522427252737","https://cgrozev.wordpress.com/author/christogrozev/"],"sequenceId":"695197200653","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:11Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He was arraigned at the Anchorage Jail court Saturday afternoon. \n \nAn affidavit filed in court by APD detective Christina Roberts details the events leading up to the shooting. According to the document, a female driver took Birotte, Miller, Johnson and one other woman to the parking lot of a Brown Jug Liquor store on Muldoon Road. They were driving a blue Chevy sedan. Along the way, the group stopped at a gas station so Miller and Johnson could get cash to buy marijuana from Birotte. \n \nOnce they made it to the liquor store parking lot, investigators say the three men got out of the car and began smoking together. Shortly after a fight broke between them. Birotte\u2019s attorney, Rex Butler, say Johnson and Miller beat Birotte and robbed him of his backpack. \n \n\u201cThey beat him so bad that when he got home he had to literally crawl up the steps to his house, he couldn\u2019t walk and his mother had to care for him,\u201d Butler told reporters on Saturday. \u201cHe was brutally beaten and robbed of his backpack. It was a planned event. They took him to a spot where they thought nobody would see what was going on.\u201d \n \nAccording to the affidavit, security footage from a nearby business shows Miller and Johnson getting back into the vehicle with the two women, taking the backpack with them and leaving Birotte outside. As the vehicle starts to drive away, Birotte produces a gun and fires multiple rounds into the rear passenger window. \n \nThe female driver later told police that she noticed Johnson was unresponsive after the gunfire and she started heading towards the Alaska Native Medical Center. On the way, Miller demanded to be let out of the car and so she pulled over to the side of the road to let him exit. \n \nAt around 1:10 a.m. Anchorage police received a call from the female driver stating that Johnson had been shot and that she was driving him to ANMC. Officers responded to the hospital and found the Chevy unoccupied by the emergency room entrance. \n \n\u201cThere was blood and broken glass on the rear passenger seat and rear passenger door,\u201d investigators described in the affidavit. \n \nPolice made contact with the two female witnesses and brought them in for questioning. \n \nJohnson later died at the hospital. \n \nMiller meanwhile went to a residence in the Muldoon area where he contacted police to report that he\u2019d been shot. He was also transported to ANMC and has since been treated and released, according to the hospital. \n \nWhen detectives interviewed Miller while he was being treated he told them Birotte had \u201cshot at them because they stole his bag,\u201d according to the affidavit. \n \nAt the arraignment hearing on Saturday the judge set Birotte\u2019s appearance bond at $250,000 cash/corporate with a cash performance bond of $10,000. \n \nJohnson\u2019s mother, who attended the hearing telephonically, urged the judge to set his bail higher. \n \n\u201cI think it\u2019s too low in my opinion because there\u2019s no price for my child\u2019s life,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s gone.

The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that.\u201d \n \nScores of Arab travelers in the Middle East and North Africa denounced the order which they called humiliating and discriminatory. \n \nOne of the Iraqis detained at Kennedy Airport, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, had worked on behalf of the U.S. government in Iraq for 10 years. \n \nThe other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to the United States to join his wife, who had worked for a U.S. contractor, and young son, his lawyers said. \n \nThey said both men were detained at the airport Friday night after arriving on separate flights. \n \nThe attorneys said they were not allowed to meet with their clients, and there were tense moments as they tried to reach them. \n \nThey have now approached a US court to reverse the Trump executive order closing the nation\u2019s borders to refugees. \n \nTheir lawyers yesterday filed a writ of habeas corpus early yesterday in the Eastern District of New York seeking to have their clients released. \n \nAlso filed by them was a motion for class certification which seeks to represent all refugees and immigrants who,according to them, are being unlawfully detained at ports of entry. \n \nThe ban order suspends entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days and has now created a legal limbo for individuals on the way to the United States and panic for families who were awaiting their arrival. \n \nSeven countries -Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen- are specifically mentioned in the ban order. \n \nIt was unclear yesterday how many refugees and immigrants were being held nationwide in the aftermath of the executive order. \n \nThe six passengers who were barred yesterday from boarding EgyptAir Flight 985 at Cairo airport had valid immigration visas, sources said. \n \nThe five Iraqis had arrived in transit from Erbil and were being held at the airport until they could be re-boarded on flights back to Iraq, whereas the Yemeni passenger had arrived at the airport from elsewhere in Cairo, they added. \n \nA report yesterday said green card holders and US permanent resident are not exempted from the ban order. \n \nA UK resident, Hamaseh Tayari,was denied entry yesterday onto a Costa Rica-New York-Glasgow flight because of her Iranian passport. \n \nTayari, who had been holidaying in Costa Rica said: \u201cThis has really shocked me. We just discovered (what Trump did) at the airport when we went to check in. \n \n\u201cI want people to know that this is not just happening to refugees. I am a graduate and I have a PhD. It has happened to a person who is working and who pays tax.\u201d \n \nCustoms and border patrol agents at many airports were unaware of the executive order on Friday evening, said Mana Yegani, an immigration lawyer in Houston, who works with the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \n \nYegani and her fellow lawyers worked through the night fielding calls from travelers with student and worker visas being denied entry into the United States and ordered on flights back to Muslim-majority countries on the list. \n \nGreen card holders were also being stopped and questioned for several hours. Officials also denied travelers with dual Canadian and Iranian citizenship from boarding planes in Canada that were headed the United States, she said. \n \n\u201cThese are people that are coming in legally. They have jobs here and they have vehicles here,\u201d Yegani said. \n \nAt a joint news conference in Paris with his German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said many of Trump\u2019s decisions worried the two U.S. allies, including new immigration restrictions. \n \n\u201cThis can only worry us, but there are many subjects that worry us,\u201d Ayrault said, adding that he would soon invite his future American counterpart Rex Tillerson to Paris to explain Europe\u2019s interests, values and vision of the world. \n \n\u201cWelcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty,\u201d Ayrault said. \n \nGermany has taken in more than one million refugees and migrants, mainly from the Middle East, since 2015. \n \n\u201cThe United States is a country where Christian traditions have an important meaning. Loving your neighbor is a major Christian value, and that includes helping people,\u201d said Germany\u2019s Gabriel, who was on his first trip abroad since his nomination as foreign minister. \n \n\u201cI think that is what unites us in the West, and I think that is what we want to make clear to the Americans.\u201d \n \nThe United Nations refugee agency and International Organisation for Migration (IOM) asked Mr. Trump to continue offering asylum to people fleeing war and persecution, saying its resettlement program was vital. \n \n\u201cThe needs of refugees and migrants worldwide have never been greater and the U.S. resettlement program is one of the most important in the world,\u201d the two Geneva-based agencies said in a joint statement. \n \nIOM and UNHCR said that they remained committed to working with the U.S. administration towards a shared goal of ensuring \u201csafe and secure resettlement and immigration programmes,\u201d adding that refugees should \u201creceive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race.\u201d \n \nSome 25,000 refugees were resettled in the United States between October and year-end under UNHCR\u2019s program for the most vulnerable, the agency said on Friday. \n \nMark Zuckerberg, in his status update yesterday on the ban, said: \u201cWe need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. \n \n\u201cExpanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don\u2019t pose a threat will live in fear of deportation. \n \n\u201cWe should also keep our doors open to refugees and those who need help. That\u2019s who we are. Had we turned away refugees a few decades ago, Priscilla\u2019s family wouldn\u2019t be here today. \n \n\u201cThat said, I was glad to hear President Trump say he\u2019s going to \u201cwork something out\u201d for Dreamers \u2013 immigrants who were brought to this country at a young age by their parents. \n \n\u201cRight now, 750,000 Dreamers benefit from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that allows them to live and work legally in the US. \n \n\u201cI hope the President and his team keep these protections in place, and over the next few weeks I\u2019ll be working with our team at FWD to find ways we can help. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m also glad the President believes our country should continue to benefit from \u201cpeople of great talent coming into the country.\u201d \n \n\u201cThese issues are personal for me even beyond my family. A few years ago, I taught a class at a local middle school where some of my best students were undocumented. \n \n\u201cThey are our future too. We are a nation of immigrants, and we all benefit when the best and brightest from around the world can live, work and contribute here. \n \n\u201cI hope we find the courage and compassion to bring people together and make this world a better place for everyone.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Eve Gard"},"topics":[{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump fulfills campaign promise as US bars Muslims from entering the country","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"ForNaija.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"582875739","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"ForNaija.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fornaija.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197207603","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:16Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They\u2019re mentally tough as well. They always kept going.  \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s something that I learned from them a lot, is how to hopefully do the same, which hopefully I\u2019ve been able to do.\u201d \n \nWilliams had been reluctant to talk about records in Melbourne to keep the pressure off, but she is now ready to acknowledge her standing as one of the greatest women players of all time, if not the greatest. \n \n\u201cI definitely think so. I mean, between Martina, myself, Steffi Graf, hands down we are leading that conversation,\u201d she said. \n \nHer achievement took 19 long years from her Grand Slam debut as a 17-year-old in Melbourne in 1998, and she is not ready to stop just yet. \n \nBut she insists there are no new goals, despite Court\u2019s 24 titles being within reach. \n \n\u201cI never had a number. That\u2019s the beauty of it,\u201d she said.  \n \n\u201cWhen I started this journey, I just wanted to win a Grand Slam. Then I just wanted to win. Every time I step on the court, I want to win.\u201d \n \nAnd in an ominous sign that there is still more to come, she added: \u201cI don\u2019t want it to stop. I want to keep it going.\u201d \n \n\u2013 Enjoy the moment \u2013 \n \nBeing at the top for so long means Williams now carefully selects her tournaments, and she is set to take a break now until Indian Wells in early March. \n \nShe said she wanted to enjoy winning in Australia, and give it time to sink in. \n \n\u201cOne thing I learned in the past is you have to enjoy it. That\u2019s the beauty of winning Australia, you have a few months to relax,\u201d she said.  \n \n\u201cIf you win the French, it\u2019s like back-to-back-to-back-to-back. Australia, you have time to enjoy the moment before the next Grand Slam.\u201d \n \nWilliams also has wedding plans to make after her recent engagement to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who was courtside for her historic victory. \n \nShe revealed that elder sister Venus would be a bridesmaid, but not when the marriage would take place nor where. \n \nBut she said it was special having Ohanian by her side in Melbourne. \n \n\u201cHe\u2019s been so supportive in the stands. Although I never really heard him, even though I heard he was very boisterous,\u201d she said. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m so focused, I don\u2019t hear a lot. I have really selective hearing. It\u2019s nice to have that support. It is a wonderful feeling.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Fighting spirit propels Serena to tennis greatness","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Breitbart.com","feed":{"genre":"Press Release","tags":[],"id":"169657724","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6715"},"name":"Breitbart.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Wires"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.breitbart.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197213848","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

AG's dealers will receive an average of $1.85 million in a $1.2 billion settlement approved by a U.S. judge on Monday over its diesel emissions scandal. \n \nU.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said the 650 U.S. dealers would be paid over 18 months, ruling the settlement \"fair, reasonable, and adequate.\" \n \nVW also agreed to keep making volume-based incentive payments to dealers, and will allow them to defer capital improvements for two years. In total, VW has now agreed to spend up to $22 billion in the United States to address claims from owners, environmental regulators, U.S. states and dealers stemming from the excess vehicle emissions. \n  \nVW admitted in September 2015 to installing secret software in its diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and make them appear cleaner in testing than they really were. In reality, the vehicles emitted up to 40 times the legally allowable pollution levels and dealers say the resulting scandal tarnished the brand and cost them sales. \n \nVW North American Chief Executive Officer Hinrich Woebcken said earlier the company believed the agreement with \"dealers is a very important step in our commitment to making things right for all our stakeholders in the United States.\" \n \nBeyond the $1.2 billion cash payments, the settlement is valued at total of more than $1.6 billion for the VW brand dealers, said law firm Hagens Berman in a statement. The settlement includes $270 million through a provision for prior payments and $175 million in the continued sales incentives. \n \n\"The Volkswagen-branded franchise dealer class-action settlement finalized today represents an outstanding result for Volkswagen\u2019s affected franchise dealers who, like consumers, were blindsided by the brazen fraud that VW perpetrated,\" said Steve Berman, managing partner of Hagens Berman and lead attorney for the dealers.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Automotive industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Volkswagen news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Germany news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"European business news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. judge approves VW dealers $ 1.2 billion settlement","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Sify","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657349","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"Sify","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Financials","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sify.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197218594","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T12:42:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/rbyiFMhebdbge.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n Lawsuit is first challenge to executive order  \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n Released under special circumstances  \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n 'The executive order is unlawful'  \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n Legality questioned  \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US.

He's so aggressive, even if he's not a tall guy,\" Guardiola told his post-match press conference. \n \n\"It's the first game, so it's not easy for him to communicate. He doesn't speak English. He will need time. But he makes a lot of movements. The pass for the first goal is outstanding. \n \n\"We cannot forget, we play with 21, 20 and 21 (sic) -- three strikers so, so young. It's the future for Man City and all three played good.\" \n \nSane made a slow start to his City career following his close-season move from Schalke, but the Germany winger has now scored three goals in his last three appearances. \n \n\"He arrived a little bit scared, but it's normal when you arrive in a new country,\" Guardiola said. \"After the game against Arsenal (a 2-1 win on December 18) and his injury, they had four or five days off and he realised he had to make a step forward and he did it. \n \n\"Not just in terms of the goal, but his involvement in our game. Not just the actions, but the runs in behind, the quality and fighting. \n \n\"It's not easy for a player from another country coming here at 20, 21 years old and playing in a big club. Always he has to learn it's no option but to win, win, win.\" \n \nGuardiola was also pleased to see captain Vincent Kompany complete 90 minutes on his first outing since sustaining a knee injury during City's 2-1 win at Palace on November 19. \n \n\"That is maybe one of the better news tonight,\" said the City manager. \"He was a long time injured and every time he came back he could not finish 90 minutes. \n \n\"He was two years injured, but the doctors and the physios and (surgeon) Ramon Cugat made an exceptional job.\" \n \nSergio Aguero was absent for City with a leg problem and Guardiola said he would be assessed before Wednesday's Premier League trip to West Ham United. \n \nGuardiola said Toure, who arced a free-kick into the top-left corner in injury time, had been \"perfect\" since returning to the team in the November win at Selhurst Park, in which he scored twice. \n \nBut Palace manager Sam Allardyce took a dimmer view of the Ivorian's contribution, arguing he should have been shown a second yellow card for tripping Jordon Mutch midway through the first half. \"They should have been down to 10 men,\" Allardyce said. \n \n\"Mutchy had been booked for much less a couple of minutes before. So the referee has not done his job for me, on the incident that Yaya did there. \n \n\"On the consistency of what the referee was doing in the game, it was an absolute certain yellow card. But I'm much more concerned about the goals we are conceding at the moment, rather than the referee.\" \n \nAllardyce confirmed Palace were close to completing a move for Sunderland left-back Patrick van Aanholt, but played down reports winger Andros Townsend is poised to rejoin Newcastle United. \n \n\"I think Van Aanholt is close,\" he said. \"Hopefully he will be involved (at Bournemouth) on Tuesday, January 28. \n \n\"I've no idea what the situation is with Andros other than the chairman has told me there has not been any type of bid whatsoever from Newcastle. So that's not even in the back of my mind.\" \n \nAFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Manchester City news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"England news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Pep Guardiola revels in glimpse of Manchester City's future","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Oneindia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667805","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"54"},"name":"Oneindia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.oneindia.in/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.oneindia.com/topic/pep-guardiola","http://www.oneindia.com/topic/manchester-city","http://www.oneindia.com/topic/fa-cup","http://www.oneindia.com/topic/crystal-palace","http://www.oneindia.com/sports/football-leagues/"],"sequenceId":"695197222297","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:15:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Apart from him, Samoa Joe is also a confirmed one to make his debut during the Rumble event. \n \nAccording to the reports of Dave Meltzer from Wrestling Observer Newsletter, Joe is a confirmed name to make his debut on the main roster, tonight. Not only this, he is also set for a mega-match at Wrestlemania 33. \n \nThe veteran journalist also hinted that WWE might have already booked a big match between John Cena and AJ Styles at the biggest stage of them all. \n \nBoth of them goes way back when it comes to the beginning of their wrestling career. They both started in WWE\u2019s developmental territory UPW (Ultimate pro-wrestling). \n \nCena had a short stint in the developmental before moving into the main roster in 2002. Joe, on the other hand, would leave the promotion to join Total Nonstop Wrestling franchise i.e. TNA wrestling promotion. \n \nThe former NXT champion, Samoa Joe has earlier spoken about the relationship between him and Cena during their early days. These were his comments: \n \n\u201cWhen John was just getting started, we hung out a lot. Being a trainer at the school, I taught the beginner course. \n \n\"John was the type of guy, who even though he was past the basics, would come to beginner class in the morning. I would see him at the advanced class at night, where I would go to train and improve.\u201d \n \nWWE itself teased the feud by putting a video on their official Youtube channel, sometimes ago. Meltzer just pointed to this mega feud due to the recent developments from the backstage. \n \nSamoa\u2019s main roster debut is on the hold for quite sometimes and it does not get any bigger if he gets to wrestle none other than the franchise of the company. \n \nOneIndia News","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"South Pacific Islands news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"WWE Rumour: John Cena Vs Samoa Joe at Royal Rumble","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Oneindia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667805","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"54"},"name":"Oneindia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.oneindia.in/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.oneindia.com/topic/wwe"],"sequenceId":"695197226502","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:10:24Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I never have worked for the Red Wings. And odds are that I never will work for the Red Wings. \n \nThe only reason that I mention it is that I think the 25-year playoff streak matters a lot to the people who work inside the organization. I don\u2019t think that those of us who work outside the organization appreciate what it means to those people. This isn\u2019t an excuse, it\u2019s more of an explanation. For years, simply making the playoffs was a foregone conclusion for the Red Wings. It was merely a matter of where they\u2019d be seeded and who they\u2019d host in Game 1 of the first round. The last few years, it\u2019s been a matter of scratching and clawing their way in and sometimes relying on other teams losing to secure that final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. \n \nThis hasn\u2019t led to any postseason success. It clearly hasn\u2019t led to any deep runs in the spring. But as Ken Holland likes to infer, once you\u2019re in, anything can happen. The only problem is that \u201canything\u201d has been a series of first round losses with only one playoff round victory (2013) in the past five seasons and zero trips to the conference finals since 2009. \n \nIt\u2019s led to a weird dynamic in this town where the team is fighting to get in and the fans are saying, \u201cwhat\u2019s the point?\u201d \n \nRelated: \n   \nDETROIT FREE PRESS \n \nDetroit Red Wings' lineup getting healthier over break \n    \nDETROIT FREE PRESS \n \nDetroit Red Wings head into break at bottom of Eastern Conference \n  \nThat brings us to this season where the Wings enter the All-Star break tied for last place in the East. They\u2019re seven points out of both a wild-card spot and out of third place in the Atlantic Division. They\u2019re tied for the second worst goal differential in the conference (minus-21) and they\u2019re a preposterously good 6-0 in shoot-outs which A) inflates their point total and B) is a pretty risky way to go through the season. \n \nThere is nothing going on that would make you think that this is a playoff team. There\u2019s no hot goaltender. There\u2019s no dynamic scorer. There\u2019s no potential for an outlier where some player takes off and carries this team on their back. Is there a chance that the Wings can get hot and squeak into the playoffs? You never say never of course. But what\u2019s the point? \n  \nDetroit Red Wings GM Ken Holland.  (Photo: Kirthmon F. Dozier, DFP) \n   \nWe\u2019ve heard from plenty of fans that want to see the team tank in the second half of the season. To me, that\u2019s a ridiculous argument. Everybody from Jeff Blashill down owes it to themselves and to each other to try every night to win. That\u2019s the DNA of a professional coach and a professional athlete. \n \nAbove Blashill, namely Holland and his scouting staff, the focus must be on the moment the final horn sounds at the end of the April 9 game against the Devils. Buying at the trade deadline is out of the question. Standing pat at the deadline makes no sense when you have tradeable commodities like Thomas Vanek and Brendan Smith to put out on the open market. Holland needs to be an aggressive seller. Every fan has their personal list of untouchables, most of which include Dylan Larkin, Anthony Mantha and Andreas Athanasiou. Personally, not a single player is untouchable. The Red Wings need two Larkins and three Athanasious if they hope to get back to where this franchise once was. \n \nHaving said that, I\u2019d only trade the \u201cuntouchables\u201d at the right price. They can still be moved in the off-season or in the future. The players who need to go at the deadline are Vanek and Smith since their contracts are up at the end of the season and there\u2019s every chance they\u2019ll walk away regardless. \n \nThis is a rather somber way to mark the end of Joe Louis Arena. No building in Detroit has seen more glory than the Joe. But this is no longer about the building. If you want the Little Caesars Arena to ever approach the Joe in terms of important games played, you need to focus solely on the team and organization as a whole and less on nostalgia and the streak. \n \nThe streak is an amazing accomplishment. Just like the Stanley Cups and the retired jerseys, it can never be taken away and can never be altered. The streak represents consistency unmatched in the rest of the NHL. But the streak shouldn\u2019t define the next chapter in Red Wings history. This team has never, throughout it\u2019s great history, been about just making the playoffs. It\u2019s been about raising banners. The only way to contend for more of those is by building for the future starting immediately. \n \nAnything is possible in sports which is why a playoff berth is never dead until a team has been eliminated. But everyone who watches this team knows that it isn\u2019t Cup-worthy. And being Cup-worthy is far more important for the Wings than simply being playoff-worthy.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jamie Samuelsen, Special to Detroit Free Press"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NHL - Detroit Red Wings news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NHL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The time is right for Red Wings to be sellers at trade deadline","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cascade","zipCode":"59405","state":"Montana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Great Falls","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Great Falls Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661225","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1512"},"name":"Great Falls Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["IceHockey","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.greatfallstribune.com","publisher":"Gannett"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.freep.com/story/sports/2016/08/31/jamie-and-stoney-wxyt-fm-morning-show/89672340/","http://twitter.com/jamiesamuelsen/","http://www.freep.com/story/sports/nhl/red-wings/2017/01/27/detroit-red-wings/97148792/","http://www.freep.com/story/sports/nhl/red-wings/2017/01/26/detroit-red-wings/97078484/"],"sequenceId":"695197228763","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday, swelled to more than 2,000 people, including some celebrities. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n \n___ \n \nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n \nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \n \n___ \n \nDENVER \n \nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. \n \n___ \n \nCHICAGO \n \nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travellers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n \nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday. \n \nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n \nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n \nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n \nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" \n \n__ \n \nDALLAS \n \nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The Dallas Morning News reports the crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n \nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition. \n \nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n \nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \n \nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n \n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n \n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n \n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" \n \n___ \n \nSEATTLE \n \nAbout 1,000 pro-immigration protesters gathered Saturday at Seattle-Tacoma Airport to denounce Trump's executive order. Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. \n \n___ \n \nPORTLAND, OREGON \n \nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\" \n \n___ \n \nLOS ANGELES \n \nAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil. \n \n___ \n \nSAN FRANCISCO \n \nHundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport's international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. \n \n___ \n \nSAN DIEGO \n \nAs motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"V2A","state":"British Columbia","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Penticton","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Penticton Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664938","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Penticton Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pentictonherald.ca"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://NorthJersey.com/"],"sequenceId":"695197230522","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:48:16Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/pentictonherald.ca/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/f0/9f0e0bc3-30d7-5409-bb0c-4ba6af9f5a05/588d93539dfac.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200"}],"video":[]}}

Lots of people, whether they know it or not,\u201d Nadereh Pourat, research director for the UCLA Center for Health Policy, said. \n \nAt least 6,200 Humboldt County residents could lose their government-subsidized insurance policies under Covered California with another 18,400 residents potentially losing low-income health care coverage under the act\u2019s expanded Medi-Cal program, according to the Humboldt County Department of Health & Human Services. \n \nThe loss of these Medi-Cal patients would result in significant reductions in government reimbursements for the clinics, hospitals and providers that serve them. \n \n\u201cWe potentially have thousands of people that have coverage under this expansion that could potentially lose it,\u201d North Coast Clinics Network Executive Director Tim Rine said. \u201cThose individuals would now become uninsured, and our mission at our health centers is we see people regardless of their ability to pay. On the business side that means we wouldn\u2019t get reimbursed for those services. People aren\u2019t going to stop getting sick if they lose their insurance.\u201d \n \nThe scope of this impact locally would be far-reaching, officials stated, affecting mental health treatment, drug addiction services, the criminal justice system and access to health care not only for low-income patients, but also for those with private and employee-based insurance plans. \n \nDHHS Legislative and Policy Manager Nancy Starck said Humboldt County would have to bear the brunt of costs for treating uninsured individuals as it is the health care provider of last resort under state law. \n \nStarck said the reduction in Medi-Cal reimbursements would likely cut funds for preventative care programs and lead to an increase in reactive care treatment in emergency rooms and the county\u2019s mental health hospital Sempervirens. \n \n\u201cThat is a much more expensive form of health care than doing the preventative work,\u201d Starck said. \u201c... A lot of our services are geared to the most vulnerable people in our community and the most low-income who do not stand to benefit from repeal.\u201d \n Repeal and replace?  \nPresident Donald Trump has called for a replacement plan to be implemented immediately after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act takes place to prevent an estimated 20 million people from losing their insurance. But details on this plan have been scant as Congressional Republicans work to craft a plan that could accomplish Trump\u2019s goal of \u201cinsurance for everybody.\u201d \n \n \nWithin hours of taking the oath of office, Trump signed an executive order calling for the \u201cprompt repeal\u201d of the 2010 health care law. \n \nThe order gives federal agencies the ability cease issuing regulations to expand the law\u2019s reach and allows them to grant waivers, delays or exemptions to provisions of the law that would impose costs to states or individual people. This would include the nearly $700 fee that is imposed on people who do not carry insurance as is required under the act. \n \nAccording to the Associated Press, this order will likely not have any impact this year due to government rules for this year having already been placed into contracts with insurance companies. \n \nTrump stated in an interview with The Washington Post earlier this month that the replacement plan would provide \u201cinsurance for everybody.\u201d \n \nIn an effort to reduce federal spending, Trump\u2019s advisers have stated the proposed replacement plan would alter the national health care program Medicaid for low-income individuals. \n \nCurrently, the federal government pays states an agreed upon percentage of the state\u2019s Medicaid costs. Trump\u2019s plan would instead send states a fixed amount of money each year in the form of block grants \u2014 an idea advocated by congressional Republicans in past years. \n \nEureka-based Dr. Michael Fratkin of Resolution Care said this change would cause providers to restrict how they can spend their reimbursements, which he said will mostly affect the \u201cmost vulnerable, the most sick and the most poor people.\u201d \n \n\u201cThat will severely constrain our ability to pay for people\u2019s health care,\u201d he said. \u201cSo people will be hurt. Poor people will be excluded from high value, high class interventions. Rich people will get what they want.\u201d \n \nTrump also stated he wants the plan to retain other protections, such as requiring insurers to cover individuals with pre-existing conditions. Two Republican senators introduced what is expected to be one of many replacement plan proposals, which they said would allow states like California to keep the Affordable Care Act provisions if they choose or take part in a new program with reduced coverage. \n \nIf states decide against keeping Obama\u2019s statute, the senators\u2019 proposal would let them adopt a program that charges consumers a high deductible and helps cover some basic medical services like emergency care and prescriptions. \n \nInsurers would not be allowed to refuse coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions, and money states would get under existing law would instead go to patients in the form of a tax-advantaged health savings account they\u2019d use to pay for care. \n Local impacts  \nOf all the proposed changes to Obamacare, the potential elimination of the act\u2019s Medicaid expansion would have the largest impact locally. \n \nThe expansion allowed nearly 1.5 million more Californians to become eligible for the state\u2019s Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal, by eliminating age and disability qualifications and basing coverage eligibility solely on income, according to Starck. \n \nCurrently, more than 52,600 county residents are covered under Medi-Cal, with 18,400 or nearly 39 percent of them becoming eligible after the Medi-Cal expansion, Starck said. \n \nFratkin works to provide quality of life care for patients with serious or sometimes terminal illnesses. The majority of his patients are covered under Medi-Cal, the Medicare health care program for seniors, or an insurance policy from Covered California \u2014 the state\u2019s health insurance exchange. \n \n\u201cHaving insurance coverage that gives them access to available resources, particularly for cancer care, saves lives and extends lives,\u201d Fratkin said. \u201cIn the absence of that, they\u2019ll get to decide whether to buy their medicine or to buy their food.\u201d \n \nThe three clinic corporations in Humboldt, Del Norte and Trinity counties in North Coast Clinics Network \u2014 which includes Open Door Community Health \u2014 stand to lose \u201cmillions\u201d of dollars due to the potential loss of Medi-Cal reimbursements, according to Rine. \n \nWhile the actual cost is still being worked out, Rine said these losses could impact services for all of their patients of whom only 43 percent are covered under Medi-Cal. \n \n\u201cIf you remove one of the funding streams, you destabilize the infrastructure and access for all of us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about this population but the destabilization of access to everyone.\u201d \n \nNorth Coast Assemblyman and Assembly Health Committee Chairman Jim Wood (D-Healdsburg) said the state faces losing anywhere from $0 to $21 billion depending on how the repeal and replacement proceeds. \n \n\u201cHonestly, at this point, it appears that the federal government holds the fate of the Affordable Care Act in California in their hands,\u201d Wood said. \u201c... We\u2019re obviously very concerned.\u201d \n \nThe Medi-Cal expansion particularly benefitted single adults, which is a profile that applies to many criminal offenders, according to county Chief Probation Officer Bill Damiano. He said the expansion has allowed these offenders to access critical drug addiction treatment, mental health services and general health care services that weren\u2019t available prior to the Affordable Care Act. \n \n\u201cObviously if a repeal happened, we could potentially lose that, which would be a shame because those kinds of services are helping to stabilize our criminal offenders in the community,\u201d Damiano said. \u201cIf the federal dollars aren\u2019t paying for us to provide these services, the county will be paying for it. The burden will fall somewhere. I sure hope the Legislature thinks about the potential impacts because they could be quite extreme and have lots of unintended consequences.\u201d \n \nLocal hospitals would also have to bear significant costs if Medicaid payments are reduced or eliminated due to them having to \u201cabsorb the cost of uncompensated care associated with these newly uninsured individuals who need and receive hospital care,\u201d according to a December 2016 study submitted to the Federation of American Hospitals and the American Hospital Association. \n \nThe study\u2019s model found that between 2018 and 2026, loss of Medicaid coverage would result in hospitals losing $165.8 billion with another $289.5 billion being lost if Medicare reductions are implemented. \n \nEven with the Affordable Care Act in place, Providence St. Joseph Health Communications and Marketing Coordinator Arianne Aryanpur said the organization still spends hundreds of millions of dollars each year caring for uninsured or underinsured patients. \n \n\u201cWe hope that as Congress considers changes to the ACA, it will protect the newly insured and prevent disruptions in patient care,\u201d she wrote in an email to the Times-Standard. \u201cOur health system intends to have an active role in these conversations and to be a voice for those we serve, especially the poor and vulnerable.\u201d \n Who benefits?  \nThe Affordable Care Act has placed financial strain on some businesses due to insurance premiums increasing at an average rate of about 15 percent each year since it took effect, according to Jeff Pauli, owner and general manager of Pauli-Harbour Insurance Inc. and Anderson Robinson Starkey Insurance Agency. \n \nEmployers with 50 or more full-time employee equivalents are required under the Affordable Care Act to provide an \u201caffordable\u201d health plan, which means the employee\u2019s insurance premium cannot exceed about 10 percent of their gross income, Pauli said. \n \nPauli said these plans are common locally despite there being few large employers. \n \n\u201cThere are so many fees and taxes and mandates in a health insurance plan that drive the rates up and it\u2019s on the backs of the employer to provide coverage,\u201d Pauli said, explaining the impacts on businesses. \u201cEven if you\u2019re a small employer, you have to offer benefits to be competitive which most do and it\u2019s very expensive.\u201d \n \nPauli said there is also a \u201cfamily glitch\u201d in the Affordable Care Act in which an employee\u2019s dependents \u2014 who are not children \u2014 are unable to sign up for government subsidized health insurance through Covered California if the employee is signed on to their employer\u2019s \u201caffordable\u201d insurance plan. \n \nPauli said this leaves dependents \u201cout to dry\u201d as their only options are to either purchase private insurance or to sign on to the employee\u2019s group insurance plan, for which they would be required to pay 100 percent of their premium. \n \n\u201cThey are driving employers and employees to go on a plan that would cost them more money than they could get otherwise,\u201d Pauli said. \n \nStill, others state that the impacts of repealing the Affordable Care Act far outweigh the benefits. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s important that people understand what they stand to lose,\u201d UCLA Center for Health Policy\u2019s Nadereh Pourat said. \u201cPeople think that \u2018It\u2019s not going to impact me.\u2019 But it could really impact everyone.\u201d \n \nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.

Already, declining incomes and living conditions in the area saw the school plunge down the decile rankings. Last year, challenges with the school governance and leadership provoked the Ministry of Education into sending in a limited statutory manager to take control of the board of trustees. Principal Bill Kaandorp had to stand down due to ill health, and ultimately resign. And for good measure, the school hall suffered a severe fire in October. \n   \nNatasha Baker hopes to send her three-year-old son Michael to Linton Country School. She's set up a parents' group to support the school. \n   \nThe community might have been forgiven for turning their back on the school.  Some did. \n \n  \n   \n   \n   \n \nThere were 12 pupils at the end of the last year, who headed off to their summer holidays under the cloud of a series of crisis meetings about the school's future. Some went off to high school. Some moved to other schools. \n   \nLinton Country School has suffered more than its share of troubles. By ast month, it was on the brink of closure. \n   \nOn Wednesday this week, one will return. That's Cruiz. \n \nCruiz is the sixth generation of his family to go to Linton Country School; they weren't going to let go easily. \n \nAfter 127 years serving the district, the school came oh-so-close to closing at Christmas. The statutory manager, Laura Snowden, challenged the community: You want to keep your school? Well, step up. \n   \nCruiz Strickett's dad gardened, painted and cleaned in a last-ditch bid to keep his son's school open. \n   \nAnd they did. Cruiz's dad, Aaron Strickett, fixed the sandpit, tidied up the gardens, cleaned the drains and put up bright yellow school signs. Natasha Baker and other mums with pre-schoolers swung in to offer their help too. \n   \nThey fought. And the Ministry of Education agreed to let them keep the school open \u2013 at least, for now. \n \nBecause there is, if course, a question of real public interest here: Should the taxpayer continue bankrolling a school that has just one child on the roll? The school will get $158,000 in salaries and operations funding this year \u2013 you could put Cruiz through a degree at an Ivy League university for that kind of money.  \n \nUltimately the answer must be \"no\". It serves neither the public purse, the community, nor Cruiz himself, to continue propping up a failing school. \n \nThat is the ultimate answer. But the immediate answer is a resounding \"yes\".

Other key suggestions include measures to fast track NPA resolution, creation of a Central Corporate Repository and interest payment on CRR balance. \n \nBanks also felt interest subvention for farm loans should be parked with them in advance, as it takes 7-8 months for settlement of claims, leading to interest loss. \n \nThey also want the government to announce additional tax incentives for customers on term deposits, such as reduction in lock-in period for tax saver fixed deposits, and increase in tax exemption limit for interest income from term deposits. \n \nThe survey revealed that iron and steel, infrastructure and textiles continue to account for a large concentration of non-performing assets (NPAs). \n \nOverall, the number of banks reporting a rise in the level of NPAs is lower in the current round of the survey as against the preceding round. While 76 per cent of the participating banks reported a rise in the level of NPAs during July-December, 85 per cent had reported so for the preceding six month period. \n \nGoing forward, the key sectors identified by banks which could see a greater demand for long term credit include infrastructure, automobiles and food processing. \n \n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Banking news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Banks eyeing big-ticket reforms in Budget: Survey","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"DNA India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659516","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1346"},"name":"DNA India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197251032","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:53Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Ron Tolin \n   \nCEBU CITY - The University of the Visayas Baby Lancers rallied from a 19-point second-half deficit to stun the heavily-favored Sacred Heart School-Ateneo de Cebu Magis Eagles, 82-80, and take a 1-0 series lead in the best-of-three finals series of the 2017 SM-National Basketball Training Center Cebu Tournament on Saturday at the Capitol Parish Gym. \n \nStill down by 11 in the fourth, the Baby Lancers buckled down on defense and went to star forward Jancork Cabahug down the stretch to eke out the victory and come within a victory away from putting an end to the six-year dominance of the Magis Eagles of this tournament. \n \nCabahug finished with 26 points, nine in the fourth period including a gorgeous spinning lay-up that put them up, 81-78, with less than two minutes left in the contest after falling behind, 66-77. \n \nJJ Rosete added 12 while Beirn Laurente chipped in 10 in the hotly contested match. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t have any special instructions for the boys. I just told them to buckle down on defense. I even gave them free reign on offense, so long as they worked hard on the other side of the floor,\u201d said UV head coach Jun Pepito. \n \nThe Magis Eagles were rolling behind the hot shooting of Andrew Velasco, who scored seven straight to put them up, 56-37. However, disaster struck as Velasco fell hard on a layup attempt and suffered a deep gash on his chin and was not able to return to the match. \n \nUV quickly took advantage as they chopped the deficit down to six, 62-68, heading to the final stanza. \n \nThe Magis Eagles stemmed the tide, thanks to the contributions of little-used John Benedict Yu, who pumped in seven straight points to give them a 77-66 advantage. But the Baby Lancers fired 11 unanswered points to tie the match at 77-all, 3:09 left. \n \nJeremy Nacua gave Ateneo de Cebu its last taste of the lead with a free-throw but Jhiey Paraldo put UV ahead, 79-78, with a bucket off a hard drive along the baseline. \n \nCabahug then padded their lead to three, 81-78, with a foray down the middle that saw him shed his defender with a nifty spin move before banking the ball in. \n \nAteneo de Cebu had several chances to come closer but Colonia missed four straight freethrows before finally making two to pull them within one, 80-81, time down to 42.7 ticks. They even had a shot at regaining the lead but Errol Pastor mistimed his outlet pass which got picked off, leading to a freethrow by UV\u2019s Froiland Maglasang for an 82-80 Baby Lancer lead, 15.3 seconds to go. \n \nThe Magis Eagles final possession netted them two freethrows as big man Alex Visser was fouled on his putback attempt with just 1.4 seconds remaining. However, Visser cracked under pressure and missed both as time expired, handing UV the morale-boosting win. \n \nHowever, tempers flared even after the match as a commotion broke out during the traditional congratulatory rounds as Ateneo de Cebu alleged that Laurente puched Renzo Calumpang in the stomach. Cooler heads, though, prevailed, \n \nVelasco paced Ateneo de Cebu with 26 while Travis Mantua notched 13 points. Nacua had 10. \n \nFollow the writer on Twitter: @ForgetAboutJay","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Follow the writer on Twitter: @ForgetAboutJay"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"UV Baby Lancers stun Magis Eagles in opener of Cebu NBTC finals behind big comeback","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"PH","country":"Philippines"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Spin.ph","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"397979382","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"Spin.ph","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.spin.ph"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/ForgetAboutJay"],"sequenceId":"695197251214","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:25Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://contents.spin.ph/image/2017/01/29/jancork-cabahug-tolin.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

A plurality of more than 2 million \u201cpeople of America\u201d chose otherwise. \n \nRand Bishop \n \nHendersonville \n \nFormer president\u2019s legacy \n \nTo the editor: Here is how I view Barack Obama\u2019s legacy. \n \nPositive: \n \n1. A good husband and father. \n \n2. A very good speaker and a charismatic personality. \n \n3. Elected to be a U.S. senator from Illinois. \n \n4. Elected president of the United States twice. \n \nThese are outstanding personal accomplishments. \n \nNegative: \n \nAs president, he was not able to shape future events for positive outcomes. He was therefore reduced to characterizing these events in an almost delusional positive manner. The result of this was (of course) little positive change in the real world. \n \nIt is regrettable that because of a flawed political belief system a person with such great talent would accomplish so little for the citizens of the U.S. and the people of the world. \n \nTom Hadley \n \nHendersonville \n \nWomen\u2019s March in Asheville \n \nTo the editor: Your Opinion page cartoon Wednesday showing an angry, screaming woman at the Women\u2019s March on Washington is a far cry from the atmosphere at Asheville Women\u2019s March. We who live in Western North Carolina can be proud of the women and men who marched on behalf of the traditional American value of equality. \n \nThose of us from Hendersonville marched with people from Murphy, Waynesville, Weaverville, Mars Hill, Asheville and other towns. Thousands of us expressed our support for equality, civility, truth, integrity, diversity, peace and more. Organic farmers marched for the environment. Grandmas and grandpas marched for women\u2019s rights. Veterans marched for affordable health care. Church groups marched for reconciliation and openness. \n \nThere was no screaming, no cursing, no violence. \n \nHandmade picket signs expressed the gracious, generous spirit of the Asheville march. I copied only a few: \n \n\u201cThe rise of women does not mean the fall of men.\u201d \n \n\u201cSexism is a social disease.\u201d \n \n\u201cSaying \u2018no\u2019 to hate makes America great.\u201d \n \n\u201cMy body my choice.\u201d \n \n\u201cCompassion in action.\u201d \n \nWe ended the march by singing \u201cAmerica\u201d together as raindrops fell. \n \nWhile the Times-News published an angry cartoon, it completely missed the spirit of the march I took part in, which was filled with love and truth and the American way. \n \nSunny Lockwood \n \nHendersonville \n \nNot buying GOP\u2019s claims \n \nTo the editor: With this new incoming administration, I am worried about two phases of the medical insurance issue. From calls I made to their offices, I learned that both of North Carolina\u2019s Republican senators voted for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare). The problem is, the GOP has never had a plan to replace it despite trying to repeal it for seven years. \n \nI am also concerned about their so-called plans for the future of Medicare. I\u2019m a lifelong Democrat and I believed President Lyndon Johnson when he created Medicare in 1965 and said it would look after me and my medical needs in my old age. It worked for my grandparents and my parents. Why not for me, too? \n \nNow, congressional Republicans want to privatize the system. They want to give me a voucher and make me shop the private market \u2014 with very little protection. They promise me this will be better. \n \nSorry, this old guy isn\u2019t buying it. I\u2019ll be at the mercy of the insurance companies, and I can\u2019t use their promises of something better to pay my medical bills. \n \nPhilip Rakita \n \nHendersonville \n \nObamacare repeal process \n \nTo the editor: Don\u2019t allow any member of Congress to tell you Obamacare cannot be repealed completely because reconciliation must strictly deal with the budget. These claims are false! \n \nAll of Obamacare, including the insurance regulation provisions, has a budgetary impact. Obamacare insurance regulations are the main reason why premiums continue to rise and require taxpayer-funded subsidies. \n \nA precedent already exists for a one-provision reconciliation bill that fully repeals a piece of legislation. \n \nIf a senator raises a Byrd Rule point of order against a provision repealing the insurance regulations due to budgetary concerns, the Senate parliamentarian\u2019s word is not final. It is ultimately up to the presiding officer, and ultimately, the Senate as a whole. The parliamentarian is an employee of the Senate with the job of providing advice to the presiding officer on historical precedents, and the Senate then overrides this obstacle with a simple majority vote. \n \nAfter Obamacare is completely repealed, Congress can then pass a second budget for fiscal year 2018 that lowers spending levels and achieves other conservative priorities like consumer choice, strengthens the doctor-patient relationship, lowers costs and provides ample time to transition back to the individual market without losing coverage. No more excuses! \n \nJane Bilello \n \nHendersonville","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Sunday's letters: Electoral College's president","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Henderson","zipCode":"28792","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Hendersonville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"BlueRidgeNow.com","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"425710471","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"66"},"name":"BlueRidgeNow.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.blueridgenow.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197256792","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I\u2019m like: \u2018Where did you get those balls, kid?\u2019 For a lot of women, especially women who grew up between 1982 and the early 2000s, Barrymore is a particular kind of icon. She\u2019s the accessible rebel we all wanted to be, or be friends with. She\u2019s the child star of ET who hit the skids early and hard, and not only survived, but went on to be one of the most popular (and bankable) female stars of the past three decades. She appeared in, and often produced, the kinds of movies that are vital viewing for teenagers, from the trashy taboo-busting rebellion of Poison Ivy, to the triumphant high school romcom Never Been Kissed, to the moody angst of Donnie Darko. Plus, in her 20s, she seemed to hang out with the best bands, go to all the best parties and always looked like she was having the time of her life. She was the manic pixie dream girl before it became a tacky indie film stereotype. The memoir she wrote in 2015 is, appropriately, called Wildflower.\n\nShe looks genuinely pleased that she holds such a place in people\u2019s minds, and decides that if people do like her, \"If anyone has any goodwill towards me,\" careful not to sound arrogant, it\u2019s because she extends goodwill to other people. \"Not in an annoying way, but just, like, being in people\u2019s fucking corners.\" It\u2019s this combination of soft and sharp, all wrapped up in that valley girl lilt, that has carried her through life. \"I want people to be happy, but I know happiness has to be fought for. It\u2019s a warrior trophy. It\u2019s not hippy,\" she insists. \"I\u2019m like, fight. Fight to the death to be happy, and don\u2019t kill anyone along the way.\" \u2018Little riot grrrl\u2019: Drew Barrymore with Steven Spielberg at the age of five on the set of 1982\u2019s ET. Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Features We\u2019re in Germany to talk about Santa Clarita Diet, the new Netflix series which has brought her back into the spotlight again at 41. It\u2019s a warm and occasionally gross 10-part comedy about Sheila and Joel, estate agents who have been together since their school days, and whose marriage is tested when the amiable Sheila develops a sudden taste for human flesh.\n\n\"I stopped working to have my kids and take care of them and raise them, and so I was nervous about working again,\" she says. \"I was going through a dark time in my own life. And then I read it and I liked it. Now what am I supposed to do? I can\u2019t do this right now, it\u2019s terrible timing, my whole life is falling apart.\" She ended up executive producing it as well as starring.\n\nThat her life was falling apart out of the spotlight was a new thing for Barrymore, who had played out most of her life in a very public sphere. \"No one\u2019s talking about my life. I mean, yes, I had a divorce, but even that was real quiet.\" She split up with actor Will Kopelman, the father of her two children, Olive, four, and Frankie, two, at the beginning of 2016, but recently posted an Instagram of him running the New York marathon; she was there, with their daughters, to support him. \"It was like, \u2018Oh, they didn\u2019t work out, I wonder why? Oh my God they seem like such good friends, and so amicable, I guess we\u2019ll stop giving a shit.\u2019 I was so happy about that,\" she says, breezily. \u2018Warm and occasionally gross\u2019: Barrymore in Santa Clarita Diet. Photograph: Erica Parise/Netflix In the midst of her divorce, Santa Clarita Diet was a transformative experience. \"Ironically, it wasn\u2019t the worst timing. It was great. It was really happy. It was a good summer. My daughters and I got to go out to California and I got three days off a week.\" Just as becoming a proto-zombie saves Sheila from the numbing boredom of domestic life, Barrymore went through her own kind of rejuvenation. \"I feel like Sheila. I feel like maybe I was dead inside,\" she says cheerfully, blowing her nose. \"I don\u2019t know. I was in a place in my life where I had gained a lot of weight, and been in a place of fear and sadness, and I felt stuck. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s so much unlike the character.\"\n\nUntil she took time away from acting to have kids, Barrymore had never not worked. She began her career at 11 months in an advert for dog food, quickly becoming the main breadwinner for herself and her mother, Jaid, who raised her alone. Her father John Barrymore, of the Barrymore acting dynasty \u2013 \"The great line of loonies from which I come,\" as she puts it \u2013 wasn\u2019t around much. Her extraordinary youth was public and well-documented. Her breakout role in ET, at five years old, was followed by an outlandish few years of childhood boozing and drug-taking, rehab and institutions, and the sense that, at 14, she was washed up and her career was over.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t. She moved into an apartment by herself, got a job in a coffee shop, learned how to do her own laundry and, eventually, clawed her way back into the business, defeating the curse of the child actor where so many others have been lost. She has said her 20s were a kind of delayed adolescence. Now, in her 40s, she\u2019s had a lifetime\u2019s worth of parties and experiences, and says she doesn\u2019t miss it at all. \"I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m not at the centre of things. I don\u2019t worry about career stuff. I don\u2019t worry about who the hottest band is or that I\u2019m not at that show that night. I don\u2019t care if the latest trend is happening and it\u2019s just passing me by.\" Star quality: Barrymore with Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu in Charlie\u2019s Angels. Photograph: Image Net Her idea of a good time these days is taking the girls to Disney World, or \"setting up movie nights for the kids in my daughter\u2019s class. I just watched Home Alone and all the moms and I were crying at the end. Oh my God, it\u2019s so good! I appreciate it now much more than I did when I was younger.\"\n\nShe\u2019s too classy to be drawn into any child actor comparisons \u2013 it would be \"patronising, annoying, no thanks,\" she says, nicely but firmly \u2013 but we talk more broadly about celebrity scandals. \"Everyone goes up and goes down. That\u2019s life. Nobody wants all of it looked at and discussed. However, if you do put yourself out there, then you need to be prepared for that to be examined and you have to handle it to the best of your abilities. So for people who are like [she puts on a whiny voice]: \u2018Don\u2019t look at me\u2019 \u2013 you put yourself out there!\"\n\nIs there any way to avoid being examined and discussed? \"Not in this day and age. You just try to manage things in the healthiest way you can. And by the way? You won\u2019t all the time. You\u2019re gonna fuck up. So fuck up, then pick yourself back up. But just be nice and kind and humble and gracious and have a sense of humour. And don\u2019t pretend to be perfect.\" Golden girl: winning a Golden Globe for Grey Gardens in 2010. Photograph: NBC/ Barrymore dealt with her own initial fuck-ups in an incredible and startling \"memoir\", Little Girl Lost, which she wryly calls, \"The mea culpa book I wrote when I was 14.\" She appeared on Oprah with her mother to promote it, to go over what went wrong. You can watch it on YouTube; she\u2019s 15 going on 35. Yet the book has a cult following, in part because it makes all the partying she did as a young child sound kind of adventurous. \"Yeah! It\u2019s like an 80s cult tragedy book, which is super cool and wrong and fun all at the same time. It\u2019s a little riot grrrl, you know?\" I don\u2019t worry about career stuff. I don\u2019t care if the latest trend is passing me by There\u2019s a chapter where Barrymore describes being hauled off to an institution at her mother\u2019s behest, and she\u2019s furious at the starstruck guards. \u2018\"God, you\u2019ve just yanked me out of my house with cuffs on,\" I thought, \"and now you\u2019re asking me what it was like to meet ET. What jerks,\" she writes. Even at 14, she had a disdain for celebrity. \"Still do,\" she says, today.\n\nWe meet on the afternoon of Trump\u2019s inauguration. She plans to watch it later, as she\u2019s \"a total news junkie\", but she doesn\u2019t particularly want to talk about what she thinks of him. \"I\u2019m not a painter and I\u2019m not a musician and I think people don\u2019t want to hear it from actors,\" she says. \"I read this op-ed in the New York Times that was saying, just do things quietly, in your art.\" Slasher: Barrymore in Wes Craven\u2019s Scream, 1996. Photograph: Allstar Barrymore is more about the practical. During her screen break, she wrote Wildflower, which became a New York Times bestseller, and she\u2019s built a sizeable business empire, including Barrymore wines, a production company, Flower Films, and beauty brand Flower Cosmetics. All of which channel some of that free-spirit warmth into profits \u2013 reports suggest she\u2019s worth $125m. There\u2019s a line in Santa Clarita Diet where Sheila announces: \"I sleep two hours a night. I get so much done!\" It struck me that for Barrymore, spinning so many plates, that might be funny. Actually, she says, it was originally written that Sheila would use her spare time to learn French. \"Me, in my real life, would spend time learning French. This woman literally has a ticking clock on her mortality. She\u2019d be studying fucking Bruce Lee moves and learning to do shit.\" The line was changed at Barrymore\u2019s request: instead of learning a language, Sheila would get the ability to parallel park in one move. \"I\u2019m, like, yes! That\u2019s practical!\"\n\nIt\u2019s strange to see Barrymore, who seemed to be an eternal teenager, starring as the mother of a teenager in Santa Clarita Diet, partly because her fame is life-long, and you can see interviews with her at almost every age on YouTube. But, she says, she never watches them, never goes back. \"Hell no. The only thing I ever think when I see myself when I\u2019m younger, if I\u2019m on a talk show and I\u2019m stuck there having to watch clips, is that I was so much more brassy when I was young. I\u2019m like: \u2018Where do you get the balls, kid?\u2019\"\n\nShe says it as if those balls have disappeared with age. She claims she\u2019s much more polite now. Sarcastic, but polite. And worse still, she tries to say she\u2019s newly dull. \"In my life I\u2019m just so quiet and boring,\" she declares, not entirely convincingly. This is Drew Barrymore, after all, who talks with the hunger of someone who will always be on the lookout for something new, whether that\u2019s being a mother, a businesswoman, or playing a friendly estate agent who kills and eats bad people. \"I am pretty boring,\" she insists. I tell her I don\u2019t believe it. She smiles slyly, and leans in. There\u2019s a rebel in her still. \"I\u2019m not sure I believe it either.\"\n\nSanta Clarita Diet launches on Netflix on 3 February","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Rebecca

I'm not going to stir the hornet's nest, but a number of other teams have had the opportunity to control where they've played this year.\"\n\nAnother sticking point is training.\n\nUnited can train throughout the week at McKellar for minimal cost, but would get limited access to Canberra Stadium.\n\nLast time the Mariners were in town, Canberra played its season opener against Melbourne City as part of a Canberra Stadium double-header, losing that game 2-1.\n\nThey were unable to train on the ground in the lead-up to that match.\n\nUnited co-captain Ellie Brush reiterated Dower's preference, but added they'd be ready regardless of where the game was.\n\n\"This is our favoured home, but ... we don't really mind where we suit up, we know the crowd will get out and support us. Just two more [wins] to go,\" she said.\n\nDower said Brush's fellow co-captain Michelle Heyman was unlikely to be ready for the semi, although she had returned to training with the main group as she continued her comeback from toe and ankle injuries.\n\nThe Matildas striker has been out since she rolled her ankle against the Melbourne Victory at the end of December.\n\n\"She was back training [Friday], which was a great sight to see her out here at McKellar juggling, jogging laps, kicking the ball around,\" Dower said.\n\n\"It was really great. Next week might be asking too much, but at least she's back in the frame now and she's running herself around.\"\n\nW-LEAGUE SEMI-FINAL\n\nCanberra United v Melbourne City\n\nA-LEAGUE ROUND 18\n\nSunday: Central Coast Mariners v Adelaide United at Canberra Stadium, 5pm.

A certificate was issued by the Circuit Court in April 2013 but the company which was in charge of both premises was dissolved in 2014. \nMiss Diver from the Revenue explained that, although Mr McLaughlin has a tax clearance certificate, the company owns both licences and they have not been able to go to court and get the court clearances. \"The licence hasn't been renewed,\" she added. \"The court cert that was issued in 2013 was for a company that has ceased trading.\" Discussions are ongoing with a view to regularising all matters, she stated. \nSupt. Colm Nevin said it was \"unacceptable\" that a pub would trade so long without a licence. \nJudge Kilrane adjourned both cases to May 5 saying he hoped that the licences will all be in order by then.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Ireland news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Donegal pub has been operating for eight years without a full licence","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"IE","country":"Ireland"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Donegal Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170114236","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Donegal Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie","publisher":"Johnston Press"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197262452","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect.

At 14 stone 6Ibs, the Cork native was ready for change so she applied to become a leader on the Operation Transformation. \n \nBut perhaps her greatest achievement is managing to maintain and continue her new healthy lifestyle after the cameras stopped rolling. \u201cI finished the show on 12 stone 10Ibs and I went on to lose a further 1 stone 4Ibs afterwards,\u201d she says. \n \n\u201cI had been overweight my entire adult life. l had enough of feeling horrible about myself and not being happy in my own skin. My middle son, who is now four years old, was only two weeks old when I decided to apply for the show.\u201d \n \n\n \nFor Deirdre, Operation Transformation was a learning curve like no other and it gave her the opportunity to gain a new perspective on diet, life and exercise. \n \nShe admits that she was at her heaviest \u2013 17 stone \u2013 when she was in her 20s, but it was the mental barrier of failure that was initially holding her back when it came to achieving her weight loss goals. \n \n\u201cI learned a lot from my experience on OT. Firstly, you can\u2019t do exercise on a bad diet, so it has to be a combination of diet and exercise together. The second thing I learned was to give myself a break and to stop negative thoughts about \u2018bad\u2019 foods or that I had somehow failed by being overweight. They were some of the hardest hurdles to overcome in succeeding with my weight loss,\u201d she recalls. \n \n\n \nWhile she is one of the programme\u2019s success stories, the mother-of-three admits she would have mixed feelings about appearing on a similar type of television show again. She found it \u201cdraining\u201d being followed by a cameraman day in, day out. \n \n\u201cThe support I received from the public was amazing and very humbling. They were with me every step of the way and of course the show changed my life completely,\u201d says Deirdre. \n \n\u201cBut on the down side, it is very full-on with a cameraman with you five days a week, 10-12 hours a day, and then filming in RTÉ Dublin for the other two days. I still watch the show with so much sympathy and empathy for the leaders.\u201d \n \nThe busy mum was so delighted with her weight loss both on and off Operation Transformation that it spurred her on to become a personal trainer so she could help others fulfill their goals. \n \nBut it is not all about the physical results and simply looking good, her main priority is feeling healthy in both mind and body. \n \n\u201cRight now, being a personal trainer, I don\u2019t strive for the perfect body. I aim to be healthy for my family and lead a balanced life,\u201d admits Deirdre. \n \n\u201cI have also learned to come to terms with my body. I know that I will never be a size 8, but I am happy with the way I look now and the hard work I have put in to get here.\u201d \n \nAccording to Deirdre, it\u2019s thanks to shows like Operation Transformation \u2013 which aims to cull the growing problem of obesity and poor diets that are causing havoc in our health system \u2013 that the nation is getting active again. \n \nShe explains: \u201cIf Ireland continues on its current trajectory we would be one of the fattest countries in the world in five years. That is a scary prospect when you consider that our children are now becoming affected too and also our hospitals are filling up with people with diseases that are directly linked to obesity. \n \n\u201cI think shows like OT are important to raise awareness for this issue. Take one look at the amount of people who watch that show and get out in groups to go walking every year \u2013 it is fantastic awareness and correct information is the key to helping the nation be more aware.\u201d \n \noperation transformation \n \nRefusing to focus on the show\u2019s negatives, Deirdre walked away from Operation Transformation a changed woman. \n \n\u201cFor me, the biggest positive was the new-found confidence in myself,\u201d she admits. \n \n\u201cBeing a leader allowed me to do things that challenged and scared me. I couldn\u2019t take a back seat because I would feel everyone was looking at me.\u201d \n \nThe post appeared first on RSVP Magazine .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Mikie O'Loughlin"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: celebrity gossip","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Operation Transformation: Deirdre Hosford\u2019s success revisited","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"IE","country":"Ireland"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"RSVP Magazine","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"370019653","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"RSVP Magazine","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle","Gossip"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://rsvpmagazine.ie"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197275026","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:17Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://rsvpmagazine.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FB_IMG_1482338899792-508x1020.jpg"},{"url":"http://rsvpmagazine.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/operation-transformation.jpg"},{"url":"http://rsvpmagazine.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/1483451901792-600x973.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

For just the second time this season, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish are on a losing streak after falling 62-60 to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets on the road. The loss is Notre Dame\u2019s first against an unranked opponent this season, all though the Yellow Jackets (who took down Florida State earlier this week) are no cakewalk. \n \nHere is what we learned from Saturday\u2019s deflating defeat: \n The Irish have tasted their own medicine, and it is bitter!  \nThis isn\u2019t supposed to happen! For much of this season, it was the Irish who found a way to steal a win in the game\u2019s final seconds. The tables were turned on Saturday as Georgia Tech secured the rebound off a missed jumper from Matt Farrell . The outlet pass to Josh Okogie resulted in a game-winning layup as time expired, sending McCamish Pavilion into a frenzy. \n \nIt may not be fair as fans, but it is hard to find the Irish in a situation like this late in the game and not expect them to pull out a win. They simply couldn\u2019t get the job done on Saturday in a situation where they usually excel. VJ Beachem and Matt Farrell had opportunities to provide the dagger with three-pointers in the closing minutes, but couldn\u2019t connect from long range. Now, it will be a long flight home for Mike Brey and co. \n Notre Dame in an offensive slump?  \nIt was without a doubt a sloppy affair when the Irish were crushed by Virginia on Tuesday, but given the reputation of the Cavaliers\u2019 defense, the 54 points scored by the Irish wasn\u2019t too concerning. However, after scoring just 60 points on Saturday against a weaker defense, it is becoming apparent that the Irish may have lost their way a bit on the offensive end. \n \nBeachem and Farrell actually shot the ball very well from beyond the arc, aside from the most needed ones in the closing minutes. After being silenced by Virginia, Beachem poured in 23 points on Saturday in the losing effort. But while Beachem bounced back, Steve Vasturia struggled, posting his least productive game of the season with just five points on 1-7 shooting. Farrell struggled a bit from the floor as well, connecting on just five of his 14 field goal attempts. \n \nThe largest concern would be the free throw shooting, which really turned out to be the difference in this game. The Irish, who have been known as one of the best teams in the country from the charity stripe, converted on just 63.6% of their free throws. In a conference like the ACC, taking advantage of free throw attempts is a must when you are likely to find yourself in close games down the stretch. Most of the free throw trouble came from Austin Torres and Bonzie Colson , but I would expect them to rebound in time to greet Duke on Monday. \n Thanks to the crazy ACC, this loss is slightly more bearable  \nThis is absolutely a tough loss. All conference road games are tough, but you always want to record wins against unranked opponents. However, after seeing how the rest of the conference fared on Saturday, it is a little easier to swallow the loss. \n \nMiami throttled first place North Carolina at home. Syracuse downed Florida State at home, and Duke did not seem to find an energy boost after coach K\u2019s tirade, as they struggled with Wake Forest. Upsets of this nature are bound to happen in a conference of this caliber. That being said, this will be a huge week for the Irish to get back on track before a frustrating week turns into a long-term state of panic.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: college basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Notre Dame vs. Georgia Tech: Three Things We Learned","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Yard Barker","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"459817831","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Yard Barker","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.yardbarker.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/teams/notre-dame-fighting-irish","http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/teams/georgia-tech-yellow-jackets","http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/players/251956/matt-farrell","http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/players/283199/josh-okogie","http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/players/263124/matt-farrell","http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/players/229093/steve-vasturia","http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/players/229095/austin-torres","http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/players/251959/bonzie-colson"],"sequenceId":"695197281509","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:46:54Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It was first published in the 1905 Christmas issue of the magazine Harper's Bazaar, and in book format in June 1906 by Harper and Brothers publishing house. It is written in the style of a diary kept by the first woman in the biblical creation story, Eve, and is claimed to be \"translated from the original MS.\" The \"plot\" of this novel is the first-person account of Eve from her creation up to her burial by, her mate, Adam, including meeting and getting to know Adam, and exploring the world around her, Eden. The story then jumps 40 years into the future after the Fall and expulsion from Eden. It is one of a series of books Twain wrote concerning the story of Adam and Eve, including 'Extracts from Adam's Diary,' 'That Day In Eden,' 'Eve Speaks,' 'Adam's Soliloquy,' and the 'Autobiography of Eve.' Eve's Diary has a lighter tone than the others in the series, as Eve has a strong appreciation for beauty and love. The book may have been written as a posthumous love-letter to Mark Twain's wife Olivia Langdon Clemens, or Livy, who died in June 1904, just before the story was written. Mark Twain is quoted as saying, \"Eve's Diary is finished \u2014 I've been waiting for her to speak, but she doesn't say anything more.\" The story ends with Adam's speaking at Eve's grave, \"Wherever she was, there was Eden.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Eve's diary","source":{"category":"Corporate","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Scribd","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"243896142","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"390"},"name":"Scribd","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Organisations","CompanySite"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.scribd.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197281933","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:52:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It is considered to be his most prominent work, known both for its length and its theme of involuntary memory, the most famous example being the \"episode of the madeleine\" which occurs early in the first volume. It gained fame in English in translations by C. K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin as Remembrance of Things Past, but the title In Search of Lost Time, a literal rendering of the French, has gained usage since D. J. Enright adopted it for his revised translation published in 1992.The novel began to take shape in 1909. Proust continued to work on it until his final illness in the autumn of 1922 forced him to break off. Proust established the structure early on, but even after volumes were initially finished he kept adding new material and edited one volume after another for publication. The last three of the seven volumes contain oversights and fragmentary or unpolished passages, as they existed only in draft form at the death of the author; the publication of these parts was overseen by his brother Robert.Also Available in Black Horse Classics1 - Mark Twain2 - Charles Dickens3 - William Shakespeare4 - Jane Austen5 - leo Tolstoy6 - Jack London7 - Rudyard Kipling8 - H.G Wells9 - Marcel Proust10 - Victor Hugo11 - Fyodor Dostoyevsky12 - Jules Vernes13 - Thomas Hardy14- Joseph Conrad15 -Oscar Wilde16- Herman Melville17 - Edgar Allan Poe18 - Henry James19 - Lewis Carroll20 - Hans Christen Andersen","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Marcel Proust: In Search of Lost Time \"volumes 1 to 7\" [Classics Authors Vol: 9] (Black Horse Classics)","source":{"category":"Corporate","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Scribd","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"243896142","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"390"},"name":"Scribd","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Organisations","CompanySite"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.scribd.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197282610","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:51:21Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Two primary features of the app include the ability of users to easily renew their passport and their ability to take passport photos \n  \nNew York , United States - January 29, 2017 /PressCable/ \u2014 \n \nItsEasy.com, a leading provider of passport and visa expediting services founded by visionary David Alwadish in 1976, is revolutionizing the passport and visa expediting industry with their passport renewal app. \n \nWith the 10-year anniversary of the Western Hemisphere Initiative passed in 2007, requiring Americans to have a passport for air travel to and from Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, the U.S. State Department expects to have approximately 16 million passport renewals in 2016 and 20 million in 2017 \u2013 an unprecedented amount. With the ItsEasy app, U.S. passport holders will have the power and convenience of facilitating their passport renewal process at their fingertips at any location \u2013 at home, at work, anywhere \u2013 with their iPhone/IPad and Android. \n \n\u201cThis is truly an exciting time for ItsEasy. We\u2019ve been working on this app for quite some time; perfecting it, adding new components to it and bettering it in general. I wanted to create an app that allowed U.S. passport holders to renew their passport with ease from their iPhone in a beneficial, secure, and easy way,\u201d said David Alwadish, CEO and President of ItsEasy.com. \u201cThis is truly an app that all passport holders should have downloaded for free on their iPhones, and Androids. The app is more than a passport renewal app and includes other features such as passport photos, visa requirements, an emergency info button (for travelers who lose their passport or visa while in another country), and a passport renewal reminder feature that will remind users via email to renew their passport nine months before their passport expires.\u201d \n \nThe free for download ItsEasy Passport Renewal App is safe, secure, confidential, user friendly, and is based upon the company\u2019s exceptional 40-year reputation. The two primary features of the app include the ability of users to easily renew their passport, and their ability to take passport photos which are then reviewed and approved by qualified ItsEasy passport professionals. Travelers in need of only photos have the option to have their passport photos printed by ItsEasy and delivered by first class or overnight mail, or have them emailed electronically to be printed by the user. \n \nWhen using the app, prior to the applicant\u2019s passport renewal order being completed, and in addition to the Department of State\u2019s passport fee, ItsEasy charges an honest fee of $29.95 for their services. Considering the value, the price is well worth the investment. The passport photo feature alone saves $10-$15 as well as the savings in time, travel and wait at the post office or drugstore for passport photos. Additionally, the app features trackable priority United States Postal Service shipping label a cost savings of approximately $6.45 and 24/7 customer support plus the peace of mind of knowing you used the correct forms and order status updates. Users are provided with the choice of two renewal processing time frames \u2013 standard approximately (6 to 8 week) and expedited (2 to 3 weeks.) \n \nOnce the order is completed through the app, ItsEasy will instantly email the customer the correct passport application to be printed and completed, a simple checklist and a secure trackable USPS priority shipping label to send the documents into ItsEasy for reviewing and processing. The professionals at ItsEasy will then deliver all necessary documents to the U.S. Department of State, who issues all passports and passport cards. \n \nAlwadish added, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want an app that saves you precious time and money? Between buying the envelope, postage, passport photos and running around for the errand, if the value of the users\u2019 time saved is factored in then the savings would grow exponentially! We are providing you with peace of mind with government approved and regulated experts handling the entire process\u2014including pre-checking of documents, printing the photos, writing the check and gathering what you\u2019d have to go buy yourself \u2013 you\u2019re in safe hands and we can advise you every step of the way. I can confidently say that you\u2019ll be aware of where your application is at all times.\u201d \n \nIn addition to the 10-year anniversary of the Western Hemisphere Initiative approaching, creating the passport renewal surge, the U.S. Department of State also recently announced the elimination of visa page inserts for U.S. passports beginning this year. Previously, U.S. passport holders had the option to pay for the insertion of additional 24-page visa inserts when valid passports lacked adequate space for entry or exit visa stamps. However, now applicants in need of additional pages in their passports will have to obtain a renewal \u2013 making this app even more relevant for U.S. travelers. \n \nFor more information on ItsEasy, the new app and other services, visit the website at https://www.itseasy.com/ or call 1-866-ITS-EASY.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2370","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Glen Innes","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Glen Innes Examiner","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"271689926","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Glen Innes Examiner","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gleninnesexaminer.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197313390","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"true","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 5 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sacramento","zipCode":"95814","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Sacramento","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KCRA.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662541","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"522"},"name":"KCRA.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kcra.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197313645","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States.\n\nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion.\n\n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN.\n\n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\"\n\n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added.\n\nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained.\n\nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\"\n\nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\"\n\nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order\n\nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n\nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK.\n\nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states..\n\nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n\nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days.\n\nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted.\n\nReleased under special circumstances\n\nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order.\n\nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n\n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\"\n\nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US.\n\nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013.\n\nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss.\n\nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action.\n\n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\"\n\n'The executive order is unlawful'\n\nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military.\n\nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal.\n\n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers.\n\nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied.\n\n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read.\n\nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n\nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss.\n\n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC.\n\nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times.\n\nLegality questioned\n\nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States.\n\nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000.\n\n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\"\n\nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained.\n\nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n\n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\"\n\nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.\n\nTM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

He's one of the staff members, part of an increasingly grey workforce in an increasingly grey country.\n\n\"I enjoy talking to the people here. It's fun, but it's also hard work,\" Odaira said during a break from his caregiving duties on a recent day.\n\nJapan is considered a \"super-aging\" society. More than a quarter of the population is over 65, a figure set to rise to 40 percent by 2050. The average life expectancy is 85, and that means many Japanese remain relatively healthy for a good two decades after retirement age.\n\nAt the same time, the birthrate has plummeted to well below the level needed to keep the population stable. Now home to 128 million people, Japan is expected to number less than 100 million by 2050, according to government projections.\n\nThat means authorities need to think about ways to keep seniors healthy and active for longer, but also about how to augment the workforce to cope with labor shortages. At Cross Heart, more than half of the 119 caregivers are over 60, and 15 of them are over 70.\n\n\"When we advertise for people to work here, we get lots of responses from older people, not younger people,\" said nursing home director Kaori Yokoo in the lobby where residents were doing leg curls and chest presses on weight machines.\n\nThe foundation that runs this nursing home and others in Kanagawa Prefecture has raised the official retirement age to 70 but allows employees to keep working until 80 if they want to and can. Municipalities around the country are also actively recruiting people over 60 to do lighter duties at nursing homes.\n\nIt's one way of dealing with the problem. Meanwhile, researchers are working on robots that can lift the elderly out of beds and wheelchairs, and inward-looking Japan is slowly coming around to the idea that it may need to allow in more foreign workers.\n\nAlthough older workers have constraints - some can't do the heavier tasks - they also offer advantages over younger workers who want time off for their children, said Yokoo, who is 41.\n\n\"Plus, because they're close in age to the residents, they can relate to each other more,\" she said. \"We younger people think this must be nice for them. Older staff can understand things like physical pains more because they are living through the same things.\"\n\nSome of the older workers here are doing it because they need the money. For others, the money is a nice benefit, but the main motivation is the activity and sense of community.\n\nKiyoko Tsuboi, a 95-year-old who comes into the rest home during the day, said she likes having Odaira around.\n\n\"He's very attentive to our needs and knows things like how hot we like our tea. My son is not as kind as Odaira-san,\" Tsuboi said as Odaira cleared away the lunch dishes. \"He's quite active despite his age, and even though he's a man, he has an eye for detail.\"\n\nThe dynamic works well for Odaira, too, who started here 17 years ago after retiring from his job in the sales department of an auto parts maker. He works eight hours a day, four days a week.\n\nHis father died when he was small, his mother when he was 22. \"It's not like I'm replacing my mother, but I thought I could help someone else's parents,\" he said.\n\nHe also does it to stay young, Odaira said with a twinkle in his eye. \"I think it's good for me physically and mentally, so as long as I can keep working, I will.\"\n\nHe's not the oldest worker here, though. That title is shared by two 78-year-olds, a man who works in the office, and Noriko Fukuju, who helps with pickups and drop-offs and does activities with \"the old people.\"\n\n\"It's fun. I enjoy it,\" she said.\n\nHiroko Akiyama, at the University of Tokyo's Institute of Gerontology, said a Japanese 65-year-old is in much better physical and mental shape than a 65-year-old a few decades ago. \"They are full of energy, and healthy and long-living,\" she said.\n\nAkiyama's research has found that working helps keep seniors that way. \"They operate on a regular schedule. They wake up, get ready, go to work and talk to people and stay connected,\" she said. \"We had a depressed old woman who changed completely after she started working.\"\n\nStill, Japan can't rely solely on seniors or, potentially, robots to staff its nursing homes, where the need will only grow as the population ages, analysts say.\n\nJapan has agreements with Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines under which applicants who complete job training and pass a Japanese language test can work at a Japanese nursing home.\n\nBut if they want to stay beyond three years, they must pass a national caregiver's exam so difficult that 40 percent of Japanese applicants fail. Many Japanese also express concern about cultural differences.\n\nNext year, the Japanese government will loosen the regulations slightly and set up a technical intern program, but there will still be time limits and difficult tests to pass.\n\nPerhaps 2,000 people will come to Japan through the intern program, said Yasuhiro Yuki, an expert on elderly care at Shukutoku University. \"But we hear we will need 300,000 more caregivers in the next 10 years,\" he said. \"So I still don't think we will have enough.\"\n\nThat means aging caregivers will increasingly become the norm.\n\n\"I can do this at least for two more years,\" said Fukuju, the 78-year-old, before she dashed out the door to renew her driver's licence.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ANNA FIFIELD"},"topics":[{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Staff as grey as the residents","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Stuff.co.nz","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662685","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Stuff.co.nz","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stuff.co.nz/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197322706","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/g/x/0/t/v/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.620x349.1gx0b5.png/1485675166369.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Photo: RNZ/ Jane Patterson \n  \nThey already have at least one clear division - over whether or not New Zealand should remain in the Five Eyes intelligence network. \n \nIn a symbolic move, Labour and the Greens launched their election year campaigns with their first joint State of the Nation event in Auckland today. \n \nSpeeches by Labour leader Andrew Little and Greens co-leader Metiria Turei contained no new policy, but sent a message to voters the two parties will work closely this year. \n \nMr Little was asked if New Zealand should stay in Five Eyes after comments made by the US President Donald Trump about sanctioning the torture of terror suspects. \n \nHe said Labour supported staying in the network, and that had not changed under Mr Trump's presidency. \n \n\"Five Eyes is about getting information that helps with the security of our nation. \n \n\"New Zealanders care about making sure they're safe and secure.\" \n \nMs Turei said the Greens had always opposed New Zealand's involvement. Their view remained unchanged. \n \n\"We've had different views on this for many, many years and you don't expect other parties to have exactly the same policy and on this. \n \n\"We disagree, that's perfectly fine, we can still work together to change the government.\" \n \nMr Little said no decisions have been made about electorate deals with the Greens in seats such as Ohariu and Auckland Central, but discussions were under way. \n \nHe said he had talked to the former Police Association President Greg O'Connor about a possible candidacy. \n \nMr Little would not comment about whether Mr O'Connor could stand in Ohariu - a seat currently held by the leader of one of National's support partners, United Future's Peter Dunne. \n \n\"I've known Greg for a long time and I've spoken to him myself, more recently... They were conversations, but I talk to a lot of people and most people want those conversations to be kept within the spirit of what they take place, which is, you know, a sounding out, showing an interest - and that's kind of as far as it's got.\" \n Housing, jobs top priorities  \nIn their State of the Nation speeches, both Mr Little and Ms Turei emphasised the \"shared values\" of the two parties, while launching an attack on the National-led government and new Prime Minister Bill English. \n \nWhile introducing the speakers, comedian Guy Williams talked about politics overseas and the \"man who shall not be named\"; then asked the interpreter for the deaf to show the audience how to sign Donald Trump - she obliged with a flick of the hand at her forehead (denoting a certain infamous hairstyle). \n \nTo an audience of about 300 to 400 Labour and Green supporters in a hall in Mt Albert, Mr Little talked about his personal battle with cancer. \n \n\"It made me think about seizing opportunities; about making the best of this life. \n \n\"My battle with cancer colours everything I see, even today.\" \n \nMr Little laid out his party's campaign priorities of jobs, affordable housing and a better standard of living. \n \nHe alluded to politics in the United States, saying with \"President Trump in the US, and the Far Right in Europe - holding onto a positive, inclusive vision is more important than ever\". \n \nMr Little criticised Mr English, calling him a \"competent bean counter\" and saying since taking office he had \"failed the first tests of leadership\" by refusing to commit to fighting harder to reduce poverty, or solve the housing crisis. \n \nHe said Mr English should front up in Waitangi next weekend, and that he should have sacked his friend and Cabinet colleague Nick Smith in last year's reshuffle. \n \nMs Turei acknowledged the former party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons for her environmental campaigns and the battles of the late Helen Kelly for employee rights. \n \nShe talked about the walk out in Parliament last year by female Green and Labour MPs in response to accusations by then-Prime Minister Jon Key that opposition MPs were \"backing the rapists\" during a debate over New Zealanders held in detention in Australia. \n \n\"That was a moment when our parties stood together and stood up for our values. \n \n\"I don't need to ask the values of the people here. Or to look up feminism in the dictionary, unlike Bill English. \n \n\"I don't need to ask whose side we're on.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Greens and Labour divided over intel network","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Radio New Zealand","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169699817","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"66"},"name":"Radio New Zealand","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.radionz.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197329753","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Mother wanted 'Antony' but my Dad spelt it 'Anthony' when he registered me.\"\n\nA third chimed in: \"I'm wondering if Clohe's mam was just dyslexic?\", while another said: \"Watching The Chase and wondering if Clohe's parents liked but couldn't spell the name\".\n\nHowever, it wasn't just her moniker which sparked criticism. Her performance also left viewers feeling underwhelmed.\n\nOne witty person said: \"Clohe's as good at answering these questions as her parents were at spelling her name,\" while another said: \"Clohe is as silly as the spelling of her name.\"\n\nAdding insult to injury, she also lost £1,000 for her team by accepting the minus offer. One viewer fumed: \"If they win any money Clohe needs to pay Catherine a grand for taking the minus!\".\n\nAs if things couldn't get any worse, the 28 year-old also revealed a rather bizarre phobia - of salad. When asked about holidays by host Bradley Walsh, she said: \"I went on my first holiday with my boyfriend to Valencia to La Tomatina, which is a tomato throwing festival.\n\n\"But I'm a bit scared of tomatoes.

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2370","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Glen Innes","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Glen Innes Examiner","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"271689926","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Glen Innes Examiner","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gleninnesexaminer.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197332115","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"true","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

that is looking into the influence-peddling and corruption scandal involving President Park Geun-hye and her friend is likely to seek an arrest warrant again for Lee Jae-yong, sources said Sunday. \n\nThe team, led by Special Counsel Park Young-soo, is mulling over whether to again try to get an arrest warrant for the Samsung Group's de facto heir apparent after it finishes a face-to-face investigation of the president early next month.  \n\n\"Since this is the last chance (to seek a warrant), we will be perfectly prepared to do so,\" a person from the team told Yonhap News Agency. Under the law, the team's investigation will be wrapped up at the end of February, although it is possible for it to be extended for another 30 days.  \n\n  Lee Jae-yong (Yonhap)  \nOn Jan. 19, a local court rejected the issuing of an arrest warrant for the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics Co. on charges of bribery, embezzlement and perjury. The team believes that Lee ordered his company to give tens of millions of dollars to the president's friend Choi Soon-sil in return for the state-run pension fund's backing of a merger of two Samsung affiliates.  \nThe court said at that time, \"It is hard to find a reason, necessity and appropriateness for the arrest at the current stage,\" \n\nadding that key issues, such as whether the money was for any kind of reciprocal favors, are still debated.  \n\nLast weekend, the team summoned Hwang Sung-soo, a senior executive at Samsung Electronics and vice chairman of the Korea Equestrian Federation, for questioning over Samsung's role in supporting Choi's daughter, Chung Yoo-ra.  \n\nIt also called in several people, including a former official at the federation and a former coach for Chung, to investigate what illegal requests, if any, Samsung Group made in return for huge financial support for Chung. \n\nIt is said that the team has secured pieces of circumstantial evidence that Samsung voluntarily supported Chung by, for example, promising her a new expensive horse, which is against its former claims that it was coerced by the president to cough up the money. \n\n(Yonhap)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"South Korea news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Special prosecutor likely to seek arrest warrant again for Samsung heir Lee","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Eastern Asia","countryCode":"KR","country":"South Korea"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Korea Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668373","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9835"},"name":"Korea Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","National","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.koreaherald.com","publisher":"Herald Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197337618","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He responds regularly to accidents, suicides, shootings, domestic struggles, and various other incidents where the police officers and citizens involved can benefit from a caring presence and compassionate support. Corky is regularly tasked with delivering the life-altering news of the death of a loved one and with providing critical support at that most painful moment. \n \nOur local men and women in law enforcement also know Corky French as a dear friend, a listening ear, an arm to lean on, and sometimes a shoulder to cry on. \n \nHe\u2019s also been my friend for over a decade. I thought it was time for you to get to know him too. \n \nCorky, we\u2019ve seen in TV shows and movies where a policeman or a military officer appears at the door of a home to deliver tragic news to a family. Typically we see a spouse or parent\u2019s sudden realization of why the man in uniform is present. We see the shock and instant grief \u2026 and then the scene changes. For you the scene does not cut away, it follows you into the house and into the living room. What can you tell us about happens in that room? What is that experience like for you? \n \n\u201cThe scene is generally horrific. I have just given them information that will change their life forever. The responses range from stoic, shock, denial, anger, rage, physical violence, and even passing out. I have been physically attacked. \n \n\u201cI have picked people up off the floor. One person would not quit holding onto my face because they did not believe that I was real, that the news and the moment was real. \n \n\u201cAfter dealing with the initial reaction, I move to allowing them to absorb the news. When they have settled in a little, I begin to try and surround them with family, friends, and their pastor if they have one. Actually, few seem to have a pastor or have one they feel they can call, so I often fill that role too. I frequently make the calls to family or friends due to the person\u2019s emotional condition. I generally do not leave until they have some supportive people there around them. \n \n\u201cI, or the officer that accompanies me, try to answer the numerous questions that they might have about what happened. Eventually, I go over with them what will happen next and what they will need to do (few people know what happens after someone dies and the processes that must be gone through). The \u201cnot knowing what is next\u201d is very difficult, and I try to relieve them of that uncertainty. \n \n\u201cThroughout the entire process, I try to be as compassionate, patient, understanding, supportive and loving as I possibly can. If they are people of faith, I point to their faith as a source of strength, and often at that point in their lives, survival. When possible and appropriate, I spend some time praying with them before I leave. I might spend anywhere from 30 minutes to five hours with a family after delivering this news. When appropriate and feasible, I try to follow up a few days later to check on them.\u201d \n \nMost of us cannot fathom doing even once what you do on a regular basis. Why do you do it? \n \n\u201cSimply put, it is an opportunity to bring light into a very, very, dark place. God has something to offer, even, or maybe especially, to this kind of devastating moment. The information has to be delivered. I want to do it in a way, and deal with it in a way that brings God to the moment through me. I want to do more than just deliver information. I want to bring something to the moment. The mission of our ministry is to bring help, hope, and healing to the broken, bruised, wounded and often invisible or forgotten of our community. You don\u2019t get much more broken, bruised and wounded than when receiving this type of news.\u201d \n \nWhat are the hardest visits to make?    \n \n\u201cThey are all hard. You are delivering the worst news possible. There is pain, regardless of the situation. But, the calls that involve children or young people tend to be the worst. Our community has been hit hard recently by several deadly vehicle accidents involving teenagers. I have been involved in some of those. They were extremely tough.\u201d \n \nYou also get called to the tragic scene itself on occasion. What\u2019s your role there? \n \n\u201cFirst, at the scene I want to make sure that my law enforcement officers are OK. They\u2019re human. This stuff is hard for them as well. They have families. They have feelings. No one should have to see and do the things that they must do. But they stand in the gap and do whatever needs to be done. I provide any support and help that I can at the scene. I also gather all the appropriate information that I need to effectively deliver the notification.\u201d \n \nHow does this work not take its toll on you? \n \n\u201cFor me personally, it\u2019s excruciating work. I have seen unspeakable physical trauma in my ministry. But dealing with the emotional devastation of the families is the most difficult part for me. The immediate trauma for them is overwhelming. I\u2019ve learned, and have been trained in, how to deal with this myself. I know there are certain things I have to do to take care of myself when I deal with such stressors. I am blessed to be surrounded by a strong support group and a great family. These things, and moreover my faith, allow me to deal with these things regularly and stay healthy. But, this kind of trauma is cumulative, and after 17 years I know that it has affected me.\u201d \n \nYou are a chaplain to police officers. What difficulties do people in law enforcement deal with that the general public doesn\u2019t see and understand?   \n \n\u201cLaw enforcement is one of the top-three most stressful professions in the world. A lot of factors play in to that. Never has it been more so than now. The cultural environment, lack of support from national \u201cleaders,\u201d fake news, social media and other factors have made their jobs even more difficult. They deal with the worst of the worst. They work in difficult environments. As I said before, they have to see and deal with things that no one should have to. They have to make split-second decisions. Everything that they do is scrutinized to the nth degree. \n \n\u201cIn the big picture they\u2019re just human like me and you. Most see what they do in law enforcement as a \u201ccalling.\u201d Most go into law enforcement to try and make a difference. They are overworked and underpaid. Most work a second job, and many a third, just to get by. They are sons, daughters, husbands, wives, parents, and have families and lives just like us. At the end of their shifts, they just want to go home safe to their families. Just like us.\u201d \n \n**For more information about this and other services provided through Community Outreach Ministries visit w ww.CommunityOutreachMinistries.org . \n \nLearn how you can be involved and serve as a volunteer.

But first, a few things to establish the tone. Mr. Trump is neither the savior nor the devil. He is a frail, fallen, fearfully and wonderfully made and broken and boastful and image bearing and imperfect and talented and sinful and misguided and intelligent and rude and brash and inflammatory and paradoxical man whom God decided \u2014 in his infinite (and, indeed, mysterious) wisdom \u2014 should occupy the most powerful office in the world. \n \nWhatever hope some might be placing in Mr. Trump to be the answer to the world\u2019s problems, such hope is misdirected, as only Jesus has the power to change the world with all of its complexities and social problems and thorns and thistles. Conversely, whatever crippling despair others might be feeling over Mr. Trump fails to account for the fact that Jesus is still firmly seated on his throne, holding the hearts of all kings in his hands, including this one. \n \nThis is not to say that for Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, there is absolutely nothing positive to celebrate about his new role as president (there are some legitimate positives). Nor is it to say that for those who have deep concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s new role, there is nothing to be concerned or bothered by (there are some legitimate concerns). \n \nThe sole question I would like to address here is, what is the Christian\u2019s role, and what should be the Christian\u2019s posture, toward a new president \u2014 toward any president? The answer is, on the top level at least, the same for Mr. Trump as it is for each and every leader before and after him. Meaning\u2026 \n \nFirst, our baseline should be to pray for Mr. Trump and all national, state, and local leaders as the Scriptures lead us to do. Let\u2019s affirm him when he makes decisions and supports initiatives that help advance the common good. Let\u2019s refrain from insulting him personally, but look for ways to speak respectfully because of the office he occupies, in a similar way that young David insisted, \u201cI will not raise my hand against my lord; for he is the Lord\u2019s anointed.\u201d (2 Samuel 24:10) Of course later on, it was the Lord himself who rejected Saul as King, but until such time, David, out of respect for God\u2019s sovereign care over all of history, looked past the man Saul to the office he occupied, and, more importantly, to the God who saw fit for Saul to fill that office for a time. \n \nSecond, where a more prophetic voice is called for, let\u2019s speak truth to power (note the combination of both honor and prophetic, confrontational concern in David toward Saul in 1 Samuel 24:8-15) \u2014 in some cases even resisting and confronting policies and directives where conscience requires, especially where the unborn and born vulnerable are made more vulnerable and the voiceless are kept silent. And yet, because of the office held by the man, Christians especially must always do so with honor and dignity and respect. Daniel demonstrates this honoring posture with Babylon\u2019s Nebuchadnezzar, for example, while also refusing to submit to the king\u2019s idolatrous laws, at great cost to himself. And there is of course Peter and Paul, who wrote that Christians should look for every opportunity to show honor to Rome\u2019s self-serving, self-exalting, citizen exploiting Caesar, even as they refused to pledge ultimate allegiance (for only Jesus can rightly command such loyalty), which ended up costing them their lives. With this teaching from Scripture, Christians should have great pause about ever participating in \u201cNot My President!\u201d speech concerning a man that Scripture says is a leader God, as the Orchestrator of history (His-Story), has appointed through an election process, for this next season of history\u2026 \n \n[God] changes times and seasons; \nhe deposes kings and raises up others. \n(Daniel 2:21) \nLet everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God\u2026Give to everyone what you owe them\u2026if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor. (Romans 13:1-7) \n \nMany Christians, sadly, did not at all heed these biblical imperatives with the previous Obama administration. Perhaps we can learn from that mistake, so as not to repeat it, with this and all future administrations. \n \nFinally, wherever government may fall short of achieving truth, beauty and justice in the land \u2014 and this will always be the case until the Forever King (Jesus) returns to occupy his cosmic throne \u2014 let\u2019s be the kinds people, that our King has called us to be, regardless of who is in power. And if ever a government hands us lemons, let\u2019s not be sour but instead seek to make lemonade. Let\u2019s live as salt. And light. And a city on a hill that cannot be hidden. Let\u2019s live as those who are filled, renewed, and sent by the Spirit into the world, that we may leave the world better than we found it. Lets bring hope and relief and justice and belonging to the world in ways that government falls short. To whatever degree possible, let\u2019s live toward making government unnecessary by the way we spend our lives for the love of God and the flourishing of every neighbor. Let\u2019s live in such a way that if the light of Christ in us was suddenly removed from the places where we live, work, and play, the world would notice and be sad about our absence. For as CS Lewis aptly said, those who end up doing the most good for the present world are the ones who think the most of the next. The citizens of Jesus and his kingdom, in other words, must seek to be the very best and most life-giving citizens of earthly kingdoms. \n \nNow, without further adieu, I am pleased this week, with the author\u2019s gracious permission, to share the following post-inaugural prayer (with meditation-worthy Scriptures cited throughout) created by my friend and Washington, DC pastor, Duke Kwon\u2026 \n \nGRACIOUS GOD, \n \nWe pray on behalf of our nation this day, as Mr. Donald Trump is sworn in as the 45th President of the United States. Sovereign Lord, we \u201clift up our eyes to you, to you who sit enthroned in heaven\u201d (Ps. 123:1). \n \nWe pray for our new President (1 Tim. 2:1-3). As he takes the Oath of Office, we pray he may do so with humility, a clear conscience, and due consideration of the weightiness of so solemn a responsibility (Jer. 4:2; Ps. 24:4). As President Trump begins the execution of the Office, we ask that you would bless him with \u201cthe fear of the Lord\u201d \u2014 a reverent sense of dependency and accountability that would become a well-spring of wisdom (Prov. 9:10). Please protect the President from the many seductions of power: the will to \u201cwin\u201d at all costs (Mk. 10:42-45), retaliation towards enemies (Rom. 12:17-21), exploitation of the weak (Prov. 22:22), failures of faithfulness to one\u2019s covenant of marriage (Mal. 2:14). In particular, we ask that you would guard the President\u2019s marriage. May his devotion to his wife Melania grow and flourish. \n \nWe ask that you would give the President the character and skill to lead our nation effectively. Restrain all foolishness and evil in the meditations of his heart, the words on his lips, and the work of his hands (2 Thess. 2:7; Eccl. 4:13; Matt. 15:18-19). Pour into his heart such virtues as prudence, compassion, and self-control (Gal. 5:22-23). Make him a lover of truth (Ps. 51:6). Grant him grace to repent of wrongdoing when needed (2 Tim. 2:25). We also ask that you surround the President with friends and advisors who are just and wise (Prov. 19:20). \n \nPlease direct and \u201cchannel\u201d the President\u2019s heart, guiding it according to your Word and will (Prov. 21:1). We pray that the policies of President Trump and his administration would promote human flourishing in our nation and around the world. We ask you to grant President Trump your justice and your righteousness (Ps. 72:1, 12-14). In the coming four years, please protect the most vulnerable and marginalized members of our nation, whether through this administration\u2019s policies and priorities or in spite of them. Send your Spirit and pour out your loving-kindness upon the orphan (including the functionally parentless), the poor, the immigrant and the refugee, the unborn, the elderly, the racial minority (black and brown neighbors in particular), and many others who are too often diminished and forgotten (Deut. 27:19; Ps. 139:13-16; Prov. 14:31; Zech. 7:10; Jas. 1:27). Indeed, we are bold to ask, by your kind providence, that by the end of the term of this Presidency, our nation would be by certain measures more equitable, more compassionate, more humble, more generous, and more alive to your great grace. Jesus, could you please do this? Not because we are righteous or because we deserve it, but because of your mercy (Dan. 9:17-19). \n \nWe pray for ourselves, too. We ask that you would \u201cinaugurate\u201d in our hearts a readiness to offer whatever honor that is due to his Office (Rom. 13:1-7; 1 Pet. 2:17) \u2014 not least, for those who are followers of Christ, by praying for the President with earnest petitions and appropriate thanksgiving (1 Tim. 2:1-3). Help us to remain zealous to do good (Gal. 6:9). Keep us vigilant against evil (Rom. 12:21; Gen. 4:7). Save us from both political triumphalism and apocalyptic despair. Sustain our hunger and thirst for righteousness and grace (Matt. 5:3-6). \n \nAnd we continue to pray for our nation\u2019s healing after a terribly divisive election. Yes, we pray for civic unity, particularly among Christians of divergent political persuasions (Jn. 17:20-21). But even more so, we ask for grace for the process by which unity is forged. We pray for truth-telling, charity, empathy, repentance, and mutual understanding. We pray not for a negative peace marked by an absence of tension or disagreement, but a positive peace marked by the presence of hope, equity, and a Godward regard for one another as fellow image-bearers. Heal us, O Emmanuel. \n \nO Lord, on this Inauguration Day we place neither our ultimate trust nor our ultimate fears upon President Trump, a \u201cmere mortal\u201d whose heart is directed and re-directed by your sovereign will (Prov. 21:1; Isa. 40:23; Ps. 56:4; 146:3-4; Matt. 10:28). \u201cOthers besides you have ruled over us, but you alone do we worship\u201d (Isa. 26:13).

Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991. \nIn a section, titled 'The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy', the report says \"In our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\" besides \"a fanatical Hindu\". \n \nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2567","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Narellan","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wollondilly Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"346769048","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Wollondilly Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wollondillyadvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197348930","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Terrorism news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"New counter terrorism role slammed as 'against the public interest'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2567","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Narellan","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wollondilly Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"346769048","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Wollondilly Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wollondillyadvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695197350066","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:29:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/ee974bdb-c7e3-4991-93f1-8b638bee948c.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

They\u2019re co-ordinating with private attorneys and firms that have volunteered to help. They\u2019re reviewing statutes, setting priorities and seeking donations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all-out war,\u201d said Vermont Law School Professor Patrick Parenteau. \u201cIf you\u2019re an environmentalist or conservationist, this is indeed a scary time.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s first week in office only heightened their anxieties. He moved to resume construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines that the Obama administration had halted, while signalling intentions to abandon his predecessor\u2019s fight against global warming, vastly expand oil and gas drilling on public lands and slash the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s budget.\n\nGOP lawmakers, meanwhile, introduced measures to overturn a new Interior Department rule barring coal mining companies from damaging streams and to remove some wolves from the endangered species list.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve wasted no time in doing bad things,\u201d said Pat Gallagher, director of the Sierra Club\u2019s 50-member legal team, which he said is likely to grow as environmentalists increasingly regard the courts as their best option, even though success there is far from certain.\n\nThe Department of Justice, which represents the federal government in environmental lawsuits, declined to comment, while the White House did not respond to emails seeking comment. Doug Ericksen, communications director for Trump\u2019s transition team at EPA, said of the environmentalists that he\u2019s \u201cnot sure what they think they\u2019re preparing for\u201d but suspects they are stoking fear of Trump as a fundraising tool.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re more concerned about raising money than protecting the environment,\u201d Ericksen said.\n\nJim Burling, litigation director for the Pacific Legal Foundation, a non-profit property rights group that sues regulators on behalf of businesses and landowners, also contended environmental groups were exaggerating the Trump administration\u2019s threat for political and financial gain.\n\nThe government bureaucracy is entrenched, Burling said, and, \u201cwho happens to occupy the White House hasn\u2019t made that much difference.\u201d\n\nEnvironmentalists say their fears are justified by the new administration\u2019s antagonism toward government\u2019s role in keeping air and water clean and the planet from overheating.\n\nDonations began increasing after Trump\u2019s election, \u201ceven before the fundraising letters were sent\u201d asking for support to fight the administration\u2019s actions, said David Goldston, government affairs director at the Natural Resources Defence Council.\n\nEarthjustice, which has represented the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in its fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline, has about 100 staff attorneys and plans to bring more aboard, said Tim Preso, who manages the group\u2019s Northern Rockies office.\n\nThe Chicago-based Environmental Law & Policy Center is adding four attorneys to its pre-election staff of 18 and is co-ordinating with more than a dozen outside attorneys who would file citizen suits against polluters for free if agencies fail to enforce existing rules, said Executive Director Howard Learner.\n\n\u201cWe cannot fully substitute and replace the EPA doing its job,\u201d Learner said. \u201cBut on the other hand, we\u2019re not going to default to zero if the EPA steps backward when it comes to clean air and clean water enforcement.\u201d\n\nOn inauguration eve, five law professors filed a brief in support of a 2015 regulation giving EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers discretion to regulate tributaries and wetlands far upstream from navigable lakes and rivers to protect water quality.\n\nDozens of states have sued to block the rule \u2014 including Oklahoma, led by state Attorney General Scott Pruitt, now Trump\u2019s choice for EPA administrator \u2014 saying it gives government too much power over private property.\n\nShortly after Trump took office, his White House webpage listed the rule among \u201charmful and unnecessary policies\u201d he would target.\n\n\u201cIf the Trump administration won\u2019t defend the rule, I want to stand alongside environmental groups and do what I can to defend (it),\u201d said David Uhlmann, a University of Michigan law professor and former Justice Department prosecutor, who helped file the brief.\n\nGoing to court is just one tactic environmental lawyers will use, said Erik Schlenker-Goodrich of the Oregon-based Western Environmental Law Center, which also plans new hires. They will monitor agencies for failure to enforce pollution law or cutting corners when writing permits for activities such as oil and gas drilling, he said.\n\nThe Sierra Club\u2019s Gallagher, who sued over oil drilling beneath national parks during the George W. Bush administration, said another tactic would be making liberal use of open-records laws to obtain scientific data and other materials that might otherwise be purged. The group already has requested records on climate change from the EPA.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised at what they\u2019re doing, but maybe a little surprised at how fast and furious it\u2019s all happening,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cBut we were bracing for it and we\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFlesher reported from Traverse City, Michigan.\n\n___\n\nFollow Webber and Flesher on Twitter: https://twitter.com/twebber02, https://twitter.com/JohnFlesher\n\nWe've sent an email with instructions to create a new password.

The railroad saw a record number of passengers in 2016, even though cruise ship coach passengers are trending down. \n   \nIn 2016, the railroad had 494,236 total passengers and that number is expected to increase another 5 percent in 2017.  \n   \nThe amount of freight shipped on the Alaska Railroad has declined 44 percent since 2008 when the recession hit, declining from 6.599 million tons of freight per year to 3.71 million tons of freight in 2016. \n   \nO\u2019Leary said the closure of the Flint Hills oil refinery in North Pole \u2014 combined with Usibelli Coal Mine\u2019s export operation in Seward going into cold storage \u2014 has had the greatest impact on freight shipping. \n   \nDespite the drastic decline, O\u2019Leary said freight remains the Alaska Railroad\u2019s No. 1 source of revenue.  \n   \n\u201cHow can we restructure the revenue streams to be successful in this difficult environment?\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \n   \nO\u2019Leary said changes would be coming to the Alaska Railroad, but safety and service would not be compromised. \n   \nHe would not elaborate.  \n   \n\u201cWe are a big deal in a state woefully devoid of structure,\u201d he said.  \n   \nHe also discussed actions the railroad has taken to increase revenue: \n   \n\u2022 Railroad officials have committed to better use of their property. Alaska Railroad owns more than 36,000 acres of land. Half is used for operations, while the other half is available for lease and other uses. A large development is being built on leased railroad land in Anchorage. O\u2019Leary said no plans are in place for subdivisions on railroad land in the Fairbanks area. However, officials are considering creating a wetlands mitigation bank with its Interior properties. He said this could be beneficial for developers.  \n   \n\u2022 The railroad introduced the Hoodoo Choo Choo last year, offering beer tastings and light snacks during a trip to Nenana.   \n   \nContact staff writer Kevin Baird at 459-7575.
