Ian Woodcock \n \nFor those not familiar with the term, \u2018Frontier Markets\u2019 refer to equity markets (usually in smaller nations) that are at earlier stages of political and economic development than larger, more mature emerging markets. \n \nTypically, frontier equity markets have modest market capitalisation and limited liquidity, but possess favourable demographics and have very good opportunities for long-term growth. \n \nOverlooked by many investors in recent years in spite of improved economic performance, frontier markets are still a segment of the equity model that is traditionally missing from most portfolios. \n \nHowever, many frontier funds are still trading at a discount to both emerging and developed markets, meaning now could be the perfect time to buy.  Below, I have provided a brief summary of the better-known frontier markets, and what 2017 could bring. \n \nArgentina \n \nRecent political changes have helped pave the way for an economic resurgence in Argentina, although even the president himself admits a complete recovery will take some time. \n \nA country with an abundance of natural resources and wealth but a history of wastefulness and miss-management, it seems the foundations may finally be in place for Argentina to re-emerge as a powerhouse in Latin America. \n \nEconomists expect inflation to be vastly reduced in 2017, and GDP to grow by as much as 3%.  After a long period of foreign investors climbing over each other to get money out of the country, we are now finally seeing capital moving in the other direction again, and the finance ministry has tallied over $32 billion in foreign corporate pledges. \n \nFrom an investment perspective, valuations are still relatively cheap, and now is the time shrewd investors will enter the market before domestic growth accelerates further and valuations rise. \n \nVietnam \n \nVietnam boasted domestic growth of almost 7% in 2016, making it among the fastest growing markets in the world.  In a relatively subdued global economy, perhaps domestic demand is king, and Vietnam is combining this with a huge influx of foreign investment to very good effect. \n \nA bold socio-economic plan for 2016-20 is targeting a continued 7% annual expansion, meaning it is set to out-perform most of its peers.  In addition, new regulatory and structural reforms are helping to add depth and liquidity to the markets, and 2017 looks to be another strong year. \n \nPakistan \n \nAlthough Pakistan continues to suffer from security and corruption problems, as well as from power outages, the IMF has indicated that the government has succeeded in pulling the country out of recent crisis and stabilising the economy. \n \nInterest rates are still way down, meaning positive news for risk-based assets, and 2017 could see the country upgraded to emerging market (EM) status.  I would expect to see some setbacks during the course of the year, but, overall, 2017 should still see exciting times and continued growth. \n \nFrontier Europe \n \nFrontier markets in Europe could see improved fortunes in 2017, although much of this depends on improving eurozone growth and the stability of relations with Russia. \n \nA positive Russian market could add liquidity and reduce volatility to a very reasonably priced and neglected market, but I would be wary of sudden and explosive changes sparked by geo-political events. \n \nGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) \n \nThe general consensus seems to be that all six GCC countries will experience a continued slowdown in 2017.  The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar should outperform their neighbours due to a lesser dependency on oil (UAE), and continued public-sector spending ahead of the FIFA 2022 World Cup in Qatar helping to drive domestic growth. \n \nAnalyst company BMI Research predicts average oil prices for 2017 to average around only $57 per barrel, and large budget deficits in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman will ensure they lag behind, dragging overall GCC performance down. \n \nIf oil price projections turn out to be too conservative, the region could experience much better than expected performance.  Otherwise this is a frontier market to be cautious of, certainly for the next 12 months. \n \nIn summary, frontier markets could well hold the key to some of the best opportunities for growth in 2017, although, as always, you should carefully consider options before investing.  Low market valuations in key sectors indicate great potential entry points to the market, and there is no reason why frontier funds could not play a part in a well-structured portfolio, particularly with a longer-term investment view. \n \nThe writer is Investment Consultant at Chase Buchanan:

Shane Bond on fire in a ten wicket win in Wellington; chasing down 336 at Eden Park; and Craig McMillan's century - the fastest by a kiwi - helping the Blackcaps seal a stunning whitewash in Hamilton. \n \nThe scenes at Seddon Park when Brendon McCullum hit the winning runs are unforgettable, and kiwis celebrated beating the old enemy like there was no tomorrow. \n  \nAll this against a team without Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist, Andrew Symonds, Michael Clarke and Brett Lee.  \n \nBear that in mind over the coming week. Usman Khawaja's preparing for tests against India. David Warner - the top-ranked one-day batsmen in the world - needs a rest. \n \nAnd skipper Steve Smith's nursing a sore ankle. The Blackcaps will face a watered-down Australian side for the Chappell-Hadlee trophy, but it doesn't matter. Australia is Australia and, in any case, the Chappell-Hadlee series is all about us.   \n \nThe Aussies don't care. Their fans are apathetic. The crowds for the series across the ditch earlier this season were awful. So what?! \n \nThat's Cricket Australia's problem, not ours.  \n \nWhat is our problem is ensuring the Blackcaps remain competitive with the big brother, and with that in mind it's important they bounce back from the three-nil defeat across the ditch last year and win this series.  \n \nIf New Zealand Cricket - the players, the fans and the administrators - want the Chappell-Hadlee Series to have a future, then it's vital the Blackcaps perform on home soil against our fiercest rival. \n \nThe reason this series is on the calendar is because it guarantees three big gates for NZC, but it'll only continue to be a regular fixture if New Zealand can keep things competitive on the field. \n \nKiwis love their one-day cricket as much as they hate the Aussies, and in an age where bilateral cricket series often struggle for context and meaning, this is perhaps the only series that really matters to the fans. \n \nBut if New Zealand can't remain competitive against Australia, then the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy that fans and players covet will be left to gather dust in a cupboard in Melbourne as other nations and more lucrative series take priority for Cricket Australia.  \n \nThere's a point to prove for New Zealand in this series. There's a point to prove for the players who failed in Australia, for Ross Taylor whose runs were sorely missed across the Tasman, and for Kane Williamson who has a chance to outwit a rookie skipper in Matthew Wade and claim the big scalp his captaincy reign needs.  \n \nAussie allrounder Glenn Maxwell said earlier this week that New Zealand were a different side without Brendon McCullum, and that the team lack \"explosive, scary, unbelievable power at the top\". \n \nIt's clear that Australia no longer see the team as the threat they once were. A simple task that can be easily completed without their best players.  \n \nSounds a bit like 2007 all over again.  ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Chappell-Hadlee series: the only one that matters","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Newshub","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"602226314","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"36"},"name":"Newshub","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://feeds.feedburner.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198462381","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We can save the PC vs console arguments on another article, since the new generation of game consoles released in the past year at now (almost) at par with high-end gaming PCs. \n \nFirst off, the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 being to the current crop of eighth-generation consoles, but years after they were released we were treated to new upgrades in the likes of the PS4 Pro and the upcoming Project Scorpio. These consoles were not made to be replacements to the current generation, but cited as alternative options for gamers who want more powerful hardware. \n \nLet\u2019s talk numbers. The recently released PS4 Pro achieves 4.2 teraflops, enough for some games to be rendered in 4K or depending on how developers make it, improve graphic fidelity and visuals. \n \nProject Scorpio was announced to support up to 6 teraflops \u2013 meaning that it will top out all other consoles once it is released. To compared, Nvidia\u2019s latest GTX 1080 graphics card supports 10-11 teraflops. \n \nThat would mean games will look better than ever. And with the recent push for 4K support on games, you can now enjoy games on a much higher resolution. But just like the PS4 Pro, you would need a compatible display to be able to appreciate the performance upgrade. \n \nProject Scorpio\u2019s specifications (8-core AMD processor, 320 GB of memory bandwidth, and 6 teraflop GPU) are truly impressive, though we\u2019d only appreciate it more once we see gameplay sampled from the console. \n \nMicrosoft only mentioned Project Scorpio\u2019s release date to be this holiday season, and there is a good chance that this high-end gaming console won\u2019t be cheap. The company did say that the console is for gamer who won\u2019t have a high-end Windows 10 PC. \n \nWhen you look at it, spending money on Project Scorpio would technically be cheaper than upgrading or buying a new gaming PC.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Game On: Why we can\u2019t wait for Project Scorpio","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"T3 Middle East","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"347389765","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"T3 Middle East","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Games","Recreation","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.t3me.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198463366","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Some of it was the result of U.S. companies shifting manufacturing operations to countries with lower wages. Maytag is an example of this. In 2004, Maytag shut down its refrigerator manufacturing plant down the road from us in Galesburg and shifted production to Reynosa, Mexico. \n \nThat, however, is only part of the story. Much of the job loss is the result of increased use of robotics and automation. When I first visited the John Deere Harvester Works plant in East Moline in the mid-1970s, highly-skilled welders were hard at work welding together various components of the combines the plant was manufacturing. Workers in protective gear were spray-painting parts for the combines, either John Deere green or yellow depending on what the blueprints called for. Today, much of the welding is done by robots while an automated system dips the parts to be painted in vats of John Deere green or yellow. In short, many welders and painters have been displaced by automation. \n \nThe broader picture tells much the same story. During the Obama years, U.S. manufacturing production increased by more than 20 percent. During the same period, however, manufacturing employment increased by only 5 percent, falling short of the number of manufacturing jobs lost during the 2008 recession. \n \nIn an online article entitled \u201cManufacturing Jobs Are Never Coming Back,\u201d Ben Casselman states, \u201cIn recent years, factories have been coming back, but the jobs haven\u2019t. Because of rising wages in China, the need for shorter supply chains and other factors, a small but growing group of companies are shifting production back to the U.S. But the factories they build here are heavily automated, employing a small fraction of the workers they would have a generation ago.\u201d \n \nPresident Trump has the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in the crosshairs, blaming this 20-year-old treaty for the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs. The extent to which this is the case is a matter of considerable debate. There is no question about a substantial number of U.S. manufacturing jobs being lost. But how much of this is the result of NAFTA and other trade agreements, compared to the impact of automation on employment levels? There is no consensus on this matter. \n \nA NAFTA provision states that a country can withdraw from the agreement six months after giving notice. If President Trump were to take unilateral action of that sort, the result would probably be quite chaotic. Most observers believe that he is not going to do that. Rather, his recent rhetoric suggests that his intent is to renegotiate the agreement with his counterparts in Mexico and Canada. \n \nThat, however, is where matters start getting quite complicated. In his inaugural address, President Trump made very clear his commitment to an \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy. Is there any reason to believe that his counterparts in Mexico and Canada would be willing to make concessions beneficial to the United States without getting something in return? And if not, what concessions would the United States need to make in a renegotiated trade agreement? Moreover, would the end result of a renegotiated agreement, when all is said and done, actually result in more manufacturing jobs in the United States, while diminishing the number of manufacturing jobs in Mexico? It is hard to imagine Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pena Nieto, agreeing to those types of concessions. \n \nThe situation is complicated by the fact that Mexicans are enraged by President Trump\u2019s unilateral decision to construct a new wall between the two countries -- a wall he said during the campaign that Mexico would finance because he would \u201ctell them\u201d to do so. President Pena Nieto has emphatically stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall. \n \nThere are a lot of balls up in the air. How this sorts out remains to be seen. \n  \nDaniel E.

And with our Trans-Tasman rivals back on top of the one-day world rankings, the Chappell-Hadlee Series promises to be a fascinating contest. Here are three key factors for each team. \n \nNew Zealand \n  Blackcaps players celebrate 2016 Chappell-Hadlee series win in New Zealand (Photosport)   \nThe Guptill factor: \n  Martin Guptill celebrates his century in Sydney in December (Photosport)   \nThe Blackcaps need a good start at the top of the order, so the form of Martin Guptill is massively important. He delivered 193 runs in the three-match series last time out against Australia in December, including an outstanding 114 in Sydney. \n \nA blistering 112 from 95 balls in the Ford Trophy this week showed that he's fully recovered from a hamstring injury and would have been manna from heaven for Blackcaps management. It's also worth noting that in the last two NZ v Aus series, five of the six matches have been won by the team batting first. So Kane, win us a toss or two! \n \nBoult from the blue: \n  Blackcaps bowler Trent Boult (Photosport)   \nRemember February 28, 2015? Well, it was a glorious Eden Park afternoon, as Trent Boult produced a spell of bowling that went down in World Cup history. At one stage his figures were 3-2-1-5, with the Aussie middle-order cast asunder. And while Boult has been somewhat inconsistent in recent months, he always raises his game for the green and golds. \n \nHis figures of 3-49 stood out in Melbourne last month, before New Zealand's capitulation and a 117-run defeat. But if Boult doesn't work his magic, then another Blackcap has to step up. You don't beat the best team in the world with run-of-the-mill performances\u2026 who is ready to write their own headlines? \n \nIgnore recent form: \n  Australia celebrates the wicket of Kane Williamson in December 2016 (Photosport)   \nThe last one-day series for the Blackcaps against Australia was a chastening experience. The closest they got to a victory was a 68-run defeat in the first match in Sydney, although at 185-5 chasing 324 we were never really in the hunt. \n \nBut everyone knows the Aussies are flat-track bullies who don't like the pressure! OK, the king of short-form cricket is no longer with us (Brendon McCullum, please come back), but with home advantage and the Kane & Ross show in full effect, the world champions could be in trouble.          \n \nAustralia \n  Australia celebrates Chappell-Hadlee win in December 2016 (Photosport)   \nHow do you replace David Warner? \n  David Warner acknowledges the MCG crowd after scoring a century against New Zealand (Photosport)   \nAustralia is obviously in confident mood, having given Usman Khawaja and the best batsman in the world right now, David Warner, time to prepare for the four-test series in India - so it's likely that Aaron Finch, Shaun Marsh or new boy Travis Head will be facing the new ball. \n \nFinch has only scored 43 runs in his last four ODI outings, while Marsh is another player under pressure, having been in and out of the side. As for Head, he impressed in the series against Pakistan, with 128 his most recent knock. New Zealand will be desperate to make early inroads, so how the opening pair respond could dictate the direction of the series. \n \nThe show must go on\u2026 and on! \n  Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell (Photosport)   \nAny player who calls himself 'The Big Show' obviously doesn't lack confidence\u2026 and while Glenn Maxwell is difficult to like, he's certainly a game-changer in the middle order. A very handy bowler, he's dug himself out of a recent batting trough to score two half-centuries in his last four one-day innings. \n \nAnd with captain Steve Smith also absent due to injury, the microscope will be sharply focused on whether Maxwell can deliver. However, the show hasn't been worth watching against New Zealand - and he's been Trent Boult's bunny. Three dismissals in five innings and a top score of 29 are not impressive numbers. But if he does perform, we'll be sure to hear about it.    \n \nNeed for speed: \n  Mitchell Starc in action (Photosport)   \nConsidered one of the most potent new-ball attacks on the planet, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood can intimidate any batting unit. While Boult is ranked the no 1 ODI bowler by the ICC, many believe Starc is more deserving (he hit top spot in March 2015). \n \nThe quintessential Aussie quick, he's mouthy, swings the ball and has an unplayable yorker. Hazelwood is another player not afraid to express his opinion. Check out this foul-mouthed response when a decision didn't go his way in Wellington last year. \n   \nBut with a 24.27 bowling average in the one-day format and an uncanny knack for bowling the ball outside off stump at great pace, the Aussie fans won't care. If these two bowl well, New Zealand could well struggle.    \n \nNewshuib.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Chappell-Hadlee series: Keys to victory","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Newshub","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"602226314","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"36"},"name":"Newshub","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://feeds.feedburner.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198468504","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That is until I visited Rosati\u2019s in Jefferson Pointe.\n\nWhen I tell you the crispy, thin-crust pizza was the best pizza at this chain best known for its Chicago-style, deep-dish pies, that should tell you a lot. But I have a lot more to tell, including some examples of management ineptitude that had me flummoxed to think of a place with worse service. My thin-crust Godfather pie, which was topped with Italian sausage, fresh garlic, onions and hot giardiniera was quite tasty. The crust crunched like a cracker, the pickled mix of vegetables gave it a punch of flavor and there was plenty of sausage. If you love giardiniera, you will love this pie.\n\nI had half of it without the spicy pickled stuff, and liked it even more as the roasted garlic was more pronounced. I would order this pizza this way every time because it gave me the best of both worlds.\n\nMy thin White Pizza was also good, but it was not supposed to be thin. I asked for it with the double-dough crust \u2013 a slightly thicker crust with a hand-rolled edge. My server admitted her mistake and offered to cut me a break on the bill, but the pizza was so good that I declined.\n\nThis pizza had olive oil instead of red sauce, fresh garlic, sautéed spinach and fresh tomato slices. It was exactly what I expected and though this thin crust was not as crunchy as the Godfather, it was still acceptable.\n\nThe Chicago-style was not acceptable in any way. And I would turn it down if you offered me a slice.\n\nIt had a dreadfully soggy bottom crust \u2013 so soggy the thick layer of cheese actually had more texture. The chunky pomodoro sauce on top was also horribly salty, which added to its awfulness.\n\nThe pizza was served on a dimpled silicone tray that was full of greasy and watery runoff from the poorly reduced sauce, which is probably why that crust was so soggy.\n\nRosati\u2019s does not cook its deep-dish in a deep dish or pan at all, I was told by my server. She said the restaurant uses conveyor ovens instead of high-heat deck ovens. Had I known that before I ordered, I doubt I would have even dared try a Chicago pie there in the first place.\n\nIt is also worth noting that I was warned that I would have to wait about 40 minutes for a Chicago pizza, and it, indeed, took that long. However, I was not warned of a wait when I ordered the thin pies and they, too, took 40 minutes to arrive. \u2022 Dough Nuggets \u2013 I received a huge order of these nicely browned, tender, Parmesan- and herb-dusted beauties that were sitting in a pool of butter. Easily the best appetizer.\n\n\u2022 Chicken wings \u2013 They were pretty big, and the Parmesan-garlic seemed a bit crispier than the standard Buffalo.\n\n\u2022 Turtle Cookie Dough Fudge Brownie \u2013 This dessert had a dense thin brownie topped with a layer of chocolate chip cookie dough with layers of caramel and chopped pecans on top. I would have it again.\n\n\u2022 Side salad \u2013 Dreadfully plain with an iceberg-heavy mix of iceberg and romaine lettuce and few onions and grape tomatoes and shaved Parmesan.\n\n\u2022 Penne and Grilled Chicken a la Vodka \u2013 It had a creamy sauce I liked with a fair amount of tender chicken, but no better than what I could get at a quick-service Italian restaurant for much less money.\n\n\u2022 The Cheef sandwich \u2013 It had a generous amount of tender, juicy, thin-sliced Italian beef, but that beef had no seasoning or flavor. I had it with sweet peppers and giardiniera, and they were the only thing I could taste. The au jus was also flavorless.\n\nThere also was no real atmosphere to speak of at Rosati\u2019s. It is nice inside, but has no character. It has standard wooden walls, a big stainless steel bar, black exposed ceiling and matching tile floor that screams turnkey business, which is what this spot in Jefferson Pointe has become over the years. During one visit, when there were only a few parties in the place and a number of empty tables, I was asked to wait 15 minutes or so while a table was cleared. That special table they cleared for me was next to the kitchen door with all of the noise coming from it. I then asked to be moved and was obliged \u2026 right to one of the tables that was empty as soon as I walked in the door.\n\nDuring another visit on a busy weekend when the place was packed, there was a large booth and a four-top table open when I submitted my name. I was then told I would have to wait about 35 minutes to be seated. I pointed to the empty tables and asked why I could not be seated there. I was told the servers were overwhelmed and could not handle waiting on me.\n\nI requested a manager and asked if my party could at least be seated with the understanding we would face a wait. Again, I was refused. He would rather we stand.\n\nDuring each visit, Rosati\u2019s seemed overwhelmed and the service suffered. My servers made sure to tell me as soon as they came to my table how understaffed they were and how bad a day they were having.\n\nI guess they hadn\u2019t been given a chance to sit down either.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 19 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Polk","zipCode":"50309","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Des Moines","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KCCI","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659157","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1116"},"name":"KCCI","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kcci.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198469481","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The event charged $5 for a wristband that allowed attendees to go to the various booths and a coin that allowed people to vote for their favorite dish. \n \n\"The turnout's been fabulous,\" said Ashlee Champagne with the United Way for South Louisiana. \"We have new sponsors this year, but it's great that the public has really come out today.\" \n \nOver 100 people were milling about the Marriott parking lot, trying out the various samples from the 24 teams that were vying to be this year's supreme soup chef. Along with different soups, drinks and baked goods were for sale, charity raffles were being held, and the band, Pot 2 LA, played an eclectic mix of energetic and fun music. \n \nAt only one hour into the event, some of the competitors had completely run out of samples. Ampol Services had made 10 gallons of its smoked brisket chili and still ran out so fast that the cooks said they didn't even get a chance to eat any of it. \n \n\"We only got to try it when we were cooking it,\" said Barry Champagne. \n \nSome interesting twists on the definition of soup were handed out at the event, too. Along with red bean gumbo and apple pie soup, the soup that won the \"Fan Favorite\" award was Synergy Bank's \"souptini.\" It was a loaded baked potato soup served in a disposable martini glass with a Parmesan crusted pig in a blanket on a toothpick instead of the traditional olive. The team also provided free tropical virgin martinis in an area of tables it set up next to its booth. \n \n\"The marketing department came up with it,\" said Missy Hutchinson with Synergy Bank. \"They're really creative.\" \n \nChristine Martin, who attended with her granddaughter, Brelynn, said she had been coming to the event since the very first SOUPer Bowl and said the crowd was \"fantastic.\" \n \n\"It's at least tripled in size since the first one and it's fabulous,\" Martin said. \"You feel like you're at a fair with all these people.\" \n \nA first for the event was the 5K run that started before the SOUPer Bowl at 9:30 a.m. The race had 50 runners participating and the trophies, which depicted little running chefs in honor of the cook-off, were provided by Grand Isle Shipyard Inc. The winner of the race was Matt Kelso, who said it was more than just a race. \n \n\"It's a great little event for a great cause. It's not about winning a race, it's about helping the community,\" Kelso said. \n \nAs the event began winding down, the coins were counted and the winners were announced. \n \nIn third place was Sonoco with its smoked turkey and green onion sausage gumbo. In second place was Terrebonne General Medical Center with its seafood bisque. And in first place was GSES/Workforce Logistics with its crawfish and smoked corn soup. The team, named Team \"No-Tell,\" was made up of head chef Joey Rogers, Randy Steib, Maria Chaisson and Eddie Doiron. \n \n\"This is our first year participating and only our second year here and it feels great,\" said Steib after his team won. \"We made soup great again.\" \n \nAll proceeds for the event went to the United Way for South Louisiana.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"SOUPer Bowl warms up patrons on a chilly day","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lafourche","zipCode":"70301","state":"Louisiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Thibodaux","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Comet","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668587","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"132"},"name":"Daily Comet","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailycomet.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198469650","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:19:09Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Mehta received his Ph.D. in anthropology with a focus in archaeology from Tulane and has been studying the millennia-old mounds along the Gulf for many years. He said he believes the ancient monuments are at risk. \n \n\u201cLouisiana\u2019s coastal heritage is incredibly threatened from coastal erosion, sea-level rise and human interference,\u201d Mehta said. \u201cIt\u2019s all at risk.\u201d \n \nMehta is studying the mounds along the Louisiana coast with Tulane doctoral candidate Elizabeth Chamberlain and says the mounds are a rarity when considered next to other similar ancient monuments. \n \n\u201cWe have no evidence of the people of coastal Louisiana engaging in any kind of agriculture,\u201d Mehta said. \u201cMore broadly across the world, monument building is tightly tied to agriculture. Only in a few locations like here and coastal Peru do you see monuments without agriculture.\u201d \n \nMehta said these mounds are culturally and historically significant, pointing to the fact that the mound at Poverty Point in north Louisiana is a Unesco World Heritage Site alongside the Great Pyramids of Giza and the Taj Mahal as proof of their importance. \n \nAnd studying these mounds and the movement of the ancient tribes, he has gotten some insight into why the people of Louisiana would abandon one settlement and move to another. \n \n\u201cThere are older settlements to the west and younger settlements to the east,\u201d Mehta said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really understand the mechanism of abandonment and resettlement, but, broadly speaking, the settlements seemed to align with the age of the Delta.\u201d \n \nAccording to Mehta, from 400-1400 A.D., the outflow of the Mississippi River was Bayou Lafourche and it was around this time that the mounds in the region were built. One of the more impressive mounds that Mehta mentioned was the one at Bayou Grand Caillou that is about 26.25 feet high. \n \nThere are also mounds in the Dulac area. Although one that was located near Bayou Hardware has been destroyed, two still exist off Shrimpers Row. \n \n\u201cI think it\u2019s really amazing and beautiful from the top of it,\u201d said Candace Chauvin, a member of the United Houma Nation whose family lives next door to the mound. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising that so many people don\u2019t even know about their history. It\u2019s so important.\u201d \n \nChauvin, who was in attendance for Mehta\u2019s recent presentation on the subject at the Grand Caillou Library, said she wishes more could be done to save them. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019re just disappearing. I really wish there was some way to preserve them,\u201d Chauvin said. \u201cI\u2019m so glad Dr. Mehta did his presentation at the library. People need to know about this stuff.\u201d \n \nMehta is also a humanities teacher at the New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts and a principal at the Gulf Communities Research Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to \u201cpreserving the health, resilience, and lifeways of coastal peoples.\u201d \n \nAccording to Mehta, the current land loss projections are threatening to wash away the mounds outside of levee rings. \n \nHe also says even though places like Dulac and Bayou Grand Caillou are \u201cprotected for some time,\u201d if we don\u2019t fight land loss and reintroduce sedimentation and subsistence, it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely possible we will lose these sites.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe have to do more. We know that historically the Mississippi River would create around half-a-football field of land an hour, yet we\u2019re losing an entire football field an hour now,\u201d Mehta said, quoting recent land loss studies. \u201cIt\u2019s scary that natural systems aren\u2019t able to keep up anymore. We need to do more.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Native American mounds threatened by land loss","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lafourche","zipCode":"70301","state":"Louisiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Thibodaux","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Comet","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668587","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"132"},"name":"Daily Comet","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailycomet.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198469817","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:07:30Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official.

And that peril puts us all \u2014 anyone who lives within tidal surge distance of the Gulf of Mexico \u2014 in peril. \n \nWe have watched for decades as our land washed away into the Gulf. We have also watched the sea level rise and our ground subside beneath us. \n \nFor far too long, our state and federal governments did nothing to offset this unsettling trend. \n \nBut that has begun to change. Chance hasn\u2019t come quickly, but the momentum away from inaction and toward urgent action has at least started. \n \nOur state government has embraced the notion of fighting for the survival of our coast and the betterment of all the people it protects. \n \nA 50-year plan is in place to guide coastal projects toward those that will do the most good with the least money. \n \nThe plan is estimated at $50 billion, and that money has not been secured. But even having a plan is a step forward from where we were just a decade ago. \n \nNow, the plan is in place, and it is reworked and re-evaluated every five years. \n \nRepresentatives from the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority were in Houma Tuesday night to explain the latest version of the Coastal Master Plan and to take comments from the public. \n \nThe meeting was a success. More than 100 people showed up for it, and many were willing to voice their opinions on the plan. \n \nThe fact that so many people have been spurred to action out of concern for our coast shows that there is a growing public awareness of and concern over our plight. \n \nThat in itself is an improvement. \n \nThe next step will be for state officials to finalize the latest iteration of the plan and set about putting it into action. \n \nThat might not seem like a huge goal when the money to fully pay for the plan is still lacking. But the plan is an essential part of our way forward. \n \nAnd there is some money. Much of the money coming in from fines paid by BP for its part in the 2010 oil spill will go toward coastal restoration. The cash won\u2019t pay for all the projects in the plan, but it will create some progress. \n \nThat, too, is important. \n \nThe fact that we have stopped ignoring the problem and started addressing it is a major step in the right direction. The state\u2019s plan represents our best chance at keeping the most of us safe from future storms. \n \nNow, our challenge becomes getting the money to put fully implement the plan. The sooner the work begins, the more good it can do over the long run. \n \nTuesday\u2019s meeting was a great chance for local people to learn more and to get involved. But there are other chances as well. You can learn about the plan and make comments at coastal.la.gov. \n \nTake this opportunity to join the conversation that will help shape our future. \n \nEditorials represent the opinion of the newspaper, not of any individual.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Our opinion: Weighing in on plan for the coast","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lafourche","zipCode":"70301","state":"Louisiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Thibodaux","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Comet","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668587","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"132"},"name":"Daily Comet","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailycomet.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198480161","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n\nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n\nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n\nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n\nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n\n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n\n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n\nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n\n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n\n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n\n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n\n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n\nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n\n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n\n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n\n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4650","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Maryborough","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Fraser Coast Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169674182","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"11"},"name":"Fraser Coast Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.frasercoastchronicle.com.au","publisher":"APN Holdings NZ Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198481069","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557687z1_20170129162619_000g9dg4eu82-0-5o7dbx25uooe6wninn2_ct300x300.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach \n \nSan Francisco : The freshly installed president vowed while campaigning that he would force Apple to bring production to US soil. reuters file photo \nAs US President Donald Trump pushes hard for goods to be \u201cmade in America,\u201d how realistic is it to expect Apple to stop manufacturing its iconic devices in China? \n \nThe freshly installed president vowed while campaigning that he would force Apple to bring production to US soil. \n \nYet, as other big companies have sought to appease the new administration with promises of jobs or investments in the United States, Apple has stayed low-profile. \n \nMajor Apple contractor Foxconn this month confirmed that it is considering a $7 billion investment to make flat panels in the US in a joint project with Japan\u2019s SoftBank. \n \n\u201cI have discussed with my major clients about going to (the US) and they are also willing to invest, including Apple,\u201d Foxconn founder Terry Gou told reporters in Taipei. \nTaiwan-based Foxconn has given no details, and Apple declined to comment. \n \nGlobal Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry believed that moving manufacturing to the US, where many customers are, was more of a commonsense move than a political one. \n \n\u201cYou need to manufacture local products in local markets,\u201d Chowdhry reasoned. \nMaking things locally gives better control of distribution networks and lets manufacturers customize goods for local markets, the analyst noted. \n \nWhether politically motivated or not, Apple is not in the same position as automakers which relocated US factories overseas to cut costs, according to IHS manufacturing processes chief analyst Dan Panzica. Apple never moved jobs offshore, it created them there. \n \n\u201cThe Apple jobs were never here,\u201d Panzica said. \n \n\u201cThe entire supply chain grew in China.\u201d \n \nApple benefits in Asia from a network that goes beyond subcontractors assembling smartphones, tablets or laptops. The California-based firm relies on a dense ecosystem of companies that make components and spare parts for its devices as well. \n \nChina also offers sources of important raw materials, along with cheap, flexible and abundant labor to keep iPhone assembly lines cranking along. \n \nIt would be \u201cvery hard to replicate\u201d that situation with US workers without using \u201cmore robotics and less workforce,\u201d undermining the political aim of creating jobs here, according to Endpoint Technologies analyst Roger Kay. \n \nExacerbating the challenge, \u201cit makes no sense to make phones here if you have to ship all the components from China,\u201d said technology analyst Jack Gold of J.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report. \n \nTM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

A combination of hanging and flat goods and a design concept based on Schaefer\u2019s 3D-MATRIX Solution® facilitates the order processing of both over-the-counter and online trade from one single distribution facility. \n \nThe capacities of four former warehouse locations were consolidated in the new facility at Tuusula. It houses about 100,000 different products \u2013 more than 1.8 million individual items in total. \u201cAll types of articles \u2013 from large products to cosmetics and decorative items to hanging textile goods \u2013 are now bundled together in one location for every distribution channel,\u201d explains Stockmann\u2019s Logistics Manager, Elina Laine. \u201cThe distribution centre is the central component of our omnichannel strategy.\u201d \n \nIn the middle of October, Stockmann held its thirtieth \u201cHullut Päivät\u201d \u2013 literally \u2018Crazy Days\u2019 \u2013 fiveday discount event. In this period, 1.4 million items were sold at the Group\u2019s stores, including the flagship store in Helsinki. With more than 50,000 m² of retail space over eight floors, it is the largest department store in Finland and one of the largest in Europe. \n \nOver one million customers also visited the online shop during this period, with shoppers unpacking their internet orders the very next day. To overcome seasonal peaks like these and to build a firm foundation for further growth and the expansion of the firm\u2019s operations, Stockmann in recent years completely overhauled its corporate logistics and became geared towards omni-channeling. The new operation is based on a system concept with the latest, future-proof automation components, a picking strategy according to the goods-toperson principle and a highperformance warehouse management system that coordinates the completion of orders for the different distribution channels. \u201cAn intelligent material flow concept, innovative system technology and attractive aftersales services for reliably supplying all distribution channels from a single installation,\u201d are how Laine explains the decision to opt for SSI Schaefer. \n \n\u201cSSI Schaefer offered us a thoroughly coherent overall package for long-term efficiency and investment security.\u201d SSI Schaefer developed a solution that organises the complex order handling processes into clear structures. By considering how to make the most efficient use of the 29,000 m² of warehouse space available, the automation components and IT installed guarantee the requisite performance levels. \n \nFurthermore, a five-strong team of technicians \u2013 provided on location and round the clock as part of SSI Resident Maintenance® concept \u2013 ensure for the continual maintenance and constant availability of the installation. \n \nThe centerpiece of the concept is a shuttle system with 130,500 bin storage locations for double-deep storage. The warehouse was designed according to SSI Schaefer\u2019s 3DMATRIX Solution®. Forty-five shuttle lifts and 72 multi-level Navette shuttles guarantee the maximum availability and efficiency of the processes. \u201cWe were already looking for a shuttle solution when we issued the call for tenders,\u201d adds Logistics Manager, Laine. \u201cThe modular and scalable solution concept from SSI Schaefer impressed us immediately, as it provides our business with that all-important flexibility.\u201d Furthermore, a pallet rack warehouse with 7,800 storage locations to replenish picking locations and a three-level hanging goods warehouse for more than 350,000 garments characterise the installation\u2019s design. \n \n\u201cThe material flows for store and eCommerce orders had been consistently separated due to the different shipment packaging and transport service providers,\u201d says Rami Syrjä, Sales Manager for SSI Schaefer in Finland. \u201cCoordinating this, structuring it according to staging times and different priorities and maintaining this all in perfect balance across a single installation presents a considerable challenge for the design of the warehouse management system.\u201d Stockmann opted for SSI Schaefer\u2019s WAMAS® logistics software.

She also said the \"Blurred Lines'' singer has traumatized her and her son by demanding visitation and refusing to leave her mother's home last week. \n \nThicke's attorney Larry Ginsberg wrote in a court filing opposing the restraining order that there was no basis to issue it and called it a retaliatory move by Patton after she was denied sole custody earlier this month. Emails to Ginsberg and Thicke's publicist were not returned Thursday afternoon. \n \nPatton's sworn declaration includes several allegations that Thicke was abusive during their marriage and pushed her to the ground and kicked her during a fight in April 2013. She also accused him of numerous infidelities during their marriage and having a substance abuse problem. Her attorneys cited a California law that Thicke's behaviour during their marriage made Patton currently feel a \"reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to herself and the child.'' \n \n\n \nRobin Thicke and Paula Patton arrive at the Grammy Awards in 2014 in Los Angeles. \n \nHer filing states that Thicke showed up at her mother's house on January 19 while their son was being interviewed by child services workers and that the singer refused to leave. After the child services workers left, Thicke banged on the door and demanded to see his son, leaving only after Patton's mother called police, Patton wrote. \n \n\"This last incident with Robin was terrifying for me,'' Patton wrote. \"It was terrifying for our son.'' \n \nGinsberg wrote in a court filing that Thicke is seeking sole custody and accuses Patton of manipulating their son. \n  \n\"It was terrifying for our son.'' \n  \nThe couple has been embroiled in a custody dispute for weeks, and Thicke's paperwork notes that Patton had recently sought a change in custody arrangements unsuccessfully. \"She is trying to take a second bite at the apple,'' Ginsberg wrote. \n \nLeis' order, which will remain in effect until a Feb. 24 hearing, includes a finding that Thicke has a history of domestic violence and is a risk to flee with his son. The order restricts Thicke's ability to travel outside Los Angeles County with his son. \n \nSchool asked child welfare to investigate \n \nThe custody battle erupted earlier this month, after child services investigators began looking into allegations that Thicke had physically abused his son. Thicke acknowledged that he spanked his son, which his attorney noted is allowed under the law, but denied the singer was abusive. Patton's petition was supported by declarations from her son's school, who asked child welfare workers to investigate. \n \nThicke's attorney has said in court filings that investigators cleared the singer of any wrongdoing. \n \nIt also comes just weeks after the death of Thicke's father, \"Growing Pains'' actor Alan Thicke. \n \nThicke, whose biggest hit was the 2013 song \"Blurred Lines,'' and Patton dated for 10 years before marrying in June 2005. She filed for divorce in October 2014, and their judgment was finalized a few months later. \n Suggest a correction","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sthembile Gasa"},"topics":[],"title":"Robin Thicke Ordered To Stay Away From Ex-Wife","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"HuffingtonPost.co.za","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"610756893","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"HuffingtonPost.co.za","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198505034","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

During Saban\u2019s 10-year tenure at Alabama, 55 Crimson Tide players have been selected in the NFL draft. (Photo: USA TODAY Sports) \n  \nMOBILE \u2014 Having cut his coaching teeth working under Jerry Glanville and Bill Belichick, in addition to his two years as head coach of the Miami Dolphins before coming to Alabama, Nick Saban has quite the reputation around the NFL. \n \nAnd for the most past, it\u2019s a pretty good one, especially among the coaching ranks. \n \n\u201cI saw Nick today, he and I go way back \u2014 he was the DB coach at the Houston Oilers when I was the DB coach at Pitt,\u201d Chicago Bears head coach John Fox said Tuesday following his first practice coaching the North team during Senior Bowl week. \n \n\u201cSo we kind of came up through the college ranks about the same time, sprung into pro football about the same time, and obviously he\u2019s gone back to college as a head coach in a couple of different settings, and had a lot of success.\u201d \n \nThat success, especially at Alabama, is well documented \u2014 four of his five national championships and five SEC titles since 2008 \u2014 and it carries weight around NFL circles. \n \nOf course, much of that perception stems from how Saban has used an NFL model \u2014 from the front office to what appears on the field \u2014 to build the Crimson Tide into a perennial national power. \n \n\u201cA lot of it is what they\u2019ve been exposed to, scheme-wise,\u201d Fox said. \u201cI think primarily up to this point (Alabama has) been a pro-style offense and defense, and I think that helps guys transition to the National Football League.\u201d \n \nThat has shown in the sheer numbers of former Saban products going into the NFL. \n \nSince not having a single player taken in the 2008 draft, following his first season at the helm, Alabama has had 55 players drafted, including an NCAA-best 18 in the first round. This past season, 42 former Alabama players were on NFL rosters \u2014 though not all played under Saban. \n \nOf them, Saban and Alabama had a league-high six former players named to the Pro Bowl \u2014 Oakland\u2019s Amari Cooper, New England\u2019s Dont\u2019a Hightower, Baltimore\u2019s C.J. Mosley, Atlanta\u2019s Julio Jones, Green Bay\u2019s Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, and New York Giants\u2019 Landon Collins. Since 2012, 10 different Tide players have been named All-Pros a total of 16 times. \n \nThose figures could continue to rise, especially if projections hold true and the Crimson Tide has between five to seven players selected among the first 32 picks in April\u2019s upcoming NFL draft. \n \n\u201cWhenever you\u2019re dealing with human talent, it\u2019s not automatic,\u201d Fox said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve obviously had a lot of guys in the league that have performed well, so we consider that.\u201d \n \nSaban often uses that strong connection to the NFL as a recruiting tool, pointing to the dozens of former players he\u2019s sent to play at the next level in his four decades as a college coach. It\u2019s one of the many reasons Alabama is potentially closing in on its seventh consecutive No. 1 recruiting class in the country. \n \n\u201cYou know that if they\u2019re competing for national championships every year, competing for the playoffs, that means they\u2019re stacking their roster with good talent,\u201d said Marc Lillibridge, the director of Elite Performance who has 20-plus years of experience as an NFL agent and scout with the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City Chiefs. \n \n\u201cA lot of (NFL scouts) know that \u2026 because everybody knows Nick Saban can recruit. So you\u2019re going to go into that school and find those guys.\u201d \n \nBut how NFL personnel view Crimson Tide players goes beyond the number of stars they had coming out of high school. \n \nLeague personnel value several intangible qualities that players tend to have after working under Saban, including a relentless work ethic and never-satisfied approach to the game that tend to be staples of Saban\u2019s \u201cProcess.\u201d \n \n\u201cTeams know that they\u2019re getting a player that played at a program that demanded effort, demanded that trademark toughness,\u201d CBSSports.com senior NFL draft analyst Dane Brugler said. \u201cThey\u2019re not all going to be Ryan Andersons or O.J. Howards \u2014 there will be some misses \u2014 but you know first and foremost he\u2019s going to bring talent to Tuscaloosa, and then he\u2019s going to develop them.\u201d \n \nOf course, while Saban\u2019s name alone won\u2019t help improve a player\u2019s draft stock, the knowledge of the sort of training those players have been subjected to under Saban certainly has an effect on how scouts and NFL executives evaluate Alabama players. \n \n\u201cObviously you know what type of instruction these players are getting (at Alabama), you know the program that they have,\u201d Brugler said. \u201cSo you\u2019re not going to move a player up just based on where he comes from \u2014 you try to look at all these players without a logo on the helmet \u2014 you\u2019re looking at just the individual player. But it\u2019s impossible not (to take that into consideration). \n \n\u201cAnd if Nick Saban has a lot of nice things to say about Ryan Anderson, you don\u2019t dismiss that.

New Orleans\u2019 point total was also a season high for a Spurs opponent. \n \nDallas, which has lost its first two games against San Antonio this season, is coming off a 109-98 road defeat to Oklahoma City on Thursday. Russell Westbrook scored 17 of his 45 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Thunder. The Spurs face Westbrook, the NBA\u2019s leading scorer, for the first time this season Tuesday night.

Leonard had scored at least 30 points in six consecutive games before being sidelined. \n \nTony Parker also returned to the floor after missing four consecutive games with pain in his left foot, but he made only 2 of 7 shots and finished with seven points and just three assists. \n \nLaMarcus Aldridge finished with 14 points and 14 rebounds, his ninth double-double of the season, and rookie Davis Bertans led the bench with 17 points. Bertans hit 6 of 9 shots, including a career-high 5 of 7 from beyond the arc. Bertans is only the second rookie in Spurs history to make at least five 3-pointers in game. Gary Neal holds the record with six in 2011. \n \nDavid Lee, who has started four of the last five games for injured center Pau Gasol, finished with 13 points on 5-of-7 shooting and added 10 rebounds. \n \nThe Spurs trailed by only one (85-84) going into the fourth quarter, but Jones (11), Tyreke Evans (9) and Hill (7) combined for 27 points to keep the Pelicans ahead. \n \nAlthough the Silver and Black scored more than 100 points for the 23rd consecutive game, they shot only 38.8 percent overall (33/85). They were 42.9 percent (12/28) from beyond the arc. The Spurs\u2019 23-game streak of scoring 100-plus points has matched the longest in franchise history since the 1987-88 team eclipsed the century mark for 29 straight. \n \nDallas had won five of its previous seven games before falling to OKC on Thursday night. Harrison Barnes led Dallas with 31 points and Justin Anderson had 17.

He's one of the staff members, part of an increasingly grey workforce in an increasingly grey country. \n \n\"I enjoy talking to the people here. It's fun, but it's also hard work,\" Odaira said during a break from his caregiving duties on a recent day. \n \nJapan is considered a \"super-aging\" society. More than a quarter of the population is over 65, a figure set to rise to 40 percent by 2050. The average life expectancy is 85, and that means many Japanese remain relatively healthy for a good two decades after retirement age. \n \nAt the same time, the birthrate has plummeted to well below the level needed to keep the population stable. Now home to 128 million people, Japan is expected to number less than 100 million by 2050, according to government projections. \n \nThat means authorities need to think about ways to keep seniors healthy and active for longer, but also about how to augment the workforce to cope with labour shortages. \n \nEnter the septuagenarian caregiver. \n \nAt Cross Heart, more than half of the 119 caregivers are over 60, and 15 of them are over 70. \n \n\"When we advertise for people to work here, we get lots of responses from older people, not younger people,\" said nursing home director Kaori Yokoo in the lobby where residents were doing leg curls and chest presses on weight machines. \n \nThe foundation that runs this nursing home and others in Kanagawa Prefecture has raised the official retirement age to 70 but allows employees to keep working until 80 if they want to and can. Municipalities around the country are also actively recruiting people over 60 to do lighter duties at nursing homes. \n \nIt's one way of dealing with the problem. Meanwhile, researchers are working on robots that can lift the elderly out of beds and wheelchairs, and inward-looking Japan is slowly coming around to the idea that it may need to allow in more foreign workers. \n \nAlthough older workers have constraints - some can't do the heavier tasks - they also offer advantages over younger workers who want time off for their children, said Yokoo, who is 41. \n \n\"Plus, because they're close in age to the residents, they can relate to each other more,\" she said. \"We younger people think this must be nice for them. Older staff can understand things like physical pains more because they are living through the same things.\" \n \nSome of the older workers here are doing it because they need the money. For others, the money is a nice benefit, but the main motivation is the activity and sense of community. \n \nKiyoko Tsuboi, a 95-year-old who comes into the rest home during the day, said she likes having Odaira around. \n \n\"He's very attentive to our needs and knows things like how hot we like our tea. My son is not as kind as Odaira-san,\" Tsuboi said as Odaira cleared away the lunch dishes. \"He's quite active despite his age, and even though he's a man, he has an eye for detail.\" \n \nThe dynamic works well for Odaira, too, who started here 17 years ago after retiring from his job in the sales department of an auto parts maker. He works eight hours a day, four days a week. \n \nHis father died when he was small, his mother when he was 22. \"It's not like I'm replacing my mother, but I thought I could help someone else's parents,\" he said. \n \nHe also does it to stay young, Odaira said with a twinkle in his eye. \"I think it's good for me physically and mentally, so as long as I can keep working, I will.\" \n \nHe's not the oldest worker here, though. That title is shared by two 78-year-olds, a man who works in the office, and Noriko Fukuju, who helps with pickups and drop-offs and does activities with \"the old people.\" \n \n\"It's fun. I enjoy it,\" she said. \n \nHiroko Akiyama, at the University of Tokyo's Institute of Gerontology, said a Japanese 65-year-old is in much better physical and mental shape than a 65-year-old a few decades ago. \"They are full of energy, and healthy and long-living,\" she said. \n \nAkiyama's research has found that working helps keep seniors that way. \"They operate on a regular schedule. They wake up, get ready, go to work and talk to people and stay connected,\" she said. \"We had a depressed old woman who changed completely after she started working.\" \n \nStill, Japan can't rely solely on seniors or, potentially, robots to staff its nursing homes, where the need will only grow as the population ages, analysts say. \n \nJapan has agreements with Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines under which applicants who complete job training and pass a Japanese language test can work at a Japanese nursing home. \n \nBut if they want to stay beyond three years, they must pass a national caregiver's exam so difficult that 40 percent of Japanese applicants fail. Many Japanese also express concern about cultural differences. \n \nNext year, the Japanese government will loosen the regulations slightly and set up a technical intern program, but there will still be time limits and difficult tests to pass. \n \nPerhaps 2,000 people will come to Japan through the intern program, said Yasuhiro Yuki, an expert on elderly care at Shukutoku University. \"But we hear we will need 300,000 more caregivers in the next 10 years,\" he said. \"So I still don't think we will have enough.\" \n \nThat means aging caregivers will increasingly become the norm. \n \n\"I can do this at least for two more years,\" said Fukuju, the 78-year-old, before she dashed out the door to renew her driver's licence.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ANNA FIFIELD"},"topics":[{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Staff in rest homes as grey as the residents","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southland Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169697795","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Southland Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198517087","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro. \n \nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016. \n \nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said. \n \nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago. \n \n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\" \n \nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch. \n \nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun. \n \nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington. \n \nThe story Werriwa Wiener dash claims world dachsund record first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Werriwa Wiener dash claims world dachsund record","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Blacktown Sun","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169699273","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Blacktown Sun","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.blacktownsun.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198536898","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The weeks-long conflict had become one of the biggest internal challenges yet to Francis' efforts to modernize the 1.2 billion member Roman Catholic Church. \n \nAt issue was the Order's reaction to the discovery that condoms had been distributed by one of its aid projects in Myanmar. The Order had fired its Grand Chancellor, Albrecht Freiherr von Boeselager, whom it held responsible for the condom distribution. Von Boeselager declined to comment for this article. \n  \n  \nThough condom use goes against Catholic teaching, the Vatican had ordered an investigation into the firing of von Boeselager. It subsequently publicly castigated Festing, who had refused to cooperate with the investigation. \n \nBacking down, Festing -- a former Sotheby's art auctioneer -- gave a hand-written resignation letter to Francis in the pope's private residence, according to a senior Vatican source. Festing, who has the title of prince, declined an interview request. \n \nInstead of quelling the conflict, however, Festing's resignation was followed by yet another challenge to Francis' authority -- led by vocal pope critic American Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, according to Vatican and Knights sources. \n \nIn particular: Burke tried to convince Festing to withdraw his resignation and keep fighting the pope, these sources say. On Saturday, the Knight's Sovereign Council accepted Festing's resignation and re-instated von Boselager, a clear defeat for Burke. \n \nBurke declined to comment for this article. \n \nThe tussle suggested Francis is still battling to consolidate his power over the Church almost four years into his tenure, Vatican insiders say. \n \nBeyond a fight over condoms, the clash pointed to lingering divisions between the Church's conservatives and more progressive factions who support the pope's reformist agenda, they add. \n \nFrancis is trying to make the Church less dogmatic and more welcoming to whose who have felt excluded, such as homosexuals and the divorced. \n \n\"While this whole saga was an internal matter that probably should have stayed that way, it metamorphosed into a clash that showed the divide between conservatives and progressives,\" said Andrea Tornielli, author of several books on Pope Francis. \n \nThe Vatican declined to comment on the clash and on Pope Francis' efforts to consolidate his power. \n \nIt directed Reuters to two public statements. One, on Dec. 22, relates to the Vatican order to investigate the firing of von Boeselager. The second, on Jan. 17, followed a pledge by Festing on the Knights' web page not to cooperate with the Vatican. It decried his resistance and ordered members of the order to cooperate. \n \nA German aristocrat whose father participated in a failed plot to kill Hitler in World War Two, von Boeselager was fired by Festing in December, and accused of having allowed the use of condoms while he was head of the Knights' global humanitarian projects. \n \nFesting fired him in Burke's presence, arguing that the German had hidden the condom use from the order's leaders when he was named Grand Chancellor, according to Knights and Vatican sources. \n \nImmediately, the firing set off the conflict between the Knights' hierarchy and the Vatican. \n \nVon Boeselager , a devout Catholic, said in a statement on Dec. 23 that he was fully behind Church teachings. He closed two projects in the developing world when he discovered condoms were being distributed but kept a third running in Myanmar for a while because closing it would have abruptly ended all basic medical services to poor people. \n \nThe Church does not allow condoms as a means of birth control and says abstinence and monogamy in heterosexual marriage is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. \n \nIn the same statement, von Boeselager said Festing and Burke told him the Vatican wanted him to resign and that there would be \"severe consequences\" for the Order if he did not. \n \nThe Vatican denied, in a letter from its secretary of state to the Order and seen by Reuters, that it had mandated the resignation, saying it had told the Knights the pope wanted a solution through dialogue. \n \nThe German said his sacking was against the Knights' constitution and appealed to the pope, who ordered the investigation. \n \nFesting refused to cooperate, issuing a series of increasingly strident public statements. In one, he called the papal commission that was investigating the firing \"legally irrelevant\". \n \nIn a Jan. 14 confidential letter to the top echelons of the order and seen by Reuters, Festing wrote: \"In refusing to acknowledge this group of people's jurisdiction, I am trying to protect the order's sovereignty\". \n \nThe institution has the status of a sovereign entity, maintaining diplomatic relations with over 100 states and the European Union and permanent observer status at the United Nations. \n \nThe pope was irritated by Festing's defiant stand, a senior Vatican source said, and the Vatican shot back with a public statement ordering the Knights to obey. \n \nAfter that public order, Festing changed his tune and resigned in the pope's residence a week later. \n \nFesting's resignation came as a shock for many inside the Knights: some of them told Reuters it was akin to the resignation of Pope Benedict in 2013. \n \nFour sources said that for many others in the order, it came as a relief. They feared the clash was damaging the image of the institution whose 13,000 members, 80,000 volunteers and 20,000 paid medical staff help the neediest around the world. \n \nThe day after Festing handed his resignation to the pope, Cardinal Burke drove to the order's headquarters from his apartment near the Vatican and sought to persuade Festing to withdraw his resignation, a source from the Vatican and one from the Knights said. \n \nBurke declined to comment on his meeting with Festing. \n \nBurke has long been leading challenges against the pope. Pope Francis demoted him from a top Vatican job in 2014 with no official explanation and assigned him to be the \"patron\" of the Order of Malta. \n \nSuch \"patron\" positions are usually given to older cardinals after they retire at 75. Burke was only 66 then and the demotion was widely seen as a sign of the pope's irritation with the cardinal's constant sniping over Francis' reforms. \n \nIn particular, Burke has contested moves by the pope that would allow Catholics who have divorced and re-married outside the Church without an annulment to return to the sacrament of communion. Burke declined to comment on his demotion. \n \nSince the demotion, Burke has become even more of a rallying point for conservatives, flying around the world to give lectures to conservative groups and often giving interviews criticizing the pope's decisions. \n \nIn November, he led a rare public challenge to the pope with three other cardinals who accused the pontiff of sowing confusion on important moral issues such as that of communion for the divorced. \n \nBurke later said in an interview that if the pope did not respond to their letter, the cardinals might need to \"correct\" the pope themselves for the good of the Church. \n \nThe Vatican did not comment on the uprising at the time but many of the pope's supporters publicly criticized the four cardinals. \n \nThe pope will now appoint a \"pontifical delegate\" to help run the order, at least until elections can be held for a new Grand Master. \n \nIn a personal letter to the Sovereign Council on Jan. 27 and seen by Reuters, Francis made clear that the Vatican did not want to interfere with the Order's sovereignty but said his delegate would seek to \"renew the spirituality of the Order, specifically of those members who take vows.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Malta news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"The Pope And The Knights Of Malta: High Profile Catholic Feud Explained","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Christian Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672328","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"123"},"name":"Christian Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Religion"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.christiantoday.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://videojs.com/html5-video-support/"],"sequenceId":"695198543798","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:35:02Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued for a temporary stay that allowed detained travelers to stay in the United States. \n \nSupporters outside the Brooklyn courtroom and at protests at airports in Dallas, Chicago, New York and elsewhere cheered the decision, but a bigger fight lay ahead. \n  \n  \nThe court action does not reverse Trump's order, which was criticized by some of America's closest allies. \n \nTrump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. \n \nHe told reporters in the White House's Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \"not a Muslim ban\" and said the measures were long overdue. \n \n\"It's working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\" Trump said. \n \nAlong with Syria, the ban affects travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n \nThe Department of Homeland Security said about 375 travelers had been affected by the order, 109 of whom were in transit and were denied entry to the United States. Another 173 were stopped by airlines before boarding. \n \nThe new rules blindsided people in transit and families waiting for them, and caused havoc for businesses with employees holding passports from the targeted nations and colleges with international students. \n \nPegah Rahmani, 25, waited at Washington's Dulles airport for several hours for her grandparents, both Iranian citizens with U.S. green cards. \"They weren't treating them very well,\" she said. \n \nRahmani's grandfather is 88 and legally blind. Her grandmother is 83 and recently had a stroke. They were released to loud cheers and cries. \n \nSeveral Democratic governors said they were examining whether they could launch legal challenges, and other groups eyed a constitutional challenge claiming religious discrimination. \n \n\"I don't think anyone is going to take this lying down,\" said Cleveland immigration lawyer David Leopold. \"This is the tip of the spear and more litigation is coming.\" \n \nThe White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Senior officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security told reporters the government would implement any appropriate orders. \n \nHowever, Mark Krikorian, the director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, called such lawsuits \"last ditch efforts\" that would only apply to a few individuals, and he said a broader constitutional argument would be hard to win. \n \n\"The first amendment doesn't apply to foreigners living abroad. The law explicitly says the president can exclude any person or class of people he wants,\" Krikorian said. \n \nSome leaders from the U.S. technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, issued warnings to their staff and called the order immoral and un-American. \n \n\"This ban will impact many innocent people,\" said Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc UBER.UL, who said he would raise the issue at a White House meeting on Friday. \n \nArab travelers in the Middle East and North Africa said the order was humiliating and discriminatory. Iran vowed to retaliate. \n \nSudan called the action \"very unfortunate\" after Washington lifted sanctions on the country just weeks ago for cooperation on combating terrorism. A Yemeni official expressed dismay at the ban. \n \nIraq's former ambassador to the United States, Lukman Faily, told Reuters that Trump's ban was unfair to a country that itself has been a victim of terror attacks, and could backfire. \n \n\"We have a strong partnership with U.S., more so in the urgent fight against terrorism. This ban move will not help, and people will start questioning the bond of this partnership, Faily said. \n \nAllies in the United Kingdom, France and Germany were critical. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted a photo of himself welcoming Syrian refugees. \n \nConfusion abounded at airports as immigration and customs officials struggled to interpret the new rules. Some legal residents with green cards who were in the air when the order was issued were detained at airports upon arrival. \n \nHowever, senior administration officials said it would have been \"reckless\" to broadcast details of the order in advance. \n \nOther officials said green card holders from the affected countries would require extra screening and would be cleared on a case-by-case basis. \n \nAirlines were blindsided and some cabin crew were barred from entering the country. \n \nTravelers were handled differently at different points of entry and immigration lawyers advised clients to change their destination to the more lenient airports, said Houston immigration lawyer Mana Yegani. \n \nAt Chicago O'Hare International Airport, brothers Bardia and Ayden Noohi waited for four hours for their father Kasra Noohi - who has an Iranian passport and a U.S. green card - to be allowed through. \n \nThey knew Trump had pledged tougher rules but did not expect the problems. \"I didn't think he'd actually do it,\" Bardia Noohi, 32, said. \"A lot of politicians just talk.\" \n \nThousands of refugees seeking entry were thrown into limbo. Melanie Nezer of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society said she knew of roughly 2,000 who were booked to come to the United States next week. \n \nTrump's order indefinitely bans refugees from Syria. In a television interview, he said he would seek to prioritize Christian refugees fleeing the war-torn country. \n \nU.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were not consulted on the action and in some cases only learned the details as they were made public. \n \nAt the State Department, a senior official said lawyers were working to interpret the executive order, which allows entry to people affected by the order when it is in the \"national interest.\" \n \nHowever, a federal law enforcement official said: \"It's unclear at this point what the threshold of national interest is.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Chaos And Anger As Trump Ban For Muslim Countries Begins","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Christian Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672328","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"123"},"name":"Christian Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Religion"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.christiantoday.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://videojs.com/html5-video-support/"],"sequenceId":"695198546496","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The much followed price index gained 16 percent while the weighted index gained by 11 percent as compared to 1.4 percent for MSCI GCC index and a negative 2.7 percent for Saudi Arabia. This has been among one of the sharpest rallies for Kuwait main index in recent years as the index posted positive gains for the fourteenth consecutive day. The surge in index is also matched by surge in liquidity. \n \nWhile in the short run, a quick run up in the market is difficult to explain, in the long run stock market rally can only be sustained if there is concomitant increase in earnings. In the absence of healthy earnings growth, such sudden rise in market valuation will only feed speculators and invite fringe traders who will cause more harm than good for retail investors. It is clear that Kuwait and other GCC markets badly need active participation and support of institutional investors (SWF\u2019s, mutual funds, etc) in order to avoid hyper speculation. Regulators should engage with such institutional investors more actively in order to broad base their participation and encourage investment companies that manage funds and portfolios for such institutional investors. They will not only professionalize the market but can bring the much-needed stability in market activity, which will ultimately reduce volatility of the market. \n \nThere is a need to better align the institutional money in the market, best represented by mutual funds and portfolios managed by CMA licensed non-banking financial institutions. It is clear that KIA has shown a stable commitment to support the KSE since 1990\u2019s when it launched and backed the mutual fund industry and continue to back it since then in many ways including governance. In addition to KIA, the CMA licensed companies manage portfolios and funds that best incarnate the values of CMA best represented by transparent, well governed, and research driven investment, and exceptional records in anti-money laundering (AML). Yet regulation, reaching the right balance between regulations and restoring market confidence through a spirit of partnership seems to be the missing variable, especially to those investment companies that managed to survive the crisis and grow. Such CMA licensed financial sector companies are the natural gates towards institutional investment to avoid any unwarranted euphoria or speculation. \n \nAt the beginning of 2016, we were positive on UAE while being neutral on Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar. UAE (especially Dubai) was the outperformer in GCC markets, which was in-line with our expectations. Saudi Arabia stock market also returned positive helped by the recovery in oil prices towards the end of the year. Kuwait and Qatar ended the year flat. The overall S&P GCC index returned 9.5 percent in 2016 with better performance coming in the second part of the year. Despite over 50 percent rise in oil prices, investors seemed to take a wait and watch position before investing in the stock markets. This could be on account of poor corporate earnings growth and lower capital expenditures by GCC governments. \n \nEconomy \n \nQatar is expected to have the highest non-oil GDP growth rate (5.2 percent for 2017) in the region on account of the spending on infrastructure projects. In the recent budget, $25bn or 47 percent of the budget is earmarked for the completion of projects related to FIFA 2022. As of November 2016, Kuwait has awarded close to $12bn worth of contracts. Close to 58 percent of the projects awarded has been from the non-oil sector. Kuwait is in a favourable position when it comes to fiscal and current accounts. Overall we are Neutral on Kuwait, UAE & Qatar while Negative on the rest of the GCC on economic factors. \n \nEarnings \n \nGrowth in the overall earnings for GCC countries is expected to be flat at 0.3 percent for 2017 as GCC governments cut down on budget and welfare spending. Economic heavyweights of the region \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar saw their corporate earnings decline by 3.6 percent, 3.4 percent and 7.8 percent respectively while that of UAE remained flat during 2016. Oman\u2019s earnings witnessed a turnaround in 2016 and grew by 5.5 percent. 2017 could perhaps be seen as a year of consolidation and GCC corporates adjusting themselves to the new normal. \n \nValuation \n \nStock market returns for the GCC region, in 2016, with the exception of the UAE were either flat or marginally negative. As a result of this, the stock valuation levels have drifted away from the fundamental values. For instance, Price-to-earnings multiple for Saudi Arabia currently stands at 17.5x followed by Kuwait at 17.1x, and, in comparison with other major GCC markets such as UAE (P/E 12.2x) and Qatar (P/E 13.5x) they are trading at a premium. As a result, we are negative on Saudi stock market from a valuation standpoint while we remain neutral on Kuwait, UAE and Qatar. We are positive on Oman and Bahrain on account of higher dividend yields of 5 percent and 6 percent respectively. \n \nMarket Liquidity \n \nGCC stock markets have had some of the lowest levels of turnover in 2016 clocking in a turnover ratio at 34 percent despite the emerging market status of Qatar and UAE. Even the recovery in oil price during the 2nd quarter failed to increase the interest of investors in the region. Poor earnings growth in many of the key sectors, especially banks, did not augur well for improving the liquidity in the stock markets. We are Neutral on Saudi & UAE while Negative on the rest from liquidity point of view. \n \nOverall Ratings \n \nSaudi Arabia \u2014 Neutral \n \nSaudi Arabia is entering an interesting phase now. It is undertaking a number of reforms, which are aimed at reducing the fiscal burden and increasing the employment opportunities for its youngsters. These reforms could cause some slowdown in the economy as the citizens adjust themselves to a new normal. Insurance sector continues to grow in the country despite the slowdown and is expected to continue in 2017 while construction related companies could suffer as government increases scrutiny on projects. Consumption could take a hit as a result of reform measures, which is why we have given a neutral rating for Saudi Arabia. \n \nUAE \u2014 Neutral \n \nDubai is looking to continue its spending on account of the Expo 2020 as most of the infrastructure projects enter the final phase of the building process by early 2018. Areas like tourism, finance, hospitality, trade should continue to grow in 2017. Abu Dhabi, on the other hand, has been prudent even during boom times and has comfortable reserves to tide through 2017. Despite this, the global market for oil is expected to remain subdued. Real estate, one of the main drivers of UAE\u2019s growth could take a hit in 2017 as sales are stagnating. As a result, we expect UAE to be neutral in 2017. \n \nQatar \u2014 Negative \n \nQatar is an interesting case. On the one hand, the government is spending on account of the 2022 FIFA world cup and targets a budget breakeven while on the other hand the financial sector of the country has suffered the most owing to government drawdowns. Telecom sector has been performing well in Qatar and is expected to continue it in 2017. Banking could take a hit as lower deposits could hamper credit growth. Valuations have not gone down in line with fundamentals, which is why we are negative on the Qatari market. \n \nKuwait \u2014 Neutral \n \nKuwait has seen lot of positive signals going for it during 2017. Its project awards market is witnessing a turnaround as a number of projects were awarded in 2016. The project awards trajectory has been quite positive. Banks in the region are better placed compared to its GCC peers and are likely to perform well in 2017 while real estate could suffer negatively owing to stagnant sales, price declines and negative sentiment. The market is fairly attractive and there are some capital market reforms that are on cards that is expected to augur well for the market. \n \nGCC Debt Market Outlook 2017 \n \nThe prolonged period of low oil prices has put a strain on government budgets across the region, exposing the dependence that GCC economies have on oil revenues. Saudi Arabia, Oman and Bahrain have all scrambled to raise funds through bond issuances to compensate for the fall in oil revenues. Their sovereign rating was also downgraded in 2016 on back of widening fiscal balance and sluggish economic growth. However, Saudi Arabia with its \u201cA1\u201d rating remains in the investment grade while Oman (BBB-) and Bahrain (BB \u2014 Junk) have lower ratings. The ratings downgrade has had a visible impact on the pricing of the bonds. KSA had to pay 185 bps over the 10 yr US treasury bond while Oman had to pay 320 bps over the 10 yr treasury bond. GCC governments should carefully consider their borrowing and investment decisions while maintaining significant liquidity buffers for protecting themselves against short-term funding risk. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and UAE have significant headroom for borrowing as they have very little public debt outstanding. There is room for taking on more debt; however, it should be done only after careful considerations of the implications of building up debt and the impact of borrowing on domestic liquidity, credit, and central bank reserves. We expect GCC governments to cumulatively issue over $74 billion of debt in 2017. \n \narabtimesonline","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"United Arab Emirates news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Saudi Arabia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Kuwait news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Qatar news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Oman news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Bahrain news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Outlook \u2018neutral\u2019 despite Kuwait\u2019s bull run","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"KW","country":"Kuwait"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Q8DailyNews","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"564524374","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Q8DailyNews","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://q8dailynews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198547193","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Without funds for an attorney, I accepted deferred probation. It has followed me my entire life. \n \nI graduated from college, law, and graduate school, yet I had to endure a hearing to ascertain my fitness to practice. It also caused employment rejection. \n \nLater, as assistant county attorney in El Paso, and elected district attorney in Willacy County, I routinely dismissed pot cases. Prosecutor\u2019s offices have limited budgets, yet mountains of cases. Dismissing marijuana offenses, allowed me to send more dangerous criminals to prison. \n \nEven probation for pot was wasteful. Curfews and reporting requirements should be for prowlers and burglars, not pot smokers. \n \nThis problem persists, as 620,000 Americans were arrested for pot last year. Yes, illegal marijuana creates jobs for probation officers, prosecutors, bailiffs, chemists, clerical staff and many more; however taxpayers get soaked. \n \nCalifornia and three other states legalized marijuana on Nov. 8. Voters were persuaded by the Colorado experience, where $2.4 billion in revenues and 17,000 jobs were created in legalization\u2019s first year. Some of this boom comes from visiting Texans. \n \nThe Denver Post polled, \u201cWould you repeal legalization?\u201d The answer; \u201cNo\u201d, by a 51 percent to 36 percent margin. Gallup\u2019s 2016 poll showed support for legalization has grown to 60 percent nationally, and recent studies demonstrate no increased use among youngsters since legalization. Colorado is booming, and other states want what they\u2019re smoking. \n \nThe old \u201cReefer Madness\u201d arguments against marijuana have been dispelled. Today\u2019s legalization opponents such as Insys Therapeutics, which develops synthetic painkillers, poured $500,000 into the \u201cNo\u201d vote in Arizona. It\u2019s these legal painkillers which cause so much addiction and harm. \n \nPrescription drugs increase our health costs and Big Pharma doesn\u2019t want competition. The Catholic Church was also a huge contributor, with the Boston Archdiocese donating $850,000 to oppose Massachusetts\u2019 marijuana initiative. \n \nOne lingering anti-pot argument is that people will ingest and drive. This happens anyway and it will be illegal everywhere. \n \nNot satisfied, opponents wonder how they will test for marijuana. Field tests still work, but how about we just arm each officer with a chocolate bar, and they could cuff the stoned drivers as they grab for it. \n \nLegalization will come eventually, as it\u2019s only the oldest age groups who are opposed. \n \nAn estimated 15 million Americans use marijuana regularly, and about half our population has admitted trying marijuana. \n \nMarijuana decriminalization bills for the 2017 Texas Legislature, have been filed, including one by El Paso\u2019s own Joe Moody. \n \nRepublicans are increasingly in favor, because of the fiscal benefits and individual freedom arguments. Democrats are already there, and almost everyone wants to decrease the power of the violent drug cartels who smuggle pot across our border. \n \nLet\u2019s legalize it, and have Mexico put up the wall to keep Texans from trafficking marijuana into their country. \n \nEl Paso attorney Steve Fischer has been a professor of criminology and a Texas State Bar director.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \nReleased under special circumstances \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n'The executive order is unlawful' \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \nLegality questioned \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US.

The watch can also be locked or unlocked using a correct combination of short or long breaths. \n \nVoice recognition sometimes produces incorrect words when dictating a text message. Blowing quickly on the watch can erase words, while blowing on it longer will send the text message when ready. \n \nThe technique also works with smartphones. A user can transfer content from the watch to a smartphone simply by sipping it off the watch and puffing it on the phone. \n \nThe technology could have potential for people with disabilities, researchers said. \n \nAnother new interaction technique WatchOut uses taps and scrolling gestures on the case and watchband, outside the watch screen. \n \nThey are possible because of the watch\u2019s gyroscope and accelerometer sensors, according to the researchers. \n \n\u201cOther techniques that improve control of smartwatches have included 3D gestures above the screen, bigger screens or adding an extra armband,\u201d said Cheng Zhang, a PhD student at Georgia Tech. \n \n\u201cWe wanted to show it could be done with existing technology already common on today\u2019s devices,\u201d said Zhang. \n \nOne demo app allows wearers to scroll up, down, left and right by swiping on the watchband. According to Zhang it makes it easier to interact with GPS maps or menus. \n \nThe study showed that scrolling on rubber watchbands was more accurate than leather bands due to the different friction of the materials. \n \nThey also created an app that creates eight touchpoints on the device\u2019s bezel. Rather than scrolling through a long list of apps, the user simply hits one of eight spots on the case to launch Facebook, for example. \n \n\u201cSmartwatches aren\u2019t very convenient when you\u2019re carrying something,\u201d Zhang said. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s why we wanted to create a technique that allows the user to tap the watch to accept or deny phone calls. \n \nHitting the right side answers the call; the left side ignores it,\u201d he said. \n \nThe final project, TapSkin, allows users to tap on the back of their hand to input numbers 0-9 or commands. \n \nThe technique uses the watch\u2019s microphone and inertial sensors to detect a total of 11 different tapping locations on a person\u2019s skin around the watch. \n \nThis is published unedited from the PTI feed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[],"title":"New tech lets you control smartwatches with just your breath!","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"India.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597540856","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"India.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.india.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198570614","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:08Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://s3.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/indiacom-image-banner_01.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The social media giant rolled out three new updates which includes a publisher headline below each topic name, an improved system to determine what is trending and everyone in the same region will see the same topics. The changes in Trending Topics will be made available to everyone in the US in the coming weeks.\n\nFacebook is adding headlines to Trending topics to provide people with more context on what is trending on the social network. \u201cThis was the most requested feature addition since the last update we made to Trending in August,\u201d said Will Cathcart, VP, Product Management, Facebook in a post. Initially, these headlines appeared when users hovered over or clicked on a Trending topic, but can now be seen directly within Trending. Next up, is changing the way Facebook identifies topic. Previously, topics trended due to high engagement on Facebook around a single post or article. However, the update allows a topic to trend based on the number of publishers that are posting articles on Facebook about the same topic, and the engagement around that group of articles. Also, topics that are trending on Facebook will no longer be personalised, which means everyone in the same region will see the same topic. Facebook made changes to Trending Topic in August last year, after a Gizmodo report accused the social media giant of editorial bias against US conservative news organisations in its Trending Section. Facebook denied the charges, and later removed human editors and switched to a more algorithm-driven system for deciding \u2018Trending\u2019 topics. Facebook said the company looked into these claims and found no evidence of systematic bias. \u201cStill, making these changes to the product allows our team to make fewer individual decisions about topics,\u201d the company said in a post.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Tech Desk"},"topics":[{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Cyberculture news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Facebook news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Social media news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Social networks news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"}],"title":"Facebook makes changes to Trending Topics to fight fake news","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Indian Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660698","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"Indian Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198571975","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:25Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/facebook-fake-news-480.jpg?w=480"},{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/facebook-fake-news-480.jpg?w=450"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 17 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bernalillo","zipCode":"87125","state":"New Mexico","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Albuquerque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KOAT","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659419","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"169"},"name":"KOAT","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.koat.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198574063","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Subsequently, this IMC employed a team of technical experts and consultants to reverse the trend of poor performance in agriculture and factories and this is understandable, because the IMC is far from being competent in these areas. \n \nWith this fresh team, GuySuCo advised the nation that it has put together the \u201cbest minds\u201d in sugar to handle the situation in one of its missives from the communication department. Then, came the salaries & benefits of the IMC, experts and consultants which sent shock waves across the land, because no bankrupt company in this world would pay those rates. However, Guyana affords it despite the slave-like wages paid to the ordinary workers. \nAll my optimism vanished in December 2016, when GuySuCo dropped a bombshell production of 183,652 tonnes for the year 2016. After having this team of \u201cbest minds\u201d in sugar for 1 ½ years, paid them better than any country would, they delivered the second lowest production since 1990. \n \nFrom their own performance, one can conclude that GuySuCo\u2019s biggest burden at this point is the IMC, experts and consultants, whose remuneration amounts to GS14.1M/month. That is, GS253.8M over that last 18 months. They are akin to a millstone around GuySuCo\u2019s neck. The President has the power to remove this burden from GuySuCo and taxpayers. \nWith this millstone management team at GuySuCo, production for 2017 may be bleak again. GuySuCo may wish to dispute this as they typically do with vague statements and no details. In the meantime, what is GuySuCo\u2019s production target this year? This is the first time that it is not yet known, though we are approaching the end of January, 2017. \n \nRegards, \nSookram Persaud","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[],"title":"GuySuCo under scrutiny","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"South America","countryCode":"GY","country":"Guyana"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Guyana Chronicle Online","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169775604","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Guyana Chronicle Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.guyanachronicleonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://guyanachronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/how-to-write-a-letter.jpg","http://www.guyanachronicle.com/advertise"],"sequenceId":"695198576065","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T03:48:16Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Captain Scott Curry restored the host's lead after the break and then the game ebbed and flowed until Bazan Velez went in again to make it 12-12. \n \nBut another New Zealand turnover settle the issue and Franco Sabato won the match for Argentina with a try in the corner. \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \nHaving won the last three editions of this event, finishing sixth wasn't particularly impressive. However there were encouraging signs in the shape of forward Iopu Iopu-Aso and playmaker Koroi. \n \nKoroi is just out of Feilding High School, but his Wellington cameos suggest the 18-year-old has talent. \n \nTalent of the sort that made Manawatu's Tomasi Cama one of the most feared ball-players on the sevens circuit. Cama is now co-coach of New Zealand and picked Koroi despite him not appearing at the recent national tournament. \n \n\"He's probably better than me,\" Cama said of Koroi. \n  \nThe teenager produced some magical touches to guide New Zealand to a 24-0 win over England in their fifth-place semifinal and looks to have a bit to offer, having played on the wing for New Zealand Secondary Schools last year. \n \n\"This is his first tournament and for a young fella he looks like he's been playing for a few years now. There's always things to work on and hopefully he's going to kick on from now,\" said Cama. \n \n\"When you look at playmakers, obviously they can pass, they can kick. But one thing they do have, they do have time when they have the ball and that's when they look forward and make decisions.\" \n \nIt's Koroi's composure that really excites Cama. \n \n\"At this stage I don't have to do a lot. He's got all the talent. If anything it's just the little things we can work on off the field to make sure that he gets out there and does what he does best.\" \n \nKoroi can't quite believe this is happening. He grew up idolising players such as Cama and team-mates DJ Forbes and Tim Mikkelson. Being picked for Wellington was one thing, but the idea he might play - and play well - was quite another. \n \n\"I've been very nervous playing out there. Very nervous,\" Koroi said. \n \nIt's just that he hasn't played like a nervous bloke. \n \n\"Just like Junior [Cama] says, when you get out on the field just play your game [and] stay calm under pressure, because you're a playmaker.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HAMISH BIDWELL"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"NZ sinks to 6th at 7s","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dominion Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672420","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Dominion Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Rugby","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198581886","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Zemgus Girgensons and Jack Eichel also scored, and Anders Nilsson stopped 24 shots to help the Sabres improve to 2-4-3 in their last eight. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of areas where we did well in the game tonight in terms of how we want to play,\u201d Buffalo coach Dan Bylsma said. \u201cOur defense did a simple but good job with their execution with the puck and their moving the puck north, getting the puck up to our forwards. It was probably our best game in the third period with the lead playing the way we need to play.\u201d \n \nSam Reinhart had two assists, extending his career-best points streak to seven games and giving him two goals and seven assists in that stretch. \n \n \nBuffalo has beaten the Rangers in three straight meetings \u2014 including twice this season \u2014 after losing the previous nine. \n \n\u201cWe played a pretty simple game for 60 minutes and had success,\u201d Eichel said. \u201cAt times this season, we\u2019ve gotten away from our game. You can see in the third period, we didn\u2019t really give them much at all. A lot of pucks were north and in their zone and it seemed like we played with it in their zone.\u201d \n \nNick Holden scored and Henrik Lundqvist made 15 saves for the Rangers, who were trying for their first four-game winning streak since a five-game run Oct. 30 to Nov. 6. \n \nNew York trailed 3-0 early in the second period before picking up its intensity. Holden got the Rangers on the scoreboard with 4:05 remaining in the middle period as he took a pass from J.T. Miller and fired a slap shot past Nilsson for his eighth of the season. \n \nThe Sabres restored their three-goal lead on the power play at 1:10 of the third. Reinhart sent a pass from the left faceoff dot to Eichel, who was streaking to the net and poked it in for his seventh. \n \nNew York didn\u2019t get its first shot of the third period until there was only 5:28 left. \n \n\u201cThey kind of came out hard in the second (period), pushed us back a little bit,\u201d Nilsson said. \u201cWe scored a goal early and they got one late, but came out of the second period fine. And it was fun to stand back during the third and see the way we play, the way we shut the door and shut them down.\u201d \n \nThe Rangers didn\u2019t manage their first shot on goal until Ryan McDonagh\u2019s wrister that was stopped by Nilsson 9:54 into the first period. \n \nBuffalo got on the scoreboard with 7:43 left in the opening period. Brian Gionta sent a centering pass from the left corner that deflected off William Carrier\u2019s skate, and Girgensons backhanded it in from the right side for his fourth. \n \n\u201cThey kind of set the tone in the first 10 minutes, and obviously they got some timely goals,\u201d Lundqvist said. \u201c(We) made some mistakes, and it\u2019s my job to be there and clean it up, but was just not able to do that.\u201d \n \nThe Rangers then had two nice chances just seven seconds apart, but Chris Kreider\u2019s attempt from in close was stopped by Nilsson with four minutes to go, and then Derek Stepan\u2019s shot was gloved by the goalie. \n \nThe Sabres made it 2-0 in the final minute, taking advantage when the Rangers turned the puck over during a line change. Lundqvist stopped Reinhart\u2019s attempt, but Kane was driving to the net and knocked in the rebound with just under 39 seconds remaining for his ninth. \n \nBailey made it 3-0 with his first NHL goal 1:03 into the second. Kane trailed Rangers defensemen Kevin Klein after a loose puck up the right side into New York\u2019s defensive zone, and Klein sent a pass to the left that Bailey grabbed and fired past Lundqvist while jumping in the air to avoid Klein, who went sliding by. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a game of turnovers and especially when you have a play like that when handling pucks,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised but happy that I could get up there and score a goal.\u201d \n \nNOTES: Sabres C Johan Larsson is out indefinitely and likely lost for the season after having surgery Monday for a dislocated wrist and elbow. Larsson was injured during a 3-1 loss at Boston on Saturday. ... The Sabres have won three in a row against the Rangers for the first time since Dec. 12, 2009, to April 6, 2010. ... Eichel has three goals and four assists in five career games against the Rangers. ... The teams conclude their three-game season series on Feb. 2 at Buffalo. ... Rangers coach Alain Vigneault broke a tie with Herb Brooks for seventh place on franchise\u2019s games coached list with 286. ...

As we walk the tightrope therefore, of accessibility, evidenced by our ongoing island-wide roll-out of public access wi-fi facilities and safeguard, Government\u2019s proposed Data Protection Act is due for tabling later this year. \n\nThe creation of a Single ICT Regulator with the mandate of ensuring cohesion across the regulatory elements of ICT, will naturally include the framework to promote privacy and protect data. \n\nThe Government of Jamaica is seized of the importance of data protection and cyber security, especially in light of recent upsurge in cyber-attacks, including website defacements, denial of service, spear-phishing and ransomware. \n\nWe encourage you to visit: www.stopthinkconnect.org.jm for additional ways to be \u2018cyber safe\u2019 and also practice the following simple and effective data privacy safeguard measures. \n\n\u2022 Always check and configure app and website privacy settings \n\n\u2022 Enable remote location and device wiping \n\n\u2022 Resist sharing too much information on social networking sites \n\n\u2022 Customize your social networking privacy settings \n\n\u2022 Avoid sensitive transactions on public Wi-Fi \n\n\u2022 Always remember to sign out \n\nRemember, be vigilant online: Stop and Think before you click.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ministry of Science, Energy & Technology"},"topics":[{"name":"Personal data privacy news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Jamaica news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Message From Dr. Hon.

It was a tough race. It pushed me to go a little faster.\u201d \n \nMartinez, the only runner back from the unit that set the mark in 2016, was confident the lineup was primed for a possible new standard. \n \n\u201cIt was a great team and I thought we could shave a few seconds off,\u201d said Martinez, who clocked a 2:01.94 in the 800 leg. \n \nOlympic 1,500 champion Matt Centrowitz Jr. held off challenges from Vincent Kibet of Kenya and Great Britain\u2019s Jake Wightman to win the mile in 3:55.78. Centrowitz closed the last 400 in a blazing 55.2 for the victory. Kibet was clocked in 3:56.09 and Wightman registered a 3:57.24. \n \nKenya\u2019s Hellen Obiri used her impressive kick to hold off Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands in the women\u2019s 3,000. Obiri looked vulnerable with Hassan bearing down on her and two laps to go, but she switched gears for the 8:39.08 victory. Hassan was second at 8:40.99. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m very happy to win,\u201d said Obiri. \u201cI felt strong and was looking forward to a fast finish.\u201d \n \nThe showdown between world record-holder Jenn Suhr and 2016 Olympic-champion Ekaterina Stefanidi of Greece in the pole vault never materialized as Suhr was forced to pull out of the competition with an injury. Stefanidi went on to win easily with a height of 15-21\u20444. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m not super excited about the height,\u201d said Stefanidi. \u201cI\u2019m happy to win and this is my first meet of the season, so I can\u2019t expect too much or be too disappointed.\u201d \n \nStefanidi went back to a longer approach on the runway and felt comfortable with the results. \n \n\u201cEverything went very well actually,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a very bad competing-alone person, so the second I won the competition I kind of relaxed. I jumped a decent height. Jenn was hurting. She said something before the meet and she didn\u2019t push it, which is smart.\u201d \n \nThe girls\u2019 junior mile had a local cross country flavor with All-State Division 1 champion Grace Connolly of Natick and Bridget Mitchell, the Div. 2 champion, both in the field. The sophomore phenom Connolly raced to an indoor personal best of 4:56.02 for fourth overall while Mitchell took ninth in 4:59.29. Jacqueline Gaughan sprinted past Abbe Goldstein in the final 200 for the win in 4:52.57 as the top nine all cracked five minutes. \n \nConnolly was surprised by the slowish early pace with such a talented field. \n \n\u201cI was expecting it to go out a lot faster than we did,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew this field would be competitive. It\u2019s my biggest race of the season.\u201d \n \nMitchell, who set a personal best of 4:57 two weeks ago in a Bay State Conference dual meet, spent the second half of the race fighting to move up. \n \n\u201cI was trying to get in the second lane and get a good position, but everyone else was trying to do that too,\u201d said Mitchell. \n \nNewburyport\u2019s Jack Carleo surged across the finish line for sixth in the junior mile in 4:2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"United States women set world record in distance medley at New Balance Grand Prix","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Middlesex","zipCode":"02149","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Everett","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Boston Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661766","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Boston Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bostonherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198598798","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Why? \n \nI supported (President Muhammadu) Buhari in the last (presidential) election. I actively campaigned for him and donated my money to his campaign. If I have turned against him, it is since he got into office and based entirely on his government\u2019s policy choices. I have nothing personal against him. \n       \nAt what point exactly did you start losing hope in Buhari and promise of \u2018change\u2019? \n \nIt was sometime midway last year. It just became clear to me that the government sold one thing during the campaign and were doing another thing entirely upon assumption of power. The sheer pointless and needless suffering Nigerians have been put through in the name of discredited ideas and waste-of-time economic policies has been too much to bear. For me, Nigeria is the point of any support and I consider it a serious mistake on my part to have blindly supported Buhari like I did in 2015. \n \nAnd, are you really sorry, if you had led some Nigerians during the 2015 presidential election, to support Buhari? \n \nYes, I am. I feel like I told people I was a mechanic and then they asked for my opinion on a car they wanted to buy. Without opening the engine, I simply told them to buy the car based on how the body looked. I can\u2019t speak for anyone else but the lesson for me is that no matter how much you dislike someone and want to get rid of them \u2013 and I really disliked Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s government \u2013 it is important to always be sceptical even for your own side. We did not question Buhari hard enough. We should have pressed him harder to force him to make clear commitments and adopt clear positions we wanted before the elections. Something like taking six months to appoint ministers was such an irritating and costly waste of time. And it came as a surprise to even his supporters. But we all gave him the benefit of the doubt. We allowed him to get away with too much too easily. \n \nThe President has been accused of shielding the corruption of his close aides. Do you still think Buhari and his administration has some integrity? \n \nAt any rate, the Secretary to Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal\u2019s letter which carried his (Buhari\u2019s) signature is the end of any anti-corruption illusion anyone might still carry about him. To have risked his reputation for a man who has not exactly set the world of governance on fire is a double tragedy. \n \nDo you think he is sincere and serious about fighting corruption in Nigeria? \n \nHe might have the right intentions but it is suffering from the pervasive sickness of Nigeria \u2013 incompetence. Money is not really being recovered and cases are either being bungled or progressing very slowly. Most of what has been recovered has been real estate and expensive items. In this economy, it is very difficult to turn those things into money. And the longer people get away with not giving up their stolen wealth or their freedom, the greater their chances of getting away with it completely. This is Nigeria after all. \n \nDoes it not bother you that Buhari seems bent on having Ibrahim Magu confirmed as substantive Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, despite a Department of State Services\u2019 report on and the Senate\u2019s rejection of Magu? \n \nHe clearly likes (Ibrahim) Magu. The President has investigated and found him worthy. In the grand scheme of things, the fight against corruption is now like garri that has been overcome by water. \n \nPeople feel Nigeria\u2019s security agencies are tied to the government\u2019s apron strings. Is there anything that can be done to free these agencies of political control? \n \nThere are examples we can copy. Romania is a good one. The anti-corruption agency has been strengthened with good laws and gets a lot of independent foreign funding. As a result, it has been able to do its job freely. You will still need to hire the right person but maybe having independent sources of funding will be a good idea. \n \nSome people have said there is no difference between Jonathan and Buhari when it comes to fighting corruption. What do you think? \n \nThere\u2019s probably a lot less money to steal now. Price of crude oil is $50. But it raises an interesting question: if people are still stealing the small money available now, will they steal more if oil goes to $100? How would Jonathan\u2019s people have coped with half price of crude oil? The more important issue for me is this: Jonathan failed Nigeria. Buhari is failing Nigeria. Depending on how Buhari finishes his term, he can still overtake Jonathan in the unfortunate stakes. \n \nSome have called for the President\u2019s resignation. Do you think that is a good idea? \n \n(Calling for the President\u2019s) resignation won\u2019t be a bad idea. It is the honourable thing for him to do. He is clearly not up to the job; that is the fundamental problem with this government. \n \nWhat do you think about the Presidency\u2019s communication strategy? \n \nI always say that Aso Rock was designed in a way that there are no windows looking outside onto the world. It sounds trivial but it says something about how we have designed leadership in Nigeria. We have physically isolated our leaders with the way we built the seat of power. Maybe one day we will get lucky by having a historically aware president who decides to bring leadership closer to the people. Until then, I don\u2019t expect anything out of Aso Rock to change. \n \nCopyright PUNCH.                 \nAll rights reserved.

If so, then who was the first one in Thibodaux to own an automobile? In reply you may ask: 'Why bring that up now?'\" \n \n\u201cOn Monday of this week,\u201d Taylor continued, \u201ca Thibodaux gentleman rang up the editor of the Comet and wanted to know who owned the first auto to be driven over the streets of Thibodaux? It was an altogether unexpected question, but we replied that, as far as we could remember, Dr. Felix Riviere was the first man here to have a car. \n \n\u201cThen we added that possibly it was Albert Trone, but we were not certain just which one was first. Since the phone conversation we are inclined to the belief that Mr. Trone was the first, he driving a one-seat, topless car on the streets here during the early part of 1909. \n \n\u201cOur questioner suggested: 'Was it not a Mr. Legendre, whose first name was Oleus?' \n \n\u201cWe replied 'no', for the man whose first name was Oleus is still roaming around waiting for Father Time to 'get him'. Then we added that the last name was 'Legendre', but the first name, we thought, was 'Joe', there having been several 'Joe Legendres' in this town, but just after the phone conversation we called to mind that the correct name was 'Frank Legendre'. \n \n\u201cHe had what his friends called a 'one lung' automobile, they calling it that way because it had but one cylinder and used to make the familiar noise of 'chug-chug', thus attracting attention wherever it went.\u201d \n \nTaylor's automotive ramble continued: \u201cOne day, along in 1910, the Legendre 'horseless carriage' was passing our home. The late T.R. Simmons was in his room across the way in a two-story building where Hotel Jeffries now stands. Mr. Simmons, who was quite friendly with the late Mr. Legendre, raised the sash of a window and yelled out to the horseless carriage: 'Take that lawn-mower off the street,' but Mr. Legendre did not do it. He went right along with the 'chug-chug' carriage. \n \n\u201cWe could mention a few other things about auto incidents of the past, but that might bore. Especially would we relate how the honest statement that 'we had no trouble at all.' \n \n\u201cYou could believe that statement as long as you did not look at the driver's hands, for very few motorists went out those days and came back with clean hands, it being necessary for all of them to 'get out and get under' to find out why in the mischief the old machine would not work. \n \n\u201cHowever they invariably tried to deceive (not exactly 'lie' about the matter), but their mistake was to have with them a 'wife', a 'sister' or a 'child', so the 'day after the day before' the wife, sister or child would tell friends, confidentially, about the 'delightful' trip and suddenly the wife, sister or child would forget and say that 'everything was fine until we had a puncture', or until the spark plugs would not work, or the battery went 'dead,' so, then the 'cat was out of the bag' and every one knew that the trip to Labadieville or Lafourche Crossing was not such a 'dream', it being learned that 'Pa' had to get out and sweat pumping up a leaky tube, or 'Ma' had to help find the tools, she not knowing a monkey wrench from a screw-driver, but 'Ma' has since learned, and she can crank a car in fine fashion, especially if the engine is a self-starter.\u201d \n \nTaylor's rambling recollection was not nearly over: \n \n\u201cBut all of these 'pleasant' or 'unpleasant' events have passed away ,and they are practically forgotten, but what we'd like to know is this: \n \n\u201cWho was the first person in Lafourche to drive a horse and buggy over the Raceland-Des Allemands-New Orleans road? We are not over-anxious to know, but the thought often flashes across our mind about the one who had the supreme pleasure. We remember recording in the Comet, about 20 years ago, about the trip being made over the road, but then we did not have the name of the person who performed such a feat. \n \n\u201cWe are practically certain that no one in Thibodaux knows, but there are some citizens around Raceland or Lockport who know. Maybe, Hon Frank Barker the member of the Police Jury from Ward 9, can tell, because he was largely instrumental in having a road built through the swamp, that years ago stood as an impenetrable barrier to any one or anything save the 'iron horse' of the S.P.R.R. (Southern Pacific Railroad). \n \n\u201cTo others it appeared a dense, watery forest, infested with reptiles, that could not be overcome.

Kennedy International Airport on Friday night and was detained for about five hours.\n\nTrump's order signed on Friday upended the travel plans of people without U.S. citizenship who were arriving in the United States from those seven countries, including Syria, Iran and Sudan, causing confusion and sparking protests at airports as immigrants and refugees were stranded.\n\nElamin said she had been in Sudan for academic research and boarded a plane on Friday morning. After presenting her U.S. green card, a designation of legal permanent residence, at JFK, she said she was questioned, patted down and handcuffed.\n\n\"It was an uncomfortable pat down, they touched my breast area and my groin area,\" Elamin said in a phone interview. \"Then I got handcuffed and I just started crying.\"\n\nElamin said the handcuffs were soon removed and it appeared authorities were using them to escort people between areas of the airport.\n\nElamin was released, but she worried about leaving the country again and about her parents in Sudan, whom she hoped one day to help immigrate to America.\n\n\"It scares me that I'm not able to see them if I want to,\" said Elamin, who lives in New Jersey.\n\nTrump's executive order means legal permanent residents who have passports from the seven countries have to be cleared back into the United States on a case-by-case basis, a senior U.S. administration official told reporters.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which overseas entry at airports, in a statement later said it will \"treat all of those we encounter humanely and with professionalism.\"\n\nThe executive order also upended the plans of some people planning to leave the United States.\n\nShirana Navabha, 57, a U.S. citizen originally from Iran, said she was scheduled to fly to Iran on Sunday, but will not go after Tehran said it would stop U.S. citizens entering the country in retaliation to Trump's action.\n\n\"I told everybody that I'm coming, everyone was so excited and now I'm not going, it's just frustrating,\" Navabha, who lives in Dallas, said by phone.

And (expletive) you too pay me.\u201d \n   \nAlthough he admitted he hadn\u2019t heard all of McGregor\u2019s words, White\u2019s pointed response was the most serious counter to the lightweight champ\u2019s brash form of self-promotion, which has frequently targeted the UFC as he\u2019s grown into one of its biggest stars. The executive didn\u2019t entirely take the bait, however, linking McGregor\u2019s statement to efforts to push an online product. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear all that,\u201d White said. \u201cHey, listen, when you\u2019re about to do a pay-per-view that you\u2019re charging people five bucks to listen to you talk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got to say some pretty crazy (expletive).\u201d \n \nAs the crazy idea of ever seeing Mayweather and McGregor in a ring, White shot that down, too. \n \n\u201cHere\u2019s what I think the chances are: About the same as me being the backup quarterback for (Tom) Brady on (Super Bowl) Sunday,\u201d he said. \n \nWhite previously made headlines when he offered Mayweather and McGregor $25 million each and a cut of pay-per-view profits to step into the squared circle. Mayweather dismissed the offer outright. \n \nSince that exchange, White said there\u2019d been no talks with the Mayweather camp and added his offer didn\u2019t signal a renewed interest in the bout. \n \n\u201c(I made an offer) because (Mayweather) was full of (expletive),\u201d White said. \u201cHe said he had made an offer, which wasn\u2019t true. So I made a real offer.\u201d \n \nIs there a chance, though, all the talk is just a prelude to a blockbuster? \n \n\u201cI\u2019ll be suiting up Sunday,\u201d White deadpanned. \n \nFor more on UFC on FOX 23 , check out the UFC Events section of MMAjunkie. \n  \nUFC on FOX 23 , Featured , Featured Videos , News , UFC , Videos","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Steven Marrocco"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dana White issues warning to Conor McGregor after Instagram outburst","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Taylor","zipCode":"79601","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Abilene","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Abilene Reporter","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169730061","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"269"},"name":"Abilene Reporter","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://reporternews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mmajunkie.com/author/mmajunkiesteven","http://mmajunkie.com/author/justin-park","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/conor-mcgregor-boasts-5000-attendance-for-live-ppv-interview-and-declares-expletive-the-ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/dana-white-offers-conor-mcgregor-and-floyd-mayweather-25-million-each-and-ppv-cut","http://mmajunkie.com/events/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/events","http://mmajunkie.com/tag/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured-videos","http://mmajunkie.com/category/news","http://mmajunkie.com/category/ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/category/videos","http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"],"sequenceId":"695198620887","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:08:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D.

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Delaware Valley news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Monmouth","zipCode":"07728","state":"New Jersey","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Freehold","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Freehold Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172244062","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Freehold Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.freehold.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695198641672","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She's detail oriented,\u201d Alisobhani\u2019s mother says of her daughter who also lives in Orange County. \n \nThe bride, an Iranian-American Muslim, and her Jewish fiancé thought figuring out how to combine each family\u2019s religious traditions into their wedding would be the hardest part, but after inviting more than 400 guests and finding the perfect venue, it\u2019s likely nearly one-third of Alisobhani and her fiancé\u2019s guests - Alisobhani\u2019s Iranian-born family - may be banned from coming. \n \n\u201cEverything is so uncertain right now,\u201d she says. \n \nOn Friday, President Trump signed an executive order temporarily banning travel from Iran and six other majority-Muslim countries, as well as temporarily suspending the U.S. refugee program. \n \n\u201cIt's heartbreaking,\u201d Alisobhani says. \u201cPart of the reason I wanted a huge wedding was so all of my family could be together \u2026 My mom came here in 1977 and her siblings haven't been in one place since she left Iran.\u201d \n \nAt her mother\u2019s wedding in 1986 almost none of her family was able to attend for the same reason. Now her wedding is the family's chance at a do-over. \n \n\u201cI think it's more certain that they are not coming than them coming, which is just devastating,\u201d she says emotionally. \n \nAlisobhani says they tried to prepare for stricter rules: Members of her family who didn't have green cards applied for visas. \n \n\u201cNow, they just halted it completely,\u201d she laments. \u201cI don't know what's going to happen.\u201d \n \nThis new ban, she explains, is part of a stigma her family has tried to shed for years. \u201cMost of them left Iran as a result of the revolution and so to basically to be tied back to this regime is just so heartbreaking because it's just not fair to them.\u201d \n \nPublished 1 minute ago","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Bride's Iranian Family May be Banned From CA Wedding","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"90001","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Los Angeles","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"NBC Los Angeles","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667999","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"NBC Los Angeles","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nbclosangeles.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/national-international/Trump-Order-Aimed-at-Terrorists-Sparks-Confusion-412055403.html"],"sequenceId":"695198642637","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

More were spotted on the A293, coming off the Shoreham by-pass. \n \nThe It Can Wait police campaign was launched just months after lorry driver Tomasz Korker was jailed for 10 years for killing a woman and her three children. \n \nHe was scrolling through music on his mobile phone when he hit the car on the A34. \n \nOfficers were out this week looking for anyone making calls, sending texts or checking traffic updates on their phones while driving and to warn them in March they could face double the penalty \u2013 £200 and six points on their licence. \n \nSergeant Philip Badman, of Sussex Police Roads Policing Unit, said the law was there to keep people alive. \n \nHe said: \u201cWe get reports of drivers using phones on a daily basis without a doubt. I have seen far too many incidents where drivers were distracted by their phones \u2013 and it\u2019s not worth it. \n \n\"Checking a text seems so insignificant \u2013 both at the time, but also once you\u2019ve crashed, and lives have been changed.\u201d \n \nTraffic officer Police Constable Phil Barrow said: \u201cYou have to knock on too many doors to tell people their loved ones are not coming home. \n \n\"We understand people have busy lives but is always best to pull into a lay-by.\u201d \n \nA council spokeswoman said: \u201cUsing a mobile phone while driving is both in violation of the law, and against our own policy and procedures. This is made very clear to all our drivers and our contractors as part of their training. \n \n\"It is unacceptable for an employee or contractor to use a mobile phone while driving a council vehicle, as the image appears to show. \n \n\"We are asking Mears to carry out an investigation into the matter.\u201d \n \nA Pristine London spokesman said it takes such matters \u201cvery seriously\u201d and would investigate. He said employees are given hands-free kits and are reminded of the law and advised to turn phones off in busy areas. \n \nREACHING FOR THE PHONE? REMEMBER, IT CAN WAIT \n \nFEW will have missed the harrowing footage showing the moment a thoughtless lorry driver drove into the back of a car, killing a mother and her three children. \n \nTracy Houghton, 45, her sons, Ethan, 13, Josh, 11, and stepdaughter, Aimee, 11, died instantly on the A34 in Berkshire while on their way home from a camping trip. \n \nAnd all because Tomasz Kroker had been absently mindedly flicking through music on his phone at the time. \n \nThe cold reality of the dash-cam video recording is so distressing that it means, no matter how many times it is seen, its effect will never lessen. \n \nIt is cruel because we know if it were not for the mobile phone, it would never have happened. \n \nIt is abhorrent because we know an hour earlier 30-year-old Kroker, of Trajan Walk, Andover, Hampshire, had signed a declaration promising his employer he would not use his phone at the wheel. \n \nHe pleaded guilty and was jailed for 10 years. By all accounts he was hugely remorseful. \n \nBut Justice Maura McGowan said no powers the court had would lessen the \u201cdevastating loss experienced in those affected\u201d. \n \nThe news came as figures showed the number of fines issued for the offence across the country had fallen by more than 106,000 between 2011 and 2015. \n \nThe victims\u2019 family took a very brave step in agreeing to the video\u2019s release. But it had to be published to show the worst possible consequences of using a mobile phone while driving. \n \nEveryone hopes high-profile cases will deter other drivers but it does not always stop everyone from kicking the habit of a phone taking precedence. \n \nSadly, the risk is closer to home than we think. \n \nIn May, Mark Martin was jailed after being distracted by his mobile phone and causing a catastrophic crash on the A23 at Bolney. \n \nThe 39-year-old, of Wrentham Avenue, Herne Bay, Kent, was at the wheel of a Volvo car transporter travelling north when it smashed into a stationary Fiat Punto, just north of the A272 slip road, on September 16, 2015, leaving the 36-year-old driver with life changing injuries. \n \nHe pleaded guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving and was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment at Brighton Crown Court. He was also disqualified from driving for two years and ordered to pay costs. \n \nAnd The Argus has this week caught on camera several motorists, including some at work, with a mobile phone in hand behind the wheel on busy roads including along the seafront by Brighton Palace Pier where there is a notoriously busy section of pedestrian crossings. \n \nWith the Kroker case in mind, Sussex Police officers stepped onto the streets with renewed purpose this week ready to tell drivers about the Sussex Safer Roads Partnership campaign It Can Wait. \n \nPatrols were dispatched to known hot spots in Brighton and Hove, Arundel, Chichester, Worthing, Polegate, Eastbourne and Hastings to catch people in the act, to deter them and raise awareness of the proposed change in the law. \n  \nSo far at least 10 mobile phone offences were recorded in East Sussex over the week and a similar number in West Sussex. But final figures are yet to be confirmed. \n \nThis newspaper joined police on their patrols along the seafront near Hove Lagoon as well as Royal Square, in Marine Parade and Black Rock in Brighton on Thursday. \n \nDespite the near sub-zero temperatures they spent hours on the look-out for drivers using phones, as well as drivers speeding or not wearing seat belt and other road traffic offences. \n \nThe camera van sets up in a layby while officers are on stand-by nearby to stop any suspected offenders. \n \nCamera technician Paul Marwick said they use top-of-the-range near high definition equipment which can capture clear recordings that can be used as evidence. \n \nMr Marwick said: \u201cPurely anecdotally and based on what I have seen I think since the high-profile cases and it being written about in the media people are becoming more aware.\u201d \n \nDrivers will be either stopped by a patrol further down the road or contacted by letter with a warning, asked to pay a fine or face prosecution. \n \nCampaign leader Sergeant Phil Badman said: \u201cThe campaigns are a really good way to speak to a lot of drivers and have a visible presence. For our teams this is business as usual as we look to tackle these offences on a daily basis.\u201d \n \nPolice Constable Phil Barrow, a traffic officer based in Polegate, was on duty. \n \nHe said: \u201cI am generally roaming roads covering the whole of Sussex on a motorbike. \n \n\u201cI wear several cameras and keep in touch with patrols to share information. This week we\u2019ve been reminding people they will get caught and also to educate them about the new law that\u2019s expected to come in.\u201d \n \nPENALTIES MAY DOUBLE \n \nHARSHER penalties are expected for drivers caught using a mobile phone. \n \nNow they can be fined £100 with three points. They could also be prosecuted, banned and given a fine up to £1,000 or £2,500 for bus or goods vehicle drivers. \n \nFrom March 1 the law could change, with punishments doubling. There may no longer be the option to take part in a driver improvement course to reduce the penalty. New drivers could lose their licence if caught just once. \n \nMore than 40 drivers were caught every hour during a week-long police crackdown in November. \n \nOfficers across the country issued 7,966 fixed penalty notices. \n \nThe tally, equivalent to more than 1,000 every day and 47 an hour, is the highest for a week of enforcement on distraction driving. \n \nIn March, officers stopped 105 drivers in Sussex. \n \nThey issued 101 with fixed penalty notices or traffic offence reports. \n \nThree were given verbal warnings and one a court summons. \n \nMost offences were by men and those over 25.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"35","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"East Sussex","zipCode":"BN1","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Brighton and Hove","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"East Bourne Independent.co.uk","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"590203408","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"East Bourne Independent.co.uk","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.eastbourneindependent.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198646589","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

All four of their Super Bowl victories have come since the 2001 season with that venerable coach-quarterback pair, with this their seventh appearance together. \n \nThen there are the Atlanta Falcons, still seeking their first Vince Lombardi Trophy after 51 years. \n \nThough this pairing of teams with such disparate title-game histories is striking, it's not exactly uncommon. Here's a look back at some of the other memorable championship matchups involving trophy-case inequity in major sports: \n \nYANKEES PROWESS: Less than two months after the terrorist attacks knocked down the World Trade Center towers, the New York Yankees had the country behind them for once during the 2001 World Series as emotional renditions of \"God Bless America\" stirred fans and players alike. Having won four of the previous five World Series, bringing their all-time total to 26 of what's now 27 titles, the Yankees faced a Diamondbacks team in its mere fourth season of existence, let alone lacking a championship. Arizona's purple and teal uniforms clashed with the navy pinstripes donned by the Yankees for decades. The games in Phoenix were played under a retractable roof in an airplane-hangar-like ballpark with a swimming pool behind center field instead of the hallowed monuments looming there at Yankee Stadium. \n \nThe Diamondbacks proved they belonged between the lines, though, with Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling comprising a dominant duo of starting pitchers that kept Yankees stars Derek Jeter, Tino Martinez and Bernie Williams quiet at the plate. In a Game 7 for the ages, Luis Gonzalez drove in the winning run in the bottom of the ninth inning with a single off often-unhittable closer Mariano Rivera. \n \nSO CLOSE: Duke, every bit the villain the Yankees have usually been, had no such national support in the 2010 NCAA basketball championship game. Not only were coach Mike Krzyzewski and the Blue Devils approaching their fourth of five titles, but they were playing lovable underdog Butler. \n \nThe Final Four that year was in Indianapolis, too, just a few miles away from where the Bulldogs play. Though Butler's Hinkle Fieldhouse has a rich history, the Bulldogs don't have the cachet Duke carries. One of the all-time upsets nearly happened when Gordon Hayward's heave from half court hit the backboard and the front rim before bouncing out at the buzzer to give the Blue Devils a 61-59 victory. \n \nSTEELY RESOLVE: No team has won more Super Bowls than the Pittsburgh Steelers with six titles in the 50-year history of the event. Few franchises have been around for so long with so little accolade as the Arizona Cardinals, who date back to St. Louis and Chicago. \n \nThe Cardinals nearly pulled off a championship stunner following a 2008 season during which their 9-7 record was good enough to win a weak division. The Steelers led 20-7 midway through the fourth quarter in Tampa, Florida, before a pair of touchdown passes from Kurt Warner to Larry Fitzgerald sandwiched around a safety put the Cardinals in front. But Ben Roethlisberger deftly drove the Steelers for the go-ahead score on a throw to Santonio Holmes with 35 seconds left. The 16-point rally by the Cardinals would've been the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history. \n \nFOREVER YOUNG: Sometimes the result on the field mirrors the imbalance in historical success. The San Francisco 49ers became the first team to win a fifth Super Bowl, when they blew out the San Diego Chargers 49-26 to close the 1994-95 season in superior fashion. \n \nSteve Young threw six touchdown passes, still a Super Bowl record. He found Jerry Rice for a 44-yard score just three plays into the game against a Chargers team making its only Super Bowl appearance. \n \nWORTH MENTIONING: Pittsburgh Penguins beat San Jose Sharks in 2016 Stanley Cup finals. North Carolina beats Illinois in 2005 NCAA basketball championship game. Los Angeles Lakers beat Indiana Pacers in 2000 NBA finals. St. Louis Cardinals beat Milwaukee Brewers in 1982 World Series. \n \n___ \n \nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - Arizona Cardinals news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: MLB - St Louis Cardinals news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - Atlanta Falcons news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - Pittsburgh Steelers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: MLB - New York Yankees news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - New England Patriots news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Patriots-Falcons, the latest case of trophy inequity","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Wetzel","zipCode":"26155","state":"West Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"New Martinsville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wetzel Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169886263","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Wetzel Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wetzelchronicle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.pro32.ap.org/","http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"],"sequenceId":"695198651455","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

His idea was to create a two-wheeled wagon to hold the boat. To pull the boat, he removed the back seat of the lumberman\u2019s speedy Model T and attached the wagon. It worked. They called the contraption a \u201ctrailer.\u201d The rest, as they say, is history. \n \nRuth Ann Fruehauf will relate the history of the firm that was founded in Detroit by her grandfather August 3-4:30 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 12,  at the Bloomfield Township Public Library. Fruehauf Trailer Co. created an industry, establishing a global presence with 26,000 employees worldwide. \n \nFruehauf, author of \"Singing Wheels\" and several other books on the company, graduated from Cranbrook Kingswood School.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 19 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"40202","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Louisville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Louisville Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"540"},"name":"Louisville Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198663303","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The top two candidates from the April 23 first round will go through to the May 7 runoff. \n \nFillon\u2019s campaign has, however, been dealt a serious blow by claims that he used public money to give his wife a \u201cfake job\u201d. \n \nFrench authorities this week opened a preliminary inquiry into allegations that Fillon\u2019s Welsh-born wife Penelope collected half a million euros ($534,000) over eight years as a parliamentary aide to her husband and his successor -\u2014 for little to no work. \n \nInvestigators are also looking into payments she received from a magazine owned by a friend of Fillon. \n \nFillon, who won the conservative Republicans\u2019 nomination last year with promises to slash public spending and restore morality in politics, has insisted that his wife played a real role and complained he is the victim of a smear campaign. \n \nOn Sunday, he will address a Paris rally to try to shore up his support, after an Odoxa poll Friday which showed his approval ratings falling four points to 38 percent. \n \nHours ahead of the gathering in the capital he vowed in an interview with the Journal du Dimanche newspaper that he would fight \u201cto the end\u201d against the \u201cforces at work to silence me and to weaken my candidacy\u201d. \n \n\u2013 Macron, Melenchon winners? \u2013 \n \nThe Socialist primary has confirmed a gaping chasm within the ruling party, between a pragmatic, centre-left camp led by Valls and President Francois Hollande and a staunchly leftist faction around Hamon. \n \nHamon won a first round of voting last week that whittled the candidates down from seven to two, taking 36 percent to Valls\u2019 31.5 percent. \n \nOne of the biggest potential winners of the primary could be former economy minister Macron. \n \nThe 39-year-old former investment banker, who quit the Socialist government last year to run for president as a centrist, has been drawing large crowds at his rallies and creeping up on Fillon and Le Pen in polls. \n \nHe is tipped for further gains if, as expected, Hamon wins the Socialist nod over Valls, with Socialist moderates turned off by Hamon\u2019s tax-and-spend programme expected to decamp to Macron. \n \nValls has said he will not support Hamon\u2019s programme if the latter wins. \n \nIf the tough-talking ex-premier emerges victorious, there could also be a flight from the Socialist camp. \n \nSome leftwingers have said they would shift their support to far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon, rather than back Valls. \n \nMelenchon is currently running in fourth in election polls. \n \n\u2013 \u2018The real Fillon\u2019 \u2013 \n \nHamon\u2019s ideas dominated the primary, particularly his proposal to introduce a universal basic income to offset dwindling work opportunities in an age of automation. \n \nValls argued that the plan for a handout that would eventually reach 750 euros a month would \u201cruin\u201d France and said a Hamon victory would spell \u201ccertain defeat\u201d for the Socialists in the presidential race. \n \nBoth Valls and Hamon have insisted that everything is still to play for. \n \nValls said Friday that Fillon\u2019s woes showed that the election \u201cwas not over\u201d. \n \nLe Pen told TF1 television Saturday that Fillon, who has pledged to quit the race if charged over his wife\u2019s payments, faced a \u201ctrust problem\u201d. \n \n\u201cThe French are rightfully asking themselves: who is the real Fillon? Is this not a man who likes money and who manoeuvred to enrich himself?\u201d she said. \n \nRead More At:   Article Source \n \nThe post appeared first on RocketNews |Top News Stories From Around the Globe .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"France news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Leftwinger, reformist duel for French Socialist presidential nod","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"CA","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"RocketNews","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669883","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"RocketNews","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.rocketnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://news.yahoo.com/leftwinger-reformist-duel-french-socialist-presidential-nod-050033569.html"],"sequenceId":"695198688743","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:02:26Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Seven days later, norms and doctrine that have guided the United States for decades are being re-examined. \n \nTrump\u2019s down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address: a call to arms that tested old distinctions between left and right. \n \n\u201cToday, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cWe are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.\u201d \n \nThe establishment \u201celites\u201d in big cities, in politics and the media were no longer the technocrats in charge of the world\u2019s only superpower, they were the enemy. \n \nThe new president also put the rest of the world on notice. \n \nFor the last 75 years, America had been what Barack Obama described as the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d \u2014 the glue that bound the global order. \n \nThe era of Trump would be the era of \u201cAmerica first,\u201d he said, of naked self-interest and zero-sum diplomacy. Old alliances would be reassessed, new alliances would be explored. \n \nBefore his inauguration, many asked if the presidency would change Donald Trump, or whether Donald Trump would change the presidency. \n \nBarely 20 minutes into his four-year term, anyone who was listening had their answer. \n \n\u2013 Rolling thunder \u2013 \n \nBefore arriving at the Oval Office, Trump\u2019s strategists had decided to use the first few weeks to unleash a daily wave of executive orders. \n \nThe aim was to unbalance opponents, define Trump as a man of action and slake his supporters\u2019 thirst for change. \n \nFor much of middle America, globalization, automation and the Great Recession had been apocalyptic. \n \nPolitics had passed them over and worse, they felt steamrollered by \u201ccoastal elites\u201d in America\u2019s \u201cculture wars\u201d over abortion, gay rights, immigration, global warming and religion. \n \nTrump had won the election by promising to be their champion, and he was going to \u2014 as Ronald Reagan said \u2014 \u201cdance with the one that brung ya.\u201d \n \nFor the most part, the CEO-in-chief put forward actions that could have come from any Republican in the country: defunding abortion, preening the military and approving oil pipelines. \n \nBut it was coated with a thick veneer of nationalist and populist rhetoric, and accompanying policies championed by top aide Steve Bannon. \n \nTrump ripped up a trans-Pacific trade deal designed to counterbalance China\u2019s regional economic power, imposed a ban on refugees from Syria and migrants from seven other Muslim countries. \n \nHe ordered planning to begin to build a wall on Mexico\u2019s southern border and picked a very public fight with Mexico\u2019s president Enrique Pena Nieto, who cancelled a trip to Washington. \n \nThe United States, a nation founded by migrants, was now willing to shut its doors. \n \nNot since Obama\u2019s election or perhaps the Iraq War has America\u2019s image around the world changed so dramatically and so quickly. \n \nBut Trump supporters saw an outsider sticking up for them and sticking it to the elites. \n \n\u201cGet used to it,\u201d said Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, boasting that Trump had delivered a \u201cshock to the system.\u201d \n \n\u201cAnd he\u2019s just getting started,\u201d she said. \n \n\u2013 Rocky start \u2013 \n \nBut it was not all positive for Trump. The White House is far from purring. Key positions have yet to be filled and the decision making process is haphazard. \n \nTrump aides were forced to publicly row back suggestions of a 20 percent border tax on Mexican goods and defend a chaotic rollout of the refugee and migrant ban. \n \nThroughout the week, Trump engaged in intemperate outbursts about the size of his inaugural crowd, alleged election fraud and perceived media persecution. \n \nPrivately, in call after call, he complained to top aides about press coverage. The impression was of a man focused on his image more than running the country. \n \nTrump also seemed like a a man for whom becoming US president was not adulation enough. \n \nSpokesman Sean Spicer \u2014 between tirades and missteps \u2014 offered a window onto the soul of the White House. \n  \n\u201cThere\u2019s this constant theme to undercut the enormous support he has,\u201d Spicer said. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably frustrating when you\u2019re continually told it\u2019s not big enough; it\u2019s not good enough. You can\u2019t win.\u201d \n \nAccording to a Quinnipiac poll, Trump\u2019s approval rating at the end of his first week stood at 36 percent. \n \nBut critics saw a more sinister motive for the outbursts, particularly Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that three million people voted illegally in the election. \n \nBrian Klaas, an expert on global democracy at the London School of Economics, sees Trump \u201ccasting aspersions (without evidence) on electoral integrity is a key way to restrict voting rights and erode confidence in elections.\u201d \n \n\u201cAttacking the media and blurring the lines of truth with state narratives not grounded in fact is important to sowing public doubt,\u201d he said. \n \nMindy Finn, who ran as a independent vice presidential candidate, summed up Trump\u2019s strategy as \u201csow chaos, deepen division and consolidate power.\u201d \n \nFor his harshest critics, the question is now whether Donald Trump breaks the presidency, or whether the presidency breaks Donald Trump. \n  \nRead More At:   Article Source \n \nThe post appeared first on RocketNews |Top News Stories From Around the Globe .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"In one week, Trump shakes up Washington and the world","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"CA","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"RocketNews","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669883","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"RocketNews","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.rocketnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://news.yahoo.com/one-week-trump-shakes-washington-world-062839474.html"],"sequenceId":"695198689256","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:28:39Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She was my biggest ally. She gave everything, she gave a tremendous, very complex performance,\u201d Villeneuve, 49, told AFP at the Producers Guild Awards (PGAs) in Beverly Hills. \n \nTaking its cue from classics such as \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d (1977) and \u201cContact\u201d (1997), \u201cArrival\u201d was filmed in Villeneuve\u2019s native Quebec for a relatively small $50 million. \n \nAdams, 42, was universally lauded for her portrayal of Louise Banks, a linguist enlisted by the army after alien pods pop up worldwide, to help figure out what their occupants want. \n \nThe picture pairs Adams with fellow \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d star Jeremy Renner, playing against type as a shy, soft-spoken mathematician. \n \nThe best actress Oscar nominations went to Emma Stone (\u201cLa La Land\u201d), Natalie Portman (\u201cJackie\u201d), Ruth Negga (\u201cLoving\u201d), Isabelle Huppert (\u201cElle\u201d) and Meryl Streep (\u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins\u201d). \n \nVilleneuve told AFP he had spoken to Adams several times since the nominations and that she had been nothing but magnanimous. \n \n\u201cAmy Adams is the incarnation of grace,\u201d said the director, who made \u201cSicario\u201d (2015) and has just finished filming the much-anticipated sequel to iconic sci-fi favorite \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d \n \n\u201cShe just said to me, \u2018Danny \u2014 it\u2019s all right. The movie is nominated, you are nominated, it\u2019s all good. Don\u2019t think about it, please just celebrate.'\u201d \n \n\u201cArrival\u201d was competing for best film at the PGAs alongside \u201cDeadpool,\u201d \u201cFences,\u201d \u201cHacksaw Ridge,\u201d \u201cHell or High Water,\u201d \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d \u201cLa La Land,\u201d \u201cLion,\u201d \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d and \u201cMoonlight.\u201d \n \n\u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d \u2014 which comes out in October, some 35 years after the cult neo-noir original \u2014 sees Harrison Ford reprising his role as Rick Deckard, this time opposite Ryan Gosling. \n \n\u201cIt was like the most powerful and intense cinematic experience of my life.

Are they still planning to kill Dhlakama?\u201d asked the 64-year-old rebel, who often speaks about himself in the third person. \n \n\u201cAre they trying to find the river where Dhlakama is drinking from to poison it, or the roads we use to plant anti-personnel landmines?\u201d \n \nDhlakama, whose Renamo party is the main opposition in Mozambique, retreated in October 2012 to his hideout in Gorongosa with 800 former guerrillas demanding a greater share of power. \n \nIn 2013 tensions resurfaced with Renamo fighters again taking up arms against Frelimo, accusing the ruling party of enriching itself at the expense of the southern African country. \n \nOn the eve of the October 2014 general elections Renamo and the government signed a ceasefire. \n \nBut Renamo refused to accept the results of the 2014 elections when it was beaten once more at the polls by Frelimo, which has been in power since the former Portuguese colony\u2019s independence 40 years ago \n \n\u2013 \u2018Won\u2019t give up on truce\u2019 \u2013 \n \nDhlakama has accused the army of not only targeting Renamo members but civilians too. \n \n\u201cThe armed forces go to the villages, open fire to disperse the population, and then ransack the houses making off with chickens and goats, which is typical of Frelimo,\u201d he claimed, adding that women had been beaten and houses torched. \n \n\u201cEither Frelimo does not know how to control its troops or there is a clear lack of will,\u201d he said. \n \nAbuses have also been reported to international organisations by Mozambicans who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries. \n \nAuthorities in December said more than 3,000 people fleeing the conflict now live in government camps, while the UN refugee agency says another 8,600 have been forced to cross the border to Malawi and Zimbabwe. \n \nIn spite of the allegations, Dhlakama has no intention of calling off the ceasefire, which he admits he unilaterally proclaimed in a bid to reopen peace negotiations. \n \nThe peace talks with international mediators resumed in May last year but failed to prevent the escalation of tensions and by mid-December the mediators quit the country. \n \n\u201cI must speak to President Nyusi in the coming days because we are still waiting for him to give the signal for the return of mediators,\u201d said Dhlakama. \n \nThe rebel leader said he will leave his mountain base only to sign a peace agreement. \n \n\u201cWe are not going to give up on the truce. But every day someone calls me up to ask me to extend it beyond March 4. And I always tell them that it will depend on the progress of the negotiations.\u201d \n \nRead More At:   Article Source \n \nThe post appeared first on RocketNews |Top News Stories From Around the Globe .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Mozambique news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Mozambique rebel leader accuses soldiers of violating ceasefire","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"CA","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"RocketNews","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669883","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"RocketNews","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.rocketnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://news.yahoo.com/mozambique-rebel-leader-accuses-soldiers-violating-ceasefire-063444587.html"],"sequenceId":"695198689995","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:34:44Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.rocketnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/s.yimg_.comuuapires1.2kYbpV1EWCK50atqENnStbw-aD02ODE7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-httpmedia.zenfs_.comen_usNewsafp.comPart-PAR-Par8003185-1-1-0-91249688dec374b65cf70680f7fc20aa39214921-1.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

(Photo: Submitted) \n  \nThe Seaholm High School band recently returned from taking a group of 130 students, staff and chaperones to Rome for a week. \n \nThe highlight of the trip was the band marching in the Rome New Year's Day Parade, along with several other high school and college bands from the U.S., in front of a crowd that was estimated at 50,000 people. \n \nThe band also had the opportunity to perform in the small hilltop town of Frascati,12 miles outside of Rome. One of the interesting aspects of the Frascati performance, band leaders said, was they met two Seaholm alumni (one from the 1950s and the other from the 1970s) who lived in nearby towns and came out to see the performance. \n \nIn addition to their performances, students had the opportunity to experience many of the amazing historical treasures in Rome and the surrounding areas, including the Colosseum, Forum, Circus Maximus, Pantheon, Vatican City and Pompei. Band leaders said they had \"a great time on the trip and were outstanding representatives of our community.\" \n Roeper gala  \nThe Roeper School is celebrating its 75th anniversary with a Gala & Golden Apple Awards Ceremony at 7 p.m. Friday, Feb. 17, at the Royal Oak Music Theater. Founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, lawyer and best-selling author Bryan Stevenson will be presented an award and will be the keynote speaker. In his critically acclaimed memoir, \"Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption,\" Stevenson writes about the many cases in which he challenged bias against the poor, minorities and children in the criminal justice system. His book will be on sale at the gala, with an opportunity for signing. Stevenson will visit Roeper to meet with students the morning of the gala to inspire and to share his message. \n \nAlso being honored are Shamayim \u201cMama Shu\u201d Harris, Sally Booth and Rudy Simons. Ellen DeGeneres referred to Mama Shu as \u201cthe Amazing Mama Shu\u201d who is rebuilding her blighted Highland Park neighborhood into a community to be proud of \u201chouse by house\u201d. Booth, now in her 90s played an integral role in the school\u2019s early beginnings, assisting founder Annemarie Roeper. Simons, a Roeper alum parent, is a well-known Detroit human rights activist, was a board member of both the Michigan Coalition for Human Rights and the Center for Peace and Conflict Studies at Wayne State University as well as a member of many international peace delegations. \n \nThe Roeper Gala & Golden Apple Awards tradition began in 1990 to commemorate the school\u2019s 50th anniversary and to honor individuals who embodied the school\u2019s founding principle: each of us should strive to fulfill our potential and use our gifts to better the community. Previous awardees include Maya Angelou, David Brinkley, James Earl Jones, Rosa Parks and Arun Gandhi.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect.

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nassau","zipCode":"11530","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Garden City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"New Hyde Park Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172081230","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"New Hyde Park Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newhydepark.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695198707804","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:53:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22877259/20170128/091105/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1485654598-9499.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WesternTimes.com.au","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"606907614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"WesternTimes.com.au","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.westerntimes.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198711284","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T14:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557687z1_20170129162619_000g9dg4eu82-0-5o7dbx25uooe6wninn2_t325x200.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

woman in the Hunter has global vision for region. \n\nTHE state government\u2019s fresh face in the Hunter has declared she wants to end Novocastrian \u201cnegativity\u201d, vowing to be the \u201cbest friend\u201d of anyone who wants to sell the region\u2019s story on the world stage.\n\nIn a running start to her new job, incoming Parliamentary Secretary for the Hunter Catherine Cusack also said outstanding council amalgamations were a \u201chandbrake\u201d on the region\u2019s growth; the Williamtown contamination crisis needed \u201curgent attention\u201d from the federal government; and Newcastle\u2019s \u201crebellious spirit\u201d demanded respect.\n\nMs Cusack will become NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s highest representative in the Hunter, replacing Scot MacDonald who shifts to Parliamentary Secretary for Planning and the Central Coast.\n\nIn a cabinet reshuffle announced on Sunday, several former Baird Government heavy-hitters were dumped, including Adrian Piccoli, who had education, and Duncan Gay, who had the roads portfolio.\n\nMr Piccoli was replaced in education by Pittwater MP Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by Lane Cove MP and former energy minister Anthony Roberts. \n\nAndrew Constance will continue to oversee the Newcastle light rail project as transport minister.\n\nMs Cusack said she was \u201cso excited\u201d for her new role, and indulged that she had already come to know the region through her mentor, firebrand former education minister, the late Virginia Chadwick, who was born in Newcastle.\n\n\u201cShe always felt that Newcastle had enormous potential that needed to be released,\u201d Ms Cusack said. \u201cIt\u2019s a world-class city that can stand on its own two feet.\u201d\n\nMr MacDonald, who used a crying emoji on Twitter after the announcement, said he was \u201csorry\u201d to lose responsibility for the Hunter.\n\n\u201cIt has been the most challenging and exciting role of my political career,\u201d he said.\n\nMs Cusack, who is based in Lennox Head, said she would promote the government\u2019s urban renewal projects in the Hunter to the world.\n\n\u201cThe question shouldn\u2019t be what do I see as the Hunter\u2019s role in the state \u2013 it should be what is the Hunter\u2019s role in the world?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be the best friend of anyone who promotes that positive message.\u201d\n\nDeclaring the region demanded respect from its politicians, she said pending Hunter council mergers needed to be decided. \n\n\u201cThe sooner that\u2019s resolved, the better,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Cusack said to have large swathes of the Hunter in \u201cuproar\u201d over the Williamtown contamination crisis was a disgrace. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m dying to get to the bottom of that issue,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Cusack, who planned to visit the region this week, would not elaborate on what federal government assistance was required until she met with residents.\n\nOpposition Leader Luke Foley criticised the pick and said the Hunter had again been \u201coverlooked\u201d for ministerial status. \n\n\u201c[Ms Berejiklian] saw fit to add in any number of spurious new ministries to ensure that every boy and girl in the Liberal Party room got a prize but clearly appointing a minister for the Hunter wasn't a priority,\u201d Mr Foley said. \n\nMeanwhile, Mr MacDonald talked up the Hunter\u2019s economic credentials.\n\n\u200b\u201cit\u2019s a huge region that comes with a lot of responsibilities,\u201d Mr MacDonald said. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that if the Hunter\u2019s performing well, the rest of the state is performing well.\u201d\n\nThe MP was in the role while the government made a number of contentious decisions, including the truncation of the heavy rail line and light rail down Hunter Street. \n\nMr MacDonald\u2019s advice for Ms Cusack was to press the flesh with as many people in the Hunter as possible. \n\nAnd in a parting jab at his political rivals, he challenged Hunter Labor MPs to stop being \u201cprotest representatives\u201d. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to oppose something without coming up with solutions of your own,\u201d he said. \n\nPort Stephens MP Kate Washington said she hoped Ms Cusack was \u201cbetter\u201d than Mr MacDonald.\n\n\u201dAs Shadow Minister for the Hunter and the Member for Port Stephens, I look forward to working with Catherine and trust that she will be willing to engage with the local Hunter MP's, unlike her predecessor,\u201d she said.\n\nThe new cabinet will be sworn in on Monday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Brodie Owen@Brodie_Owen"},"topics":[{"name":"Australia

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 18 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Norfolk","zipCode":"02494","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Needham Heights","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WCVB.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"352601084","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"415"},"name":"WCVB.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wcvb.com","publisher":"Hearst Television, Inc."},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198715981","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Though nothing came out of the trip, Trump later praised Gorbachev for \"opening up the country.\" \n\n\"As a shrewd businessman, he saw an untapped market in the Soviet Union,\" said Boris Zilberman, a Russia expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington. \"He was looking for an opportunity to capitalize on, but it never materialized.\" \n\nDissolution of Soviet Union \n\nBut other opportunities would soon appear on the horizon as the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 ushered in a wave of privatization of lucrative state-owned assets under former President Boris Yeltsin. Western investors flocked in for a piece of the action. Trump got on the bandwagon, albeit tentatively, and some say too late. \n\nIn 1996, Trump made his second trip to Moscow, carrying a proposal to build a luxury complex on property owned by U.S. tobacco company Liggett-Ducat. He praised the city's development potential and trademarked his brand in keeping with a practice of registering his name in anticipation of developing a project. \n\nAt least seven other trademark registrations followed over the next decade, but none led to an actual development. \n\nWhy Trump, the consummate dealmaker who survived multiple bankruptcies and built a global brand, failed to secure any major deals in Russia remains a mystery. \n\nOne explanation is Trump grew increasingly leery of doing deals in Russia as organized crime flourished, oligarchs seized power and the business environment increasingly appeared unregulated. Indeed, in 1999, he pronounced Russia a country \"out of control\" and described its ailing leader as \"a disaster.\" \n\nBut Witlin, of the Eurasia Group, offers another reason: Trump's lack of well-connected local partners. \n\n\"In the 1990s and even today, in order to navigate in Russia, it helps a lot to have a local partner who understands the local market, knows the rules of the game, and knows the actors,\" Witlin said. \"He just didn't have the connections.\" \n\nBut when Trump found the right partner, success found him quickly. Case in point: Aras Agalarov, an Azerbaijan-born billionaire real estate developer with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n\nIn 2013, Trump, then a co-owner of the Miss Universe beauty pageant, signed a $20 million deal with Agalarov to host the pageant in his Crocus concert hall in Moscow. \n\nTo bring Miss Universe to Moscow, Trump \"had the right partner,\" Witlin said. \n\nTentative deal \n\nPutin did not show for the pageant, despite Trump's Twitter enticements, but it earned Trump publicity and a tentative deal with Agalarov to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. But in a reprise of past efforts, the project did not go forward, as the Trump Organization turned its attention elsewhere and Trump began to mull a run for the White House. \n\nDespite his failure to build a hotel in Russia or to license his name to Russian property developers, Trump had greater success in getting Russian investors, large and small, to invest in his developments in the U.S. \n\nIn 2006, he partnered with Bayrock Group, a New York-based real estate company founded by Soviet emigres, to develop the $450 million Trump Soho hotel condominium project. All the while, Russian investors, looking for safe investment opportunities, began snapping up Trump condos in New York and Florida. \n\nWhile describing Russia as a difficult business environment, Trump's son Donald Jr. touted Russian investment thirst for Trump properties. \n\n\"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets,\" Donald Trump Jr. told a real estate conference in 2008. \"We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\" \n\nTo insulate himself against conflicts of interest while in office, President Trump recently handed control of his business empire to sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. Under an arrangement announced before inauguration, he also vowed that his company would be making no deals while he's in the White House. \n\nNevertheless, experts say Trump will find it hard to shake charges of conflicts of interest, even though he has no business interest in Russia. \n\n\"I think given the extent to which that idea has been so discussed, popularized and has become an issue of concern for a large swath of the public, it would be difficult to shake off that impression no matter what happens there,\" Witlin said. \n\nShare this article: \n\nFeatured Story \n\nAfghanistan's Defense Ministry says it wants to raise the number of women serving in the Afghan National Army to a level where women comprise 10 percent of the force. \n\nDefense Ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanesh said on January 27 that the government had set several measures, including a special salary scale for female recruits, to encourage more women to join up. \n\n'At this stage, we have 1,575 Afghan women in our army ranks, it is a mere 3 to 4 percent -- which is nothing,' Radmanesh said.

Within 24 hours, I canceled the flight. My son spoke to American on the phone, and was told that the refund would be credited to my credit card \"soon.\" \n\nIt's been more than a month. My credit-card payment is due in three days, and the charge still shows as \"pending review.\" Can you help? \n\n\u2014 Sampath Radhakrishna, Cupertino, Calif. \n\nA: Your son's reservation fell under the \"24-hour rule,\" which says that if you cancel an airline ticket within a day of making the reservation, you're entitled to a full and prompt refund. (Certain restrictions apply for last-minute tickets.) \n\nHow prompt? Well, that's the problem. When a refund is due, the airline must forward a credit to your card company within seven business days after receiving a complete refund application, according to the Department of Transportation. But the credit may take a month or two to appear on your statement. \n\nYour son was at about the one-month mark. He'd been left with the impression that the refund would be issued \"soon,\" and had interpreted that as \"less than a month.\" In fact, American would have been well within its rights to wait two months before returning the money. \n\nLet's pause for a moment to consider the absurdity of this situation. An airline is allowed to keep your money for two months \u2014 can you say \"interest-free loan\"? \u2014 while the rest of us must pay our bills promptly. Oh, and how long does it take American to withdraw the money from your account? Seconds. \n\nSomething just isn't right with this. American should have returned the money \u2014 in seconds. \n\nThis isn't an American Airlines problem, or even an airline problem. Corporate America creates rules in its favor that allow it to benefit from holding on to your money for a few extra weeks. I've asked executives about the sluggish refund process, and they've told me, with a straight face, that the problem is exacerbated by credit-card billing cycles and overly cautious accounting processes. I think that's nonsense. If they benefited from speedy refunds, they would have figured out a way to send you the money instantly. But they have no motive, so here we are. \n\nA brief, polite email to one of American's customer-service executives might have shaken a check loose from the accounting department. I list their names, numbers and emails on my consumer-advocacy site: http://elliott.org/company-contacts/American. \n\nI contacted American, and it informed me that your refund has been processed \u2014 hopefully in time for you to avoid paying a big credit-card bill. \n\nChristopher Elliott is the ombudsman for National Geographic Traveler magazine and the author of \"How to Be the World's Smartest Traveler.\" You can read more travel tips on his blog, www.elliott.org, or email him at chris@elliott.org. \n\nRELATED STORIES: \n\nCruise News 2017: New ships, where to go, when to buy","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Christopher Elliott"},"topics":[],"title":"Why wont American Airlines refund my sons airfare?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cook","zipCode":"60654","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Chicago","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Chicago Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587602","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Chicago Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["TravelTourism","Recreation","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.chicagotribune.com","publisher":"Tribune Company"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://elliott.org/company-contacts/American"],"sequenceId":"695198725021","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

With India being the 3rd largest investor into the UK, these awards are all about finding the future investors, and exposing them to the benefits of globalising via the UK. \n\nThe competition has enabled India's top young entrepreneurs to raise their profile with UK and Indian investors, incubators and business hubs. Some of the winners have already received significant angel funding from businesses and venture capitalists. \n\nAmo Kalar, Deputy Director Investment said: \"We are incredibly proud and excited that our superstar TECH Rocketship winners will now get to experience their 'grand prize'- a trip to the UK to experience what the world's foremost business destination has to offer. The trip has been designed to put them right alongside pioneers within the UK technology and start-up scene, from incubators to funder with funders thrown in for good measure. \n\nI know they will make the most of this once-in-a-lifetime chance to visit London, the world's best place to set up a digital business, but also Scotland and Bristol too. I know they will make the very most of time spent with DIT's experts and leading professional services firms who will give them the very best advice on internationalizing their business through the UK. I wish them the very best, and hope they get to experience the sights and sounds of the UK too. Who knows which big-ticket break can be round the corner!\" \n\nThis is the third year of the TECH Rocketship Awards, launched by Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in Mumbai in April 2016. This is the first year of the Dev Tech Awards launched in September 2016, to recognise entrepreneurs who create innovative tech-based solutions that benefit India's poor and create a positive impact in a number of areas, including in education and agriculture. The winners of both awards were announced at the India - UK TECH Summit, inaugurated by the British and Indian Prime Ministers in November 2016. Both the awards are looking to position the best Indian companies, with the most scalable and international-ready technologies, in front of UK and Indian Venture Capitalists, Angel investors, and also putting top UK service providers before these Indian companies. \n\nIndian Angel Network (IAN) has closely worked with DIT to shortlist the applications and has invested in businesses of two of the winners. \n\nSaurabh Srivastava, Co-founder and Director of IAN said: \"The Indian start-up ecosystem has witnessed a significant growth in the last few years, strengthening its position as the third largest ecosystem in the world. The TECH Rocketship Awards focuses on applauding new talents that have emerged as a game changer. Indian start-ups are breeding world class innovation catering to global markets. DIT partnered with this Indian hotbed of innovation and entrepreneurship with IAN to build the start-up bridge between India and UK. This brings the best of \n\nboth countries together and helps create a global footprint for companies. IAN applauds TRA to be the key platform to enable this bridge.\" \n\nIndia is already the third largest investor in the UK and 50% of Indian investments into the UK are in the Tech sector, totalling \n\n136 million. Indian companies have also emerged as the second largest job creators in the UK creating 7,105 through 140 projects. The UK provides an excellent platform for Indian companies to grow their businesses overseas, with world leading financial and professional services and an advanced tec \n\nhnology sector.

I always am intrigued when I study the question and try to determine what I feel the Scripture is saying. I received an interesting one this past week: \u201cWhat does it mean in the Book of Matthew when we are told to shake the dust off of our feet?\u201d \n \nThe first place I find the verse is Matthew 10:14, but I was surprised to find it listed several different times in the New Testament. I have found in past study that when the Lord told us something, He always means it, but when He wants to put unusual emphasis on it, He will repeat it and sometimes rephrase it, giving us multiple illustrations. The command also appears in Luke 9:5, and in the Matthew 10 account, Jesus clarifies His meaning. It is also mentioned again in Mark 6:11. \n \nIn each case, the command is spoken by Jesus to His disciples when He sent them out two by two to witness for Him. In Mark 6:11, we read, \u201cAnd if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, leave that place and shake the dust off of your feet as a testimony against them.\u201d In the Matthew 10 rendering, He added, \u201cTruly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the Day of Judgment than for that town (Verse 15). \n \nSeveral scholars I have read said that the shaking the dust off reference is somewhat akin to our more modern phrase of, \u201cI have done what I could. I wash my hands of it.\u201d Shaking the dust off the feet is a symbolic indication that one has done all that can be done in a situation and therefore carries no further responsibility for it. In the scriptural examples we read, Jesus was telling His disciples that they were to preach the gospel to everyone. Where they were received with joy, they should stay and teach. But where the message was rejected, they had no further responsibility. They could walk away with a clear conscious knowing they had done all that they could do in the circumstances that were prevailing. In many cases, the shaking off of the dust has a finality to it that indicates the case is closed. \n \nI only remember one time in my younger days of Christian training where I heard that verse quoted and put into practice. Later in my life, I have two clear remembrances of having to shake the dust off of my own feet and moving on to other projects. If we stand firm in our beliefs, reach out to others, go the extra mile, help where we can, and the person to whom we are reaching out refuses to hear or change, we are free to move on. Of course, we can still pray for that individual and certainly hope that he or she will come to salvation, repentance or right living. \n \nI have learned over the years that we are responsible for our obedience to God and His word, but we are not responsible for the results of that obedience. There are times when we cannot do any more. We must shake the dust off of our feet and move on to other work and other people. \n \nWhen this truth hurts the most, in my way of thinking, is when we love that individual or family member, co-worker, neighbor, classmate or friend with a genuine, heartfelt love. We want to see him change for the good of himself, his family, his friends and his community. However, if his actions continually hurt others and eventually, wreck and ruin his own life, it is sad and causes pain to all concerned. We leave our contact knowing that God can and often will reach this person. Our work is done, and we move on to others. \n \nGod help each of us to search our hearts at the beginning of this new year to determine if there are people in our lives that are hurtful, unforgiving, do not intend to change, and who we should leave in the past. We want to be loving and kind, but there are times when that is not enough. I have heard all of my life that as long as there is breath, there is hope, and I do believe that, but it may not include us in the equation. God bless us in 2017 as we serve Him and others. \n \nBrenda Cannon Henley can be reached at (409) 781-8788 or at brendacannonhenley [at] yahoo [dot] com .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Brenda Cannon Henley"},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Choosing to shake the dust off your feet","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"77701","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Beaumont","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Examiner Southeast Texas","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"544933041","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Examiner Southeast Texas","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theexaminer.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198734658","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

Just this past week, the Dodgers front office concluded their winter-long search for a second baseman when they traded for Logan Forsythe.\n\nThat leaves just one thing to worry about \u2013 and it\u2019s the same thing Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman says always worries him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you ever get to a place with the bullpen where you feel like you\u2019re done,\u201d Friedman said Saturday at Dodger Stadium. \u201cIt\u2019s something that every year, heading into the season, it scares me. \u2026 It\u2019s obviously a very tricky part of roster construction.\u201d\n\nFriedman joked that the seasons when he was most worried about the bullpen usually turned out to be the years when his bullpen performed best \u2013 and vice versa.\n\nEven if an \u2018under construction\u2019 sign remains permanently fixed to any bullpen in Friedman\u2019s mind, the Dodgers\u2019 current relief corps looks to be largely settled with spring training just more than two weeks away.\n\nGM Farhan Zaidi offered that there are \u201csome interesting guys still out there\u201d on the free-agent market. But the relievers in that group \u2013 veterans such as Joe Smith, Fernando Salas and Sergio Romo \u2013 appear to hold little interest for the Dodgers. Veteran Joe Blanton, who surprisingly emerged as the Dodgers\u2019 most reliable setup man last season, remains unsigned as well and \u201cit\u2019s not lost on us what a significant part of our bullpen he was last season,\u201d Friedman said.\n\nBut that successful 2016 (a 2.48 ERA and 1.01 WHIP in a team-high 75 appearances) might have pushed the 36-year-old Blanton\u2019s market beyond what the Dodgers are willing to pay after extending themselves farther than expected (a combined $192 million) to re-sign Jansen, Turner and Hill. The same financial restraint has probably kept the Dodgers from bidding aggressively for other bullpen options.\n\n\u201cObviously we committed significant resources (to re-signing in-house free agents),\u201d Friedman said. \u201cI think it impacts everywhere, just how you allocate. It obviously has trickle-down effects.\u201d\n\nZaidi pointed out that the Dodgers bullpen performed \u201cat the top of baseball\u201d last year and can look forward to full seasons from players such as Josh Fields and Grant Dayton, who emerged as key pieces late in the year. The only additions to last year\u2019s group figure to be of the type already signed \u2013 former Tampa Bay Ray Steve Geltz and former San Diego Padre Brandon Morrow, both of whom signed minor-league contracts with non-roster invitations to spring training.\n\n\u201cI think the arms are there,\u201d said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who made a major-league record 606 pitching changes in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a situation where somebody\u2019s gotta emerge, sort of what Joe Blanton did for us last year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of options. It\u2019s more about who\u2019s going to step up and pitch those innings.\u201d\n\nWEIGHTY MATTERS \n\nOutfielder Yasiel Puig lifted his shirt onstage to show the crowd at Dodger Stadium for Saturday\u2019s FanFest how well he is doing in satisfying the Dodgers\u2019 request for him to get leaner in 2017. Puig has hired a nutritionist and a chef, Roberts said \u2013 though they didn\u2019t appear to be part of the entourage throwing \u201cYP\u201d logo hats to the crowd as Puig made his FanFest appearance.\n\nCatcher Yasmani Grandal, meanwhile, has cut meat from his diet this winter and expects to report to spring training 10 pounds below his usual playing weight and 20 pounds lower than he normally starts spring training. Grandal said he is \u201ca little worried\u201d about being too light and will probably add meat back into his diet this spring.\n\nFitness and diet aren\u2019t the only issues for Puig this season as he tries to bounce back from a disappointing 2016 that included a month-long demotion to Triple-A and attempts by the Dodgers to trade him.\n\n\u201cIt was not a good experience going to Triple-A,\u201d Puig said, conducting his interview in English. \u201cBut that was my fault \u2013 coming in late, not going to meetings on time with my teammates and coaches. That was the reason.\u201d\n\nRoberts said he has spoken with Puig multiple times during the winter and \u201che\u2019s in a great state of mind right now.\u201d\n\nALSO \n\nUtilityman Kiké Hernandez plans to play for Puerto Rico in the World Baseball Classic. Outfielder Joc Pederson, however, said he turned down an invitation to play for Team Israel. As a minor leaguer four years ago, Pederson was the youngest player on Team Israel during the qualifying rounds for the WBC. \u2026 Roberts said 20-year-old left-hander Julio Urias will definitely have an innings limit in 2017 \u2013 \u201che is still a young man.\u201d Roberts has mentioned the possibility that Urias will stay behind in Arizona for extended spring training after the Dodgers break camp as a way to save those innings for later in the year. \u201cIt\u2019s a team decision,\u201d Urias said through an interpreter. \u201cI\u2019m just going to get ready and wait for their decision. I\u2019ll respect it whatever it is.\u201d \u2026 Friedman said he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about reports that Hyun-Jin Ryu has already been throwing off a mound. If Ryu can make a comeback from shoulder and elbow surgeries that limited him to one start in the past two years \u201cit would be a real boon to us,\u201d Friedman said.\n\nContact the writer: bplunkett@scng.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BILL PLUNKETT"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Bullpen remains Dodgers brass' big worry","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Riverside","zipCode":"92501","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Riverside","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Riverside Press Enterprise","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667020","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Riverside Press Enterprise","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pe.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://pe.subscriberconcierge.com/subscriptionpanel?pid=22"],"sequenceId":"695198736689","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/okivsm-b88886096z.120170128194339000g4uld30r.10.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Keelan's fastest previous mile was 4:06.25, run indoors in 2015. \n\nA specialist at the longer distances \u2013 he was fourth in the Pac-12 10,000 meters last spring \u2013 Keelan proved he has speed. He ran a sub-4 1,600 split to anchor the distance medley relay on Friday and returned 20 hours later to run the invitational mile. \n\nKeelan tucked into fourth place on the opening laps as Penn State's Brad Rivera acted as a pacesetter, and slipped into third when Rivera stepped off the track. With the pace even at about 30 seconds per lap, Keelan passed Binghamton's Eric Holt with just over two laps to go, and crept onto the heels of Penn State alum Robbie Creese, the 2015 Big Ten indoor mile champ. \n\nKeelan tried to make a move on the penultimate backstretch and went outside on the final turn. Though Creese held him off briefly, Keelan continued to grind and passed Creese in the final 10 meters to win. \n\nKeelan becomes the fourth on the Stanford team to run sub-4, joining Sean McGorty , Tom Coyle , and Grant Fisher . He also is No. 4 on Stanford's all-time indoor performer's list for a regulation, or non-oversized track. \n\nStanford also was involved in another close race, finishing second in the women's 4x400 relay. The Cardinal team of Gaby Gayles , Michaela Crunkleton Wilson , Hannah Labrie-Smith , and Olivia Baker was second to Maryland, 3:40.17 to 3:40.29. \n\nGayles staked Stanford to a lead and Crunkleton Wilson extended it. Labrie-Smith handed off with about three meters to spare over a closing Maryland. Micha Powell, a Canadian Olympian, passed Baker early, but Baker stayed tough and was side-by-side with Powell down the stretch. \n\nPenn State National Open \nAt Horace Ashenfelter III Indoor Track \n(200 meters, banked) \n\nMen \n800 \u2013 1, Domenic Perretta (Penn State) 1:50.33; 3, Isaac Cortes (Stanford) 1:51.86; 4, Brian Smith (Stanford) 1:52.04. \nMile \u2013 1, Jack Keelan (Stanford) 3:59.62. \n\nWomen \n800 \u2013 1, Jasmine Staebler (Iowa State) 2:04.81; 2, Elise Cranny (Stanford) 2:05.51; 3, Rebecca Mehra (Stanford) 2:05.81; 4, Malika Waschmann (Stanford) 2:08.22. \n4x400 \u2013 1, Maryland 3:40.17; 2, Stanford ( Gaby Gayles , Michaela Crunkleton Wilson , Hannah Labrie-Smith , Olivia Baker ) 3:40.29. \n  \n\n* * * \n \nSEATTLE \u2013  Amber Lewis broke two personal records in the same event and finished the day at No. 8 on Stanford's all-time indoor performers' list in the 60-meter hurdles after her performance at the UW Invitational. \nLewis, a junior, came in with an 8.89 best and nearly equaled it with a qualifying round 8.90. She surpassed that with each round, running 8.77 in the prelims and 8.70 to finish sixth in the final. \n\nStanford junior Tristen Newman set his second PR in as many meets in the 35-pound weight throw. His toss of 60-10 (18.54 meters) was good for second and broke his two-week old PR of 60-0 ½ (18.30), set on the same Dempsey Indoor ring. \n\nNewman has improved by two feet this season and moved up a spot to No. 8 on Stanford's all-time performers' list. \n\nOn the 307-meter track, several Stanford freshmen excelled while running unattached during redshirt seasons. \n\nChristina Aragon and Fiona O'Keeffe , cross country All-Americans for the Cardinal last fall, placed second and fifth in the 3,000, running 9:12.58 and 9:15.51. They would have been the Nos. 4-5 in Stanford freshman history if wearing Cardinal uniforms. In the mile, Ella Donaghu was sixth in a strong field in 4:42.81. \n\nIn the men's 3,000, Pac-12 Cross Country Freshman of the Year Thomas Ratcliffe placed fifth in 7:53.23 while also running unattached. \n\nUW Invitational \nAt Dempsey Indoor \n(307 meters, flat) \n\nMen \n60 \u2013 Final: 7, Isaiah Brandt-Sims (Stanford) 6.90.

If you don\u2019t smoke, don\u2019t start,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cThe fundamental question is to compare e-cigarettes to combustibles. The fact is, they are less harmful than combustibles.\u201d \n \nThe health claim \n \nA central claim, echoed by the pro-vaping speakers at this week\u2019s event and repeated in leaflets handed out by the VPA, is that \ne-cigarettes are \u201c95% safer\u201d than tobacco. \n \nThis contentious statistic stems from a modelling exercise published in 2014, and has sparked debate worldwide. \n \nAt this week\u2019s event, Bates attributed this percentage to the \u201cconsensus of top physicians\u201d. \n \nLetlape was a co-author of this estimate and the work was funded by a company tied to Human, according to a critical article in the British Medical Journal. \n \nThe research does not actually say that e-cigarettes are 95% safer than cigarettes \u2013 at least, not in the way that most people would interpret this statement. \n \nThe \u201charm\u201d estimated includes harm to other people and problems not directly related to the health effects of cigarettes. \n \nThe same paper, for instance, indicates that tobacco cigars are 85% \u201cless harmful\u201d than cigarettes, while small cigars are 35% less harmful. \n \nThe ratings of these products as more or less harmful are the sole opinion of the experts involved, notes another recent criticism in the Journal of Lung, Pulmonary and Respiratory Research. \n \nDespite the huge uncertainties about e-cigarettes, even critics admit that they are almost certainly less harmful than tobacco cigarettes. \n \n\u201cNo matter what anyone says, you will not know what vaping does for 30 years,\u201d said Van Zyl-Smit, adding that the 95% safer claim was \u201cfar from a proven fact\u201d. \n \n\u201cIt is very likely that e-cigarettes are better than tobacco. It is exceptionally unlikely that they are worse,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cI would be astounded [to discover] they were not safer. The debate is around how much better they are,\u201d he told City Press. \n \n\u201cBeing safer than cigarettes is not hard. Even if e-cigarettes only killed every third user, they would still be safer than tobacco.\u201d \n \nHe was quick to add that the notion of safe was relative. \n \n\u201cIf I develop a blood pressure medicine that someone will take for 20 years, I have no tolerance for any safety risk,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cBut if I am developing a short-term treatment for terminal cancer, my tolerance for risk is very different.\u201d \n Read  Fin24's top stories  trending on Twitter:  Fin24\u2019s top stories","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Dewald van Rensburg"},"topics":[{"name":"Tobacco industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"South Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Vaping vs tobacco: a smokin\u2019 hot issue","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Fin24.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"582050672","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4589"},"name":"Fin24.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Financials","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fin24.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198758583","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:21:08Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/fin24.png"}],"video":[]}}

These marks are set at 60% and above. \n \nVery few obtain a minimum score of 50% and above. \n \nIn 2017, we will continue to offer matriculants supplementary classes in these subjects to increase their chances of passing them with the required marks. \n \nWe also anticipate that Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga\u2019s new national Stem unit will address the problem and contribute solutions. \n \nIt is evident that the IDC\u2019s contribution to these schools is yielding positive results. \n \nAll pupils benefit from the supplementary classes and support from the IDC is intended to give these poor pupils a chance to succeed. \n \nIt will take teamwork among all stakeholders to beef up our education system and the IDC appreciates the support it has received from the national and provincial departments of basic education, as well as parents, school managers and pupils. \n \nLuthuli is the IDC\u2019s divisional executive of corporate affairs \n \nTALK TO US \n \nDo you have any suggestions for improving matriculants\u2019 university entry marks? \n \nSMS us on 35697 using the keyword LEARNERS and tell us what you think.

It helped because they believed in me,\u201d says Nemavhadwe. \n \nThe first year acturial science student at Wits University in Johannesburg says her message to the class of 2017 is that \u201cnormal school time is enough to cover the basics but if you want to excel and aim for a perfect score you must take the supplementary classes seriously even if it means compromising on your own leisure time\u201d. \n \nThe no-fee paying school, in a deep rural part of the province, is among 20 across the country adopted by the state\u2019s developmental finance institution, the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), through its Whole School Development Programme. \n \n\u201cAs teachers we work as a team and family,\u201d says Maselesele, adding that \u201cour boss is the learner\u201d. \n \n\u201cNo one can beat that and we are here because of this learner,\u201d he says. \n \nHe says his staff appreciates that it is important to keep the pupil enrolment in the school high \u2013 currently standing at 2 375 pupils with an average of 70 pupils in one class. \n \n\u201cOnce learner enrolment increases, the department will also increase the number of teachers,\u201d says Maselesele. \n \n\u201cSo, I motivate my teachers and tell them that while parents still have that positive attitude towards us, let us work for these kids.\u201d \n \nHe says the school also has a policy that teachers should \u201cideally\u201d have their children attending Tshivhase. Citing himself as an example, he says \u201cthree of my children are matriculating here\u201d. \n \n\u201cMy last-born is in primary school, but I believe he is also going to come here,\u201d says Maselesele. \n \n\u201cIf you send your kids to another school and you teach here, what are you saying? You may be sending the wrong message,\u201d he says. \n \n\u201cSo, the policy that we have adopted is that we should try our level best to have our kids attending school here. And my teachers are doing that.\u201d \n \nAt around 11am, says Maselesele, more than 30 of the teachers were expected to attend a meeting of the SA Democratic Teachers\u2019 Union. But he says a teachers\u2019 meeting does not mean that school is out. \n \n\u201cIn other schools when teachers attend the meeting it is the end of the school day. But it is a teachers\u2019 meeting and not a learners\u2019 meeting. So our learners know that they will go home at the normal time,\u201d he says. \n \n\u201cThe first group of learners leave at 3.30pm and Grade 12s at 5pm.\u201d \n \nExplaining the school\u2019s drop from position three in the province in 2015 to position six at the end of last year, Maselesele says the issue of progressive pupils contributed. \n \nThese are students who were promoted to Grade 12 without passing Grade 11. \n \nOnly nine of the 20 promoted students managed to pass. \n \nThe school\u2019s mathematics pass rate also dropped from 71% in 2015 to 69.4% by last year. Maselesele says the situation could have been worse had it not been for the IDC\u2019s intervention. \n \nDuring the second term of last year, the IDC sent mathematics specialists to spend a week at Tshivhase to assist teachers and pupils. \n \n\u201cThey even went to the extent of teaching in the class and we believe that, had it not been for the IDC intervention, the maths percentage would have been lower.\u201d \n \nHe says it was also hard to find local maths teachers and, as a result, all maths teachers at Tshivhase are from Zimbabwe. \n \n\u201cIf things stabilise in Zimbabwe, we are going to lose them,\u201d he says, adding that the school is actively trying to bring in teaching graduates who could learn from their foreign colleagues. \n \nThe five-year partnership between the IDC and Tshivhase started in 2013. \n \nAlthough it is expected to end this year, Maselesele says he is confident it will be extended to 2018, particularly because the developmental institution has also adopted one of its feeder primary schools, Vhufuli. \n \nDuring the programme, the IDC built two new blocks in Tshivhase consisting of 12 classrooms and an ablution block, adding its name to the rich history of those who have contributed to growing the school to what it is today. \n \nIn the 1990s, former president Nelson Mandela also facilitated the building of 20 new classrooms for the school. \n \nBefore that, the school, built by the Tshivhase traditional council, had only 19 classrooms to cater for Grade 8 to Grade 12. \n \nMaselesele says the IDC\u2019s construction of the new classrooms contributed significantly to economic growth in the Vhembe area. \n \nThe building material was sourced from local suppliers and it provided local jobs. He says the budget for labour on one of the six-classroom blocks stood at more than R450 000. \n \nHowever, says Maselesele, one of the old blocks in the school is falling apart and is in desperate need of renovations. \n \nFor the past five years, as part of its social contribution, the IDC has donated sanitary towels to female pupils every year in February. \n \n\u201cThey give each girl enough to last until the next February,\u201d says Maselesele. \n \nThe other structure in the schoolyard is a 2 450-seater hall built by parents through a building fund in 2010. \n \nThe hall is not yet complete, but it is usable and it is possible for the community to book it for a small amount. Most importantly, though, it gives pupils a place to sit their exams. \n \nHe says the parents are important stakeholders in the running of the school. \n \nLast Sunday, he says, the school had an annual general meeting and parents came in numbers, despite the fact that \u201cit was raining cats and dogs\u201d. \n \nThe school governing body also plays a key and supportive role because they are elected by parents to represent their views, he says. \n \n\u201cThey are the ones who give us a mandate to run different projects. Parents still have confidence in us and that is why they are sending their children here.\u201d \n \nHe says the number of pupils increased \u201cdramatically\u201d soon after Tshivhase got a 100% matric pass rate in 2013 and the school built its reputation for good performance on the back of that record. \n \nBack in Maselesele\u2019s office, a cabinet behind his desk is full of trophies. \n \nThe situation is the same in the office of the first deputy principal, the second deputy principal and the head of department. \n \nMaselesele says the learners do not only excel in academics, but also in other activities such as cultural dancing and different sporting codes. \n \n\u201cJust look behind me. Those trophies, we did not buy them,\u201d he says. \n \n\u201cThese trophies come to this school because of our performance. We have so many that we need a special stand to keep them because we are running out of space.\u201d \n \nHe says more are still to come. \n \n\u201cAs I am speaking to you right now, we are still expecting more trophies because the district is yet to holds its prize-giving ceremony.\u201d \n \nTshivhase is guaranteed an award for its matric pass rate, the highest in the country for quintile two schools (categorised according to the poverty rate), as well as for producing the top pupil in Limpopo. \n \nOn his future ambitions, Maselesele points out that at least six to seven of Tshivhase\u2019s former principals moved on to become circuit managers. \n \nHe is prepared to follow in their footsteps, but \u201cfor now, I am enjoying it here and only time will tell\u201d. \n \nThis series is reported by City Press and supported by the IDC","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Setumo Stone"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Building a future brick by brick","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Fin24.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"582050672","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4589"},"name":"Fin24.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Financials","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fin24.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198766579","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:02Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/fin24.png"}],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Suffolk","zipCode":"11743","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Huntington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Huntington Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169715451","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Huntington Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.huntington.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695198775530","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:53:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22877259/20170128/091105/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1485654598-9499.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He's one of the staff members, part of an increasingly grey workforce in an increasingly grey country. \n \n\"I enjoy talking to the people here. It's fun, but it's also hard work,\" Odaira said during a break from his caregiving duties on a recent day. \n \nJapan is considered a \"super-aging\" society. More than a quarter of the population is over 65, a figure set to rise to 40 percent by 2050. The average life expectancy is 85, and that means many Japanese remain relatively healthy for a good two decades after retirement age. \n \nAt the same time, the birthrate has plummeted to well below the level needed to keep the population stable. Now home to 128 million people, Japan is expected to number less than 100 million by 2050, according to government projections. \n \nThat means authorities need to think about ways to keep seniors healthy and active for longer, but also about how to augment the workforce to cope with labour shortages. \n \nEnter the septuagenarian caregiver. \n \nAt Cross Heart, more than half of the 119 caregivers are over 60, and 15 of them are over 70. \n \n\"When we advertise for people to work here, we get lots of responses from older people, not younger people,\" said nursing home director Kaori Yokoo in the lobby where residents were doing leg curls and chest presses on weight machines. \n \nThe foundation that runs this nursing home and others in Kanagawa Prefecture has raised the official retirement age to 70 but allows employees to keep working until 80 if they want to and can. Municipalities around the country are also actively recruiting people over 60 to do lighter duties at nursing homes. \n \nIt's one way of dealing with the problem. Meanwhile, researchers are working on robots that can lift the elderly out of beds and wheelchairs, and inward-looking Japan is slowly coming around to the idea that it may need to allow in more foreign workers. \n \nAlthough older workers have constraints - some can't do the heavier tasks - they also offer advantages over younger workers who want time off for their children, said Yokoo, who is 41. \n \n\"Plus, because they're close in age to the residents, they can relate to each other more,\" she said. \"We younger people think this must be nice for them. Older staff can understand things like physical pains more because they are living through the same things.\" \n \nSome of the older workers here are doing it because they need the money. For others, the money is a nice benefit, but the main motivation is the activity and sense of community. \n \nKiyoko Tsuboi, a 95-year-old who comes into the rest home during the day, said she likes having Odaira around. \n \n\"He's very attentive to our needs and knows things like how hot we like our tea. My son is not as kind as Odaira-san,\" Tsuboi said as Odaira cleared away the lunch dishes. \"He's quite active despite his age, and even though he's a man, he has an eye for detail.\" \n \nThe dynamic works well for Odaira, too, who started here 17 years ago after retiring from his job in the sales department of an auto parts maker. He works eight hours a day, four days a week. \n \nHis father died when he was small, his mother when he was 22. \"It's not like I'm replacing my mother, but I thought I could help someone else's parents,\" he said. \n \nHe also does it to stay young, Odaira said with a twinkle in his eye. \"I think it's good for me physically and mentally, so as long as I can keep working, I will.\" \n \nHe's not the oldest worker here, though. That title is shared by two 78-year-olds, a man who works in the office, and Noriko Fukuju, who helps with pickups and drop-offs and does activities with \"the old people.\" \n \n\"It's fun. I enjoy it,\" she said. \n \nHiroko Akiyama, at the University of Tokyo's Institute of Gerontology, said a Japanese 65-year-old is in much better physical and mental shape than a 65-year-old a few decades ago. \"They are full of energy, and healthy and long-living,\" she said. \n \nAkiyama's research has found that working helps keep seniors that way. \"They operate on a regular schedule. They wake up, get ready, go to work and talk to people and stay connected,\" she said. \"We had a depressed old woman who changed completely after she started working.\" \n \nStill, Japan can't rely solely on seniors or, potentially, robots to staff its nursing homes, where the need will only grow as the population ages, analysts say. \n \nJapan has agreements with Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines under which applicants who complete job training and pass a Japanese language test can work at a Japanese nursing home. \n \nBut if they want to stay beyond three years, they must pass a national caregiver's exam so difficult that 40 percent of Japanese applicants fail. Many Japanese also express concern about cultural differences. \n \nNext year, the Japanese government will loosen the regulations slightly and set up a technical intern program, but there will still be time limits and difficult tests to pass. \n \nPerhaps 2,000 people will come to Japan through the intern program, said Yasuhiro Yuki, an expert on elderly care at Shukutoku University. \"But we hear we will need 300,000 more caregivers in the next 10 years,\" he said. \"So I still don't think we will have enough.\" \n \nThat means aging caregivers will increasingly become the norm. \n \n\"I can do this at least for two more years,\" said Fukuju, the 78-year-old, before she dashed out the door to renew her driver's licence.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ANNA FIFIELD"},"topics":[{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Staff in rest homes as grey as the residents","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Taranaki Daily News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169693667","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Taranaki Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Global","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198778575","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n \n___ \n \nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n \nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \n \n___ \n \nFAIRFAX, VIRGINIA \n \nDozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. \n \n___ \n \nDENVER \n \nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. \n \n___ \n \nCHICAGO \n \nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n \nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday. \n \nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n \nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n \nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n \nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" \n \n__ \n \nDALLAS \n \nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n \nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition. \n \nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n \nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \n \nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n \n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n \n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n \n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" \n \n___ \n \nSEATTLE \n \nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. \n \n___ \n \nPORTLAND, OREGON \n \nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\" \n \n___ \n \nLOS ANGELES \n \nAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil. \n \nAvriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis. \n \n___ \n \nSAN FRANCISCO \n \nHundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport's international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. \n \n___ \n \nSAN DIEGO \n \nAs motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Mecklenburg","zipCode":"28206","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Charlotte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WSOC-TV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662550","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"209"},"name":"WSOC-TV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wsoctv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198781294","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It should be seen as an opportunity to highlight all the hard work you have done in a year. There should be enthusiasm and zest. It is your decision to treat as a pleasure or pressure. Those who treat it as a pleasure will gain and those who treat it as pressure will repent. \n \n\"My view is that examination is a celebration. Take it as if it is a festival. And when there is a festival or celebration, then the best comes out of us. We feel the society's strength during celebrations. Whatever is the best comes out... Smile more to score more,\" he said. \n \nHe gave the example of discipline seen among masses in 'kumbh' fair even though it is generally felt that there is a lot of indiscipline among people. \"This is the strength of celebration.\" \n \nDuring examination, there should be a festive atmosphere among students, families and neighbours and it will convert this pressure into pleasure. \n \nHe also asked people to put examination in perspective and not treat it as \"a question of life and death or as a test of life but merely of the study students have put in during the year\". \n \nHe urged students not to chase marks but gain knowledge. \n \n\"Only studying for marks will lead to shortcuts and one will limit himself or herself. It is important to study for knowledge. Marks and marksheetd have a limited use. Knowledge, skill, self-confidence and commitment will be of use to you during life,\" Modi said. \n \nHe have the example of late President A P J Abdul Kalam's failure in an air force recruitment examination and said had he accepted it as a defeat, then India would not have got such a great scientist and President. \n \nHe also asked students to desist from resorting to shortcuts and cheating to score more. \n \n\"To cheat is to be cheap. It makes you a bad person. If you form a habit of cheating, there will be no desire to learn. Trying to cheat involves one's time to find ways. Use it for better purposes. People have told you often but I am saying again -- do not cheat. Even if no one catches you, you know that you have cheated in exams,\" he said.

It will have facilities such as berthing space for two vessels simultaneously, storage area, transit shed, parking areas, among others. \n \nThe Varanasi terminal with 0.54 million tons per annum of cargo handling capacity in Phase 1, will complement the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC) project, enabling movement of cargo from Ludhiana in Punjab to Haldia in West Bengal and further east, said an official at the Ministry. \n \n\"With the cost of transportation by waterways being 30-50 paisa per tonne per km (PTPK) only, compared to Rs 1 PTPK for rail, and Rs 1.5 PTPK for road, various government and private entities have already shown interest in transporting their cargo using the facility,\" the official added. \n \nNW-1, along with proposed EDFC and NH-2, constitutes the Eastern Transport Corridor of India connecting the National Capital Region (NCR) with the eastern and north-eastern states and will function as a link to Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Nepal and other east and south-east Asian countries through the Kolkata Port and Indo- Bangladesh Protocol Route. \n \nCurrently, a large portion of cargo from north India is transported to the ports of Kandla and Mumbai through land routes at high cost, and there is much reluctance of the shippers to transport the cargo to the eastern ports of Kolkata, Dhamra, and Paradip.

The watch can also be locked or unlocked using a correct combination of short or long breaths. \n \nVoice recognition sometimes produces incorrect words when dictating a text message. Blowing quickly on the watch can erase words, while blowing on it longer will send the text message when ready. \n \nThe technique also works with smartphones. A user can transfer content from the watch to a smartphone simply by sipping it off the watch and puffing it on the phone. \n \nThe technology could have potential for people with disabilities, researchers said. \n \nAnother new interaction technique WatchOut uses taps and scrolling gestures on the case and watchband, outside the watch screen. \n \nThey are possible because of the watch's gyroscope and accelerometer sensors, according to the researchers. \n \n\"Other techniques that improve control of smartwatches have included 3D gestures above the screen, bigger screens or adding an extra armband,\" said Cheng Zhang, a PhD student at Georgia Tech. \n \n\"We wanted to show it could be done with existing technology already common on today's devices,\" said Zhang. \n \nOne demo app allows wearers to scroll up, down, left and right by swiping on the watchband. According to Zhang it makes it easier to interact with GPS maps or menus. \n \nThe study showed that scrolling on rubber watchbands was more accurate than leather bands due to the different friction of the materials. \n \nThey also created an app that creates eight touchpoints on the device's bezel. Rather than scrolling through a long list of apps, the user simply hits one of eight spots on the case to launch Facebook, for example. \n \n\"Smartwatches aren't very convenient when you're carrying something,\" Zhang said. \n \n\"That's why we wanted to create a technique that allows the user to tap the watch to accept or deny phone calls. \n \nHitting the right side answers the call; the left side ignores it,\" he said. \n \nThe final project, TapSkin, allows users to tap on the back of their hand to input numbers 0-9 or commands. \n \nThe technique uses the watch's microphone and inertial sensors to detect a total of 11 different tapping locations on a person's skin around the watch. \n \n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"New tech lets you control smartwatches with just your breath!","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"DNA India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659516","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1346"},"name":"DNA India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198800547","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The shorthanded goal was Vermin's ninth of the year. Adam Comrie extended the Crunch lead two minutes later, blasting a one-timer past Thatcher Demko. Henri Ikonen and Pierre-Luc Leblond were credited with the assists on Comrie's fifth of the year. Carter Bancks put the Comets on the board at 17:11 with his sixth of the year, receiving a saucer pass from Mike Zalewski through two defensemen. Wacey Hamilton was also credited with an assist as the Comets trailed 2-1 after the first. \n \nEight minutes into the middle frame, Evan McEneny tied the game with a rocket from the point that squeaked through Adam Wilcox. McEneny's fifth of the year was assisted by Michael Carcone and Alexandre Grenier. Wilcox was pulled in favor of Kristers Gudlevskis after the score. Wilcox finished the night with five saves on seven shots. Dominik Masin retook the lead for the Crunch six minutes later. Cory Conacher and Michael Peca notched the assists as the Crunch took a 3-2 lead into the second intermission. \n \nJordan Subban tied the game with a power play strike halfway through the third period. Bancks and Pascal Pelletier picked up the assists on Subban's 10th goal of the season. Neither team could find the net in the final 10 minutes, sending the game to overtime. \n \nOvertime did not yield a winner, despite a Comets power play for the final 1:42. The North Division rivals would need a shooutout to decide the game. Cory Conacher scored the lone goal in the shootout to give the Crunch a 4-3 victory. \n \nDemko finished the night with 26 saves, while Gudlevskis stopped 11 of 12 shots in relief of Wilcox. \n \nThe Comets power play went 1-6, while the penalty kill was perfect, killing off all four attempts. \n \nThe Comets are back in action next Friday on the road against the Hartford Wolfpack.

With the win, the Monsters improved to 20-17-1-3 overall this season and with a .537 points percentage, remain alone in fourth place in the AHL's Central Division standings. \n \nThe Wolves grabbed a 1-0 lead on Saturday when Morgan Ellis potted an even-strength goal at 4:08 of the opening period before Chicago winger and all-time Monsters leading scorer Andrew Agozzino took advantage of a five-on-three power-play at 14:21 of the first to make it 2-0 for the visitors heading into the middle stanza. \n \nThe Monsters stormed out of the gate in period two, pulling within a goal at 2:14 thanks to Justin Scott's ninth of the season, an even-strength marker set up by Oliver Bjorkstrand. Then, with time winding down in the frame, Cleveland captain Ryan Craig deflected home a Scott power-play wrister at 18:16 to level the score at two apiece heading into the third with Sonny Milano collecting the secondary assist on the play. \n \nAfter the third period and overtime slid by scoreless, the Monsters and Wolves pushed a shootout to the ninth round, with Milano, Markus Hannikainen, Jordan Maletta and Paul Bittner providing scores for Cleveland, and Chicago's Magnus Paajarvi, Samuel Blais, Agozzino and Wade Megan posting goals for the Wolves through the first seven rounds. Then, Bjorkstrand atoned for three missed breakaways in regulation and overtime with a goal in the top of the ninth round that, paired with a Joonas Korpisalo denial of the Wolves' Brett Sterling in the bottom half of the ninth, provided the Monsters with a 3-2 victory. \n \nKorpisalo improved to 6-5-2 in net by virtue of a 25-save performance through regulation and overtime and a five-for-nine showing in the shootout while Chicago's Pheonix Copley is now 11-4-3 between the pipes for the Wolves despite stopping 30 of the 32 Monsters shots he faced. \n \nNext up for the Monsters, it's a Friday home clash vs. the Iowa Wild with full coverage, live from The Q, underway at 7:00 pm on 99X and the Monsters Hockey Network. \n \nTickets for every Monsters home game start at just $10 and are on sale now!

Maines Veterans Memorial Arena. \n \nThe Penguins opened the scoring 10:52 into the first period after Ryan Haggerty scored his seventh goal of the season releasing a wrist shot from the left faceoff circle with assists from Danny Kristo and David Warsofsky for a 1-0 lead. \n \nThe visitors doubled the lead almost five minutes later following a flurry in front of B-Sens' starting goaltender Chris Driedger. Dominik Simon scored his sixth goal of the year after Driedger was knocked out of position with Teddy Blueger and Garrett Wilson picking up the assists. \n \nBinghamton got on the board with just under three minutes to play in the opening frame courtesy of Nick Paul's sixth goal of the season. Jason Akeson carried the puck through a crowd of defenders and took a shot from the slot. Penguins' goaltender Tristan Jarry kick saved Akeson's shot, but sent the rebound directly to Paul who sent it home. Chris Carlisle also assisted on Binghamton's first goal of the night. \n \nWilkes-Barre/Scranton scored two more goals in the first period just 21 seconds apart to bring the score to 4-1. The first goal came after Blueger sent a pass from the goal line to Jean-Sebastien Dea waiting at Driedger's right hand side. Dea beat Driedger and Simon was awarded the secondary assist on Dea's 12th goal of the year. \n \nBlueger completed his three-point night with the final goal of the first period. Ethan Prow set up a rush to Simon along the right side of the ice who then sent a cross ice path to Blueger on the left side. Blueger shot the puck to the top shelf of the net closing the period with the B-Sens trailing 4-1 and ending Driedger's night. \n \nBinghamton came out fast in the second period cutting the Penguin's lead in half just over six minutes into the frame. Alex Krushelnyski sent a pass from the right faceoff circle to Ben Harpur who was waiting at the blue line. Harpur let a shot rip through a crowd of players and Chad Nehring redirected the shot for his third goal of the year. \n \nWilkes-Barre/Scranton got two goals past Matt O'Connor over the final 30 minutes of play to push the final score to 6-2 in favor of the visitors. Kristo scored his fourth goal of the season at the 11:13 mark of the second period with assists from Derrick Pouliot and Tim Erixon. \n \nPenguins' captain Tom Kostopoulos scored the lone goal of the final frame with less than eight minutes to play. Kostopoulos tallied his 15th goal of the year with assists from Sahir Gill and Warsofsky. \n \nDriedger had 10 saves in the losing effort while O'Connor stopped nine shots in relief. Jarry finished the night with 32 stops to earn the win. \n \nThe Binghamton Senators are back on home next Friday and Saturday night following the AHL All-Star Classic.

The State Duma voted 380-3 on Friday to eliminate criminal liability for battery on family members that doesn't cause bodily harm, making it punishable instead by a fine or a 15-day arrest. \n \nThe law needs to be approved by the largely rubber-stamp upper chamber and signed by President Vladimir Putin, who has signalled his support. The bill has raised fears that it could sow impunity for those who beat up their wives and children, but its supporters have argued that it retains criminal responsibility for repeat offenders. \n \nThe measure is a response to conservative criticism of the current law, seen by some as a threat to parents who might spank their children. The bill stems from 2016's Supreme Court ruling to decriminalise battery that doesn't inflict bodily harm, but to retain criminal charges for those accused of battery against family members. The Duma then approved the corresponding legislation only to change course now. \n \nAndrei Isayev of the main Kremlin faction, the United Russia, said lawmakers are \"heeding the public call\" by correcting a mistake they made in 2016. \n \nA survey this month by state-run pollster VTsIOM showed that 19 percent of Russians said \"it can be acceptable\" to hit one's wife, husband or child \"in certain circumstances.\" \n \nThe nationwide poll by phone of 1,800 people was held January 13-15. The survey had a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points. \n \nCritics of the measure have warned that it would encourage domestic violence and fuel crime. \n \n\"This bill would establish violence as a norm of conduct,\" Communist lawmaker Yuri Sinelshchikov said during the debate. Data on domestic violence in Russia is scarce, but Interior Ministry statistics show that 40 percent of all violent crimes in Russia are committed in family surroundings. \n \nIn 2013, more than 9,000 women were reported to have been killed in domestic violence. Russian police are often reluctant to react to domestic violence calls, which many regard as meddling in family affairs. \n \nProsecutors in November began investigating a police officer who took a call from a woman complaining about her boyfriend's aggressive behaviour. Instead of offering help, the officer reportedly told the woman that the police would only come if she got killed. Shortly afterward, the man beat the woman to death.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Russian lawmakers decriminalise some domestic violence","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"DNA India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659516","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1346"},"name":"DNA India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198809341","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:37:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://static.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/third/public/2017/01/29/543327-state-duma-moscow-parliament-russia-j20.jpg?itok=NvzkMf6f"}],"video":[]}}

The suit said their connections to U.S. forces made them targets in their home country and that the pair had valid visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe lawsuit highlights some of the legal obstacles facing Trump's new administration as it tries to carry out the directive, which the president signed late on Friday to impose a four-month ban on refugees entering the United States and a 90-day hold on travelers from Syria, Iran and five other Muslim-majority countries. \n \nIn an emergency ruling on Saturday, U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly ordered U.S. authorities to refrain from deporting previously approved refugees as well as \"approved holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals ... legally authorized to enter the United States\" from the countries targeted in Trump's order. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the temporary stay, said it would help about 100 to 200 people who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports after Trump signed the order. \n \n\"I am directing the government to stop removal if there is someone right now in danger of being removed,\" Donnelly said in the court hearing. \"No one is to be removed in this class.\" \n \nU.S. Department of Justice attorney Susan Riley during the hearing said, \"This has unfolded with such speed that we haven't had an opportunity to address all the legal issues.\" \n \nMany of the people in a huge crowd that had gathered outside the Brooklyn courthouse broke out into cheers after word of the judge's ruling filtered out. \n \nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security in a statement hours later said only a small fraction of airline passengers arriving in the United States on Saturday were \"inconvenienced while enhanced security measures were implemented.\" \n \n\"These individuals went through enhanced security screenings and are being processed for entry to the United States, consistent with our immigration laws and judicial orders,\" the statement said. \n \nThe department said Trump's executive order remained in place and that its officers would enforce it. \n \nSeparately, a group of state attorneys general were discussing whether to file their own court challenge against Trump's order, officials in three states told Reuters. \n \n\"TARGETED BY TERRORISTS\" \n \nThe plight of one of the men who brought the lawsuit, a former U.S. Army interpreter who was detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport, is especially compelling, said David Leopold, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, who is not involved in the suit. \n \n\"Here is a guy who was a translator who worked for the U.S. military for years, who himself was targeted by terrorists,\" he said. \"It is clear that if he is sent back, he is facing a direct threat to his life.\" \n \nThat man, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released later on Saturday and told a crowd of reporters at JFK Airport that he did not have ill feelings about his detention. \n \n\"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world,\" he said. \n \nDarweesh, 53, worked for the U.S. Army and for a U.S. contractor in Iraq from 2003 to 2013 as an interpreter and engineer, the lawsuit said. \n \nThe second plaintiff, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, 33, was also detained at JFK Airport but has since been released. He is the husband of an Iraqi woman who worked for a U.S. contractor in Iraq. She already lives in Houston, the suit said. \n \nTrump, a Republican, has said his order would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. \n \nThe lawsuit on behalf of the Iraqis challenges Trump's order on several grounds. It says the order violates the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of due process by taking away their ability to apply for asylum, and violates the guarantee of equal protection by discriminating against them on the basis of their country of origin without sufficient justification. \n \nIt also says the order violates procedural requirements of federal rulemaking. \n \nThe next hearing in the case was set for Feb. 10. \n \nSupporters of the order say the president has wide authority to limit the entry of foreign nationals from specific countries when it is in the national interest. \n \n\"Even if they do and they win, my answer is so what?\" said Mark Krikorian, the director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies. \n \n\"We are talking a few dozen people - that is just a last-ditch effort to get the last few people in. It doesn't really change the policy,\" he said. \n \nTrump's order does not mention specific religions but Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday he was acting to help Christians in Syria who were \"horribly treated.\" \n \nComments like that could come back to haunt the president in litigation over his order, said Hiroshi Motomura, an immigration expert at UCLA School of Law. \n \n\"There were comments during the campaign that focused very much on religion as the target,\" Motomura said. \"If the record showed that the origins of a particular measure were based on targeting a particular group, that could be challenged in court.\" \n \n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Terrorism news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"UPDATE 4-Two Iraqis lead legal fight against Trump order blocking entry","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"DNA India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659516","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1346"},"name":"DNA India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198810311","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:40:16Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Fear of immigration is often greatest in areas where actual immigration is low. \n \nBut as I continued speaking to him, he fleshed out what he meant. \n \nHe said when he left school in the 1960s you were guaranteed a stable job. For 37 years he had worked in a rubber factory which exported goods all over the world until it shut down. \n \nAfter the decline of the manufacturing and mining industries in Barnsley and elsewhere, young people simply weren't given that same promise of a stable job they could be proud of. \n \nIt was a refrain that came up again and again. \n   \nWhen people say immigration is their reason for voting to leave the EU, often they are referring to the more complex reason of globalisation \n Sophy Ridge   \nGrandfathers worried about their grandchildren. A woman who said Barnsley had been \"forgotten\" by politicians. A man who believed that after the decline of mining in the area \"people are on the breadline\". \n \nHe added with a smile: \"But we keep plodding on.\" \n \nWhen people say immigration is their reason for voting to leave the EU, often they are referring to the more complex reason of globalisation. Yes, that means free movement of people and immigration levels. \n \nBut it also means the decline of the traditional British industries and the increase of cheap imported goods from elsewhere. \n \nFor the older generation, British manufacturing was in a far better state before the UK joined the EU. \n \nOnce outside again, will it thrive again? It's a roll of the dice, a high stakes gamble.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: movie news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Sky Views: The real reason for the Leave vote","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Sky News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659622","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2432"},"name":"Sky News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts","Film"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://news.sky.com/","publisher":"British Sky Broadcasting"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198812106","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That center, built in the mid-1800s, leaks heat the way an old wooden dam leaks water \u2014 all the time, in innumerable places. \n \nBut in mid-November, two workmen from HE-Energy Solutions came and calked hundreds of those leaks. They installed new weather-stripping on all my doors, wrapped pipes and replaced more than 20 of the light bulbs in the house with new LED bulbs that will use much less energy and last for years. \n \nIt took the two men about four hours to do all the work. It cost me $124, but all the weather-stripping, all the LED bulbs, all the calking and insulating wrapping on my pipes were included in the price. \n \nThe work should save me about $400 a year on heating oil and electricity, if I remember to keep the back door closed on cold days. (\u201cDo you think you\u2019re living in a barn?\u201d my parents used to ask rhetorically when I left the door open as a kid. I guess I still do think that.) \n \nAnd it\u2019s a very small, useful way of reducing the energy I use. The less energy, the less need for new transmission wires and natural gas generators and heating oil pumped out of the ground. I know it\u2019s only a tiny fraction of everything, but it\u2019s my tiny fraction. \n \nAnd those fractions add up. The 2015 Report of the Connecticut Energy Efficiency Board estimates that in that year, all the energy efficiency programs in the state took nearly 3.3 million tons of carbon dioxide out of the air, equivalent to taking 786,694 cars off the road. \n \n\u201cWe should think of this as recycled energy, energy that\u2019s returned to the marketplace,\u201d said Diane Duva , director of energy demand at the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection . \u201cIt\u2019s like when we recycle aluminum. We get to use it again.\u201d \n \nEach year, about 40,000 Connecticut homeowners avail themselves of the work I had done, through Energize CT\u2019s Home Energy Solutions program. To learn more, or to sign up, go to energizect.com or call 1-877-WISE-USE. \n \nA few years ago, Ridgefield First Selectman Rudy Marconi had Home Energy Solutions stop up at least some of the energy leaks in his home, built in the 1890s. He figures it now saves him at least $75 a month in energy costs. \n \nAnd, other being at home when the workmen arrived, it required no work on his part. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a very smart thing to do,\u201d Marconi said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the environment and it saves you money. It\u2019s a win-win situation.\u201d \n \nWhile the state utilities help administer the Home Energy Solutions program, Connecticut residents pay for it, with a few pennies a month from every utility bill put aside for energy efficiency programs. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s really something you can do right now,\u201d said Mitch Gross , spokesman for Eversource. \u201cIt helps the state control energy costs and it makes your house more comfortable. It keeps the warm air in in the winter and the cool air in in the summer.\u201d \n \nGross also pointed out that the program installs equipment like aerators to faucets that can reduce water use in a home by as much as 1,000 gallons a year. That saves money on water bills and also helps the community at large. \n \n\u201cThe last time I checked, we were still in a drought,\u201d Gross said. \n \nAnother way of thinking of energy that\u2019s not used \u2014 and is therefore available to be used at a later date \u2014 is as alternative energy. It\u2019s like wind power without the turbines, solar power without the panels. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s by far the cleanest source of energy we have and the cheapest,\u201d said energy consultant Joel Gordes . \n \n\u201cIt costs 4 cents a kilowatt hour to conserve energy and 17 cents an hour to purchase it.\u201d \n \nChris Phelps , executive director of Environment CT , said that Connecticut is a national leader in its energy efficiency programs. \n \n\u201cWhat we\u2019re now seeing is that while energy use overall in the state is leveling off, or even declining slightly, the state economy is growing,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to break the linkage between use of energy and economic growth.\u201d \n \nA new study shows that nationwide, about 2.2 million people are employed in energy efficiency work, Phelps said. That\u2019s more than in any other sector of the U.S. energy production. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about power plants anymore,\u201d he said. \n \nContact Robert Miller at earthmattersrgm@gmail.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Robert Miller"},"topics":[{"name":"Renewable energy news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Robert Miller: How to make your house more energy efficient","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fairfield","zipCode":"06810","state":"Connecticut","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Danbury","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News-Times","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169658335","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"616"},"name":"News-Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newstimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198817961","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A fierce Burkina Faso side took on a technically sound Tunisia . The North Africans had surprised everyone as they played an exciting brand of football throughout the tournament. \n \nIt was a bright start with both teams looking to get onto the front foot. The Burkinabe had a glorious chance to open the scoring but Prejuce Nakoulma scuffed his effort high and wide. They continued to grow in confidence and Bertrand Traore almost grabbed the opener. But the Chelsea Academy graduate\u2019s shot could only skim the top of the crossbar. As the half time whistle approached it was the Lions of Carthage who took aim for the elusive goal but the ball went agonisingly wide off the far post. Neither team could break the deadlock in what was a tightly contested opening half. \n \nDR Congo vs Ghana - Five players to watch \n \nThe second half was a more open encounter. The Stallions looked the livelier of the two sides and threatened the Tunisian defence but they lacked the decisive final ball. It was substitute Aristide Bance\u2019s free kick 10 minutes before the end of the match which saw the deadlock broken. The former Chippa United player had only been on the pitch for four minutes before sending the ball whistling into the bottom corner of the Tunisian net. Bance was an inspired substitution by Burkinabe coach Paulo Duarte as minutes later he was denied a second goal by the post. \n \nThe Tunisians knew they had to throw caution to the wind as they went in search of the equaliser. However, it was a blistering Burkina Faso counter attack in the 83rd minute that saw the North Africans crash out. Nakoulma calmly slotted the ball into an open net after beating Tunisian goalkeeper Aymen Mathlouthi who had found himself in no man\u2019s land. With the final whistle blown the West Africans booked their place in the semi-final. \n \n\n \nThe second game of the night was a mammoth encounter. when Cameroon t ook on tournament favourites Senegal . The crowd at the Stade de Franceville were in for a tantalising affair as the two Lions of African football fought valiantly. The opening stanza was a tightly fought physical contest.  The Senegalese looked the more confident of the two teams as Cameroon were content to play on the counter attack. Chances were few and far between and with the half finely balanced and neither team able to grab the game by the scruff of the neck. \n \nThe second half was a more open affair but Senegal continued to dominate. The Indomitable Lions defence stood resolute throughout the half. Cameroonian keeper Fabrice Ondoa denied Stoke City forward Mame Biram Diouf from point blank range. The four time Afcon champions showed they weren\u2019t out of the contest when Benjamin Moukandjo found himself in space but Diallo in the Senegalese goal was equal to the task. \n \nREVEALED: The Nations Cup Passmasters \n \nAs the final whistle approached the Teranga Lions displayed a look of disbelief as the plucky Cameroonians survived the onslaught of Senegalese pressure. Extra time would be needed as the two African giants could not be separated after 90 minutes. \n \nBoth teams began to show signs of fatigue in the  first half of extra time as another fifteen minutes of immense defending saw the Indomitable Lions remain in the game. On the stroke of half time Cameroonian Jacques Zoua found himself in space but his shot was superbly saved by impervious Diallo. \n \nThe second half was nail-biting but neither team could grab the elusive goal as the game was destined to be decided by a penalty shootout. The dreaded Penalty shootout saw Sadio Mane\u2019s penalty saved by the superb 21 year-old Fabrice Ondoa. Cameroons Vincent Abubakar scored the winning penalty as Cameroon progressed into the semi-finals. \n \nRanking the top Nations Cup goalscorers of the group stage","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"ICYMI AFCON Match Day 13: Ondoa\u2019s heroics seals Cameroon semi-final berth","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sporting News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169820252","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"137"},"name":"Sporting News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Soccer","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.aol.sportingnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.goal.com/en-gh/news/8572/2017-africa-cup-of-nations?ICID=FX_TN_2_1","http://www.goal.com/en-gh/teams/burkina-faso/burkina-faso/383?ICID=MP_TS_HDH_1","http://www.goal.com/en-gh/teams/tunisia/tunisia/2211?ICID=MP_TS_HDA_1","http://www.goal.com/en-gh/news/8572/2017-africa-cup-of-nations/2017/01/28/32063892/dr-congo-vs-ghana-five-players-to-watch?ICID=SP_HN_HP_RI_0_3","http://www.goal.com/en-gh/teams/cameroon/cameroon/386?ICID=MP_TS_HDA_1","http://www.goal.com/en-gh/teams/senegal/senegal/1941?ICID=MP_TS_HDH_1","http://www.goal.com/en-gh/news/8572/2017-africa-cup-of-nations/2017/01/28/32035752/revealed-the-nations-cup-passmasters?ICID=SP","http://www.goal.com/en-gh/news/8572/2017-africa-cup-of-nations/2017/01/27/32024662/ranking-the-top-nations-cup-goalscorers-of-the-group-stage?ICID=SP"],"sequenceId":"695198819091","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:39:06Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.performgroup.com/di/library/GOAL/22/d2/karl-toko-ekampi-cameroon_jap25m92gx0e1nidd3tzn908t.jpg?t=-1165758103"}],"video":[]}}

This was evident on the day after Inauguration Day when Washington, D.C. and other cities were filled with protesters from the Women\u2019s March. No matter who is in charge of our nation, we are called to be faithful and build up the Kingdom of God here on earth. One of my heroes, Archbishop José Gomez of Los Angeles, recently stated that, \u201cPoliticians come and go; nations rise and fall; empires fade away -- what remains is God and his Church.\u201d \n \nWhat really matters is that Jesus Christ is still King. However, each one of us can impact our nation -- since our identity and our dignity are found in God and not any political party. \n \nIf we want America to be great, then we need people who are committed to living their faith and serving God in every aspect of their lives. If we want our leaders to be just, fair and caring, then we too must promote these virtue and values and live them out in our own lives. \n \nLast September, Mother Teresa of Calcutta was canonized in Rome. She always told her sisters that they should strive to become saints. These words from a woman filled with wisdom from God are very appropriate for our nation today. We, too, like the religious sisters of the Missionaries of Charity, should endeavor to become saints. Mother Teresa walked through the streets of Norristown and touched the hearts of many persons here. We should emulate her compassionate example and become saints in the world, untouched by its worldly lures. We as a nation have lost the sense of a human person. We no longer value the lives of every individual from conception to natural death. All of us are children of God. However, if each one of us strives to be moral, charitable and spiritual with others, we will impact the world. Ways to do so are to pray as all saints have done and develop a strong, healthy and steady relationships with God and others. We must, first, build up important relationships in marriage and with our children. Each family is special in the eyes of God. \n \n \nIn addition, we are called to be witnesses to God through our lives lived with compassion and mercy -- two wonderful gifts from God. One way begin is by being decent and generous to strangers and immigrants in our nation. Words from my Archbishop Charles Chaput are very fitting, \u201c We need to help the president do what is right, support him when he does and resist him -- respectfully but firmly -- when he does not.\u201d \n \nThus, we, our families and our nation can be renewed and be great no matter who is president because God is still in charge. As Mother Teresa has said over and over again, to renew this world to be like the Kingdom of God we must become saints! \n \nThe Rev. Gus Puleo is pastor of St. Patrick Church in Norristown and adjunct professor of Spanish at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Philadelphia. He is a graduate of Norristown High School and attended Georgetown University, where he received B.A. and B.S. in Spanish and linguistics. He has master\u2019s degrees in Spanish, linguistics and divinity from Middlebury College, Georgetown University and St. Charles Borromeo Seminary.

His official statement regarding the US president's immigration ban takes virtually no position aside from that America is great. \n \nPhoto: Getty \n \nKalanick joined other tech companies this afternoon in addressing the impact that the travel ban will have on his employees: \n  \nOur People Ops team has already reached out to the dozen or so employees who we know are affected: for example, those who live and work in the U.S., are legal residents but not naturalized citizens will not be able to get back into the country if they are travelling outside of the U.S. now or anytime in the next 90 days. Anyone who believes that this order could impact them should contact [email protected] immediately. \n  \nA dozen or so employees doesn't seem to indicate that the ban will have a terribly large impact on the company. Microsoft, for example, says it has identified 76 employees that would be affected by the order. But Kalanick goes on to acknowledge that \"thousands of drivers\" in Uber's unofficial workforce come from the listed countries. \n  \nWe are working out a process to identify these drivers and compensate them pro bono during the next three months to help mitigate some of the financial stress and complications with supporting their families and putting food on the table. We will have more details on this in the coming days. \n  \nThat's good, we look forward to hearing more details about the ways in which Uber will take care of the people drive for them. With that out of the way, Kalanick gets into some vague talk about politics and avoids all mention of real principles. \n  \nEver since Uber's founding we've had to work with governments and politicians of all political persuasions across hundreds of cities and dozens of countries. Though we share common ground with many of them, we have had areas of disagreement with each of them. In some cases we've had to stand and fight to make progress, other times we've been able to effect change from within through persuasion and argument. \n  \nSo, what sort of change would he like to see occur through his company's use of \"persuasion and argument?\" He doesn't say. Instead he points out that he sits on Trump's economic advisory board and that the bans impact on innocent people is an issue that he \"will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington.\" \n \nHe throws out a bromide about it being \"OK\" for people to disagree with his choices to collaborate with Trump: \n  \nI understand that many people internally and externally may not agree with that decision, and that's OK. It's the magic of living in America that people are free to disagree. But whatever your view please know that I've always believed in principled confrontation and just change \n  \nAnd he wraps up by bragging that he has \"never shied away (maybe to my detriment) from fighting for what's right,\" even though that's exactly what he just did. \n \nOne can argue that having a seat at the table with Trump gives someone special access to change things for the better. That doesn't mean that you have to keep your mouth shut about your company's official perspective on the issue. Kalanick acknowledges how many people that helped make him rich will be hurt by this order but says nothing to stand up for them. \n \nBefore the US election, many in Silicon Valley worried about the \"Muslim ban\" because of the potential impact it might have on their workforce and the brain drain that it could cause in the United States. Now that the travel restrictions have been put into place, responses from the tech world have slowly trickled out. \n \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg jumped in early yesterday with a post expressing his concerns. He at least stated his beliefs that law enforcement shouldn't penalise people who have done no wrong and that we should be accepting refugees. Asked by Gizmodo if the company had anything to add today, a spokesperson responded: \"We are assessing the impact on our workforce and determining how best to protect our people and their families from any adverse effects.\" \n \nGoogle has gone a little further . Its CEO Sundar Pichai announced that the search giant was urging its 187 employees that will be directly affected by the ban to get home immediately. Pichai did acknowledge that it is \"painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues\" and \"we wouldn't wish this fear and uncertainty on anyone \u2014 and especially not our fellow Googlers.\" \n \nMeanwhile, Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella posted an internal email from the company's president, Brad Smith. Nadella highlighted a paragraph from the message and said that Microsoft would continue to \"advocate on this important topic.\" The selected paragraph reads: \n  \nAs a company, Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system. We also believe in broader immigration opportunities, like the protections for talented and law-abiding young people under the Deferred Access for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program, often called \"Dreamers\". We believe that immigration laws can and should protect the public without sacrificing people's freedom of expression or religion. And we believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings. \n  \nIt's not exactly strong on its condemnation but at least we have an idea of where they stand. \n \nApple CEO Tim Cook went with a Martin Luther King Jr quote and said that the ban is \"not a policy we support\". \n \nTwitter's Jack Dorsey tweeted , \"The Executive Order's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting. We benefit from what refugees and immigrants bring to the U.S.\" He also linked to the Internet Association's more robust statement . \n \nReed Hastings, CEO of Netflix, finally showed these guys how simple it is to just fucking condemn this bogus and likely illegal order: \n  \nTrump's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all. Worse, these actions will make America less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe. A very sad week, and more to come with the lives of over 600,000 Dreamers here in a America under imminent threat. It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity. \n  \nThat wasn't so hard. The action is un-American and we should stand up against. And oh look, Mark Zuckerberg seems to feel the same way: \n \nScreenshot of the likes on Reed Hastings status update","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Rhett Jones"},"topics":[{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US immigration news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Uber's CEO Praises The 'Magic Of America' In Statement On US Immigration Ban","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Gizmodo Australia","feed":{"genre":"Blog","tags":[],"id":"172875147","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2953"},"name":"Gizmodo Australia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional","ElectronicEquipment"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gizmodo.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/yesterdays-us-executive-order-immigration-satya-nadella?trk=prof-post","http://www.zdnet.com/article/silicon-valley-unites-against-donald-trump/","https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103460278231481?pnref=story","https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/28/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-fears-impact-of-trump-immigration-order-recalls-staff/","https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/read-apple-ceo-tim-cooks-email-to-employees-about-trumps-ref?utm_term=.brMwWAqEO#.lyqNqoJg9","https://twitter.com/jack/status/825476172658200577","https://internetassociation.org/president-trumps-executive-order-immigration/","https://www.facebook.com/reed1960/posts/10154654737174584","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/opinion/trumps-immigration-ban-is-illegal.html"],"sequenceId":"695198826619","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T18:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://feeds.gizmodo.com.au/-/264453784/0/gizmodoaustralia.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The initiative was joined by 27 regional libraries across the country each of which nominates the reader who has taken out the biggest number of books in 2016. The campaign, launched by MEP Maria Gabriel, aims to encourage reading among all ages. The prize for this year\u2019s winners is a visit to the European Parliament in Brussels. They will be joined by the 2015 winners, as their own visit was postponed, because it coincided with the period of high risk of a terror attack in the Belgian capital. \n\n\u201cThis year the organizers decided against selecting just one reader of the year, but to bestow the honorary distinction on all. This decision was made because their results were very close \u2013 most of them had taken out more than 200 books during the year,\u201d said Sofia City Library Director Yulia Tsinzova.\n\n\u201cThey all deserve to be congratulated and deserve to win. Winner No. 1 is the reader of the Sofia City Library who has read 231 books in 365 days. Readers like him are people who take up a book every spare minute they have. They do more than read, they lobby for book reading. I know that many people organize a group of friends and acquaintances who also read the books they have taken out of the library, then they too become readers of ours. That is why the number of library card holders has been growing and now stands at 41,000. In the first ten days of 2017, 10,000 books were taken out, a clear sign that the library is growing more and more popular as an institution.\u201d\n\nEkaterina Schultz is Reader of the Year for 2016 in Varna. She is just 17 and goes to the School of Mathematics in the city. She started reading when she was in the 5th or 6th grade because she had made the acquaintance of people who read a lot and that provoked her own interest in reading. Ekaterina says that her taste in books has evolved with time, that she first enjoyed fantasy but now prefers world classics. \n\n\u201cI love to read, I go to the school library, it is a very good library and I think it is a good model of how libraries as an institution can interact with readers. There is only one librarian, but when new books have to be bought for the library, we raise money by organizing charity bazaars. We cook the food ourselves, then sell it to the students and spend the proceeds on books for the library. So, we choose what titles to buy and that is a very good example of a library functioning in such a way as to keep its readers happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very rewarding, reading is a delight, it is magic and it is so good to receive prizes for something you enjoy doing anyway,\u201d says another one of the winners \u2013 Kaloyana Slavova who, as card holder of the Sofia City Library even orders books online:\n\n\u201cI love fiction, especially by contemporary authors like Jonathan Franzen. I enjoy books about life, about people, about the complexity of human relationships, about the obstacles the human race has surmounted in its history. Often, we can identify our own selves in books, we can see what people like us have done in similar situations. I really enjoy discovering the wealth of language, the words authors use in their books. Reading is a delight to the senses. It becomes indispensable, and as some authors say \u2013 the unpunished drug, reading, is a life-long addiction.\u201d\n\nEnglish version: Milena Daynova \n\nThe numbers of waterbirds in the world have been monitored since 1967.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"David Ellery"},"topics":[{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Werriwa Wiener dash claims world dachsund record","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2567","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Narellan","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wollondilly Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"346769048","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Wollondilly Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wollondillyadvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198827600","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:10:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:47:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/01e2e8d0-6ac5-4e81-9bc2-708dc395bfb7.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The Railways provides concession on tickets to more than 50 categories of passengers which include senior citizens, students, research scholars, teacher, doctor, nurse, patients, sports people, unemployed youth, Arjun awardees among others. \n \nAt present, Railways is running a pilot project for senior citizens who are entitled for rail concessions.

The government has decided to end the 92-year-old practice of presenting a separate Railway budget and merged it with the General Budget. \n \nJaitley, according to sources, will contribute few pages of his Budget to programmes and schemes related to Indian Railways. \n \nAlthough there will be a single budget, the Railways will continue to have autonomy as commercial undertaking and the existing financial arrangement will remain. The Railways is expected to get exemption from payment of dividend to the Union government, a move which will help strengthening its finances. \n \nThe organisation will also get budget support to meet part of its capital expenditure and will be allowed to raise extra budgetary resources. According to sources, Railways would continue to bear the expenditure on social and public service obligations. \n \nIt is also expected that Jaitley will present a separate statement of budget estimates and demand for grants for Railways in the General Budget.

Tax experts say, Jaitley, who had in his previous budget hiked service tax rate by 0.5 per cent to 15 per cent, may raise the levy by at least one percentage point to 16 per cent. \n \nSome others feel there could be different service tax rates with a lower 12 per cent for basic services and a higher 18 per cent for the rest. Also, a higher service tax for April-June will help the government garner more revenue to meet expenses on schemes and programmes it may be planning to contain the impact of demonetisation. \n \nA service tax rate closer to the GST rate will also help consumers avoid a greater price shock when the new national sales tax is rolled out. While service tax until now is a central levy, it will be equally split between the Centre and states under the new GST regime. \n \nMost services, except essential ones like primary healthcare and basic education, will be covered by GST. Service tax was budgeted to provide Rs 2.31 lakh crore in 2016-17, more than 14 per cent of the Centre's total tax revenues of Rs 16.30 lakh crore. \n \nThis will be the third time that Jaitley will raise service tax rate. Service tax from June 1, 2015 was hiked from 12.36 per cent to 14 per cent. A 0.5 per cent Swachh Bharat Cess was levied on all services, taking the total incidence of service tax to 14.5 per cent from November 15, 2015. \n \nIn the last Budget, he imposed a Krishi Kalyan Cess at the rate of 0.5 per cent on all taxable services to take the levy to 15 per cent.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Tax news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Service tax likely to be hiked by 16-18 per cent in budget","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Deccan Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673440","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"137"},"name":"Deccan Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198834809","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:47:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In its centenary year the Ballarat RSL is more confident than ever that it will last the test of time and continue to play a vital role in community relations. When the group first formed 100 years ago it was a place for returned servicemen to meet up and confide in each other. \n\nNow the group plays a vital role connecting returned service men and women and their families with support services and pensions available through the Department of Veteran Affairs.\n\nThe branch\u2019s current and first female president Alexandra Tascas said reaching a centenary was critical \u2013 particularly when many other branches were struggling to survive. \n\nShe said it was a tribute to the willingness of the branch and its members to remain involved in the community and to broaden its direction and focus. \n\n\u201cThe significance (of the celebration) is that for 100 years we have been a constant RSL with continued service to the community which is only getting stronger,\u201d Ms Tascas said.\n\nThe branch will move from its home of six years, The George, to the Midlands Gold Club in June this year once it\u2019s new rooms have been built. \n\nThe unanimous decision was made largely because of an aging population and the golf club\u2019s better parking facilities. \n\n\u201cThe role of the RSL is to look after service men and service women and those that been in the services including the Army, Navy and Airforce,\u201d Ms Tascas said.\n\nBut the branch\u2019s role is ever evolving.\n\nIt uses funds raised from its Anzac Day and Remembrance Day collections tom employ a welfare officer to help returned service people transition back into civilian life. Ms Tascas said it can be difficult to return to society and some veterans suffer Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. \n\n\u201cThe officers can help with pensions and access to services. That\u2019s our main work to make sure we support those that have served,\u201d Ms Tascas said. \n\n\u201cWe have to change, and we are stronger than ever.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut we also do things for the community. For the first time we paid for and support two children from lower socio-economic backgrounds to attend a camp in Portsea.\u201d \n\nThey loved every moment of the camp and the branch hopes to continue to send more children to the camp. \n\n\u201cWe have to engage with the community and it\u2019s really good as they can ask us what we can do for them.\u201d \n\nThe story first appeared on The Courier.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Olivia Shying@oliviashying"},"topics":[{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"RSL still relevant century forward","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"3460","state":"Victoria","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Daylesford","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Hepburn Advocate","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"444664893","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"The Hepburn Advocate","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hepburnadvocate.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198839464","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:36:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:47:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/NZXMGVFj5Cp6uxrm5dGesD/a5e9b111-e539-46c1-b8aa-63ad0fd42aa9.jpg/r0_257_4716_2922_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Much of that has not been able to be slashed and is continuing to dry out and poses a significant risk of high fire danger days. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s significant fuel in the district and that intensifies the problem. (The danger) is pretty much throughout the whole state of Victoria, right from north western Victoria all the way through,\u201d Mr Dowie said. \n\nHe has reminded all Victorians to ensure they are aware of the restrictions on a total fire ban.\n\n\u201cThat high risk activity, we are asking people to delay till later in the week We are really asking them to be smart as well as well (do what is) legal \u2013 use common sense,\u201d Mr Dowie said.\n\nTemperatures are expected to plunge on Monday night with temperatures on Tuesday expected to reach a maximum of 23.\n\nConditions will remain cool through the week, with temperatures picking up on Friday Saturday. Mr Russell said low wind activity forecast for the following week would significantly reduce the fire risk.

Working with others to accomplish great things develops a sense of goodwill in society, as it does in small group settings, that will last a very long time. \n   \nVictoria concluded by offering her opinion that society will derive great benefits from youth exploring and pursuing careers that they love and that motivate them to accomplish great things. \n   \nRotarians then participated in the first club assembly of the new year.

I\u2019ve gone over 54 matches with Bafana and over 30 matches with the under 23s,\u201d he told Soccer Laduma. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of matches at national level and, for me, I can\u2019t just be a journeyman, I can\u2019t just be an assistant coach all the time. So, I\u2019ve got to weigh up my options, see what the bosses say and then just take it from there.\u201d \n \nBenni: I Want To Transform Players Into Stars \n \nDa Gama was then asked directly whether he\u2019d be interested in taking over the hotseat, to which he replied by providing reasons why he\u2019s suited to the role. \n \n\u201cIt would be an honour to be Bafana coach one day, I think any coach in South Africa would be interested,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s that natural progression, so why not? I\u2019ve got the experience and I\u2019ve coach at the highest level in the PSL, I\u2019ve played at the highest level in Europe, and we\u2019ve got immediate knowledge of the team, so why not? I\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in myself and my ability, but I will wait for my bosses at SAFA, however, to give me directions.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Da Gama Hints At Interest In Bafana Job","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Soccer Laduma","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662075","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"28"},"name":"Soccer Laduma","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","Soccer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.soccerladuma.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198856023","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:47:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Charity is a freshman at the college. \n   \nFamily and friends were in attendance on Jan. 14, watching Mariah capture the title as Miss Windy City at the pageant. Along with her sister Charity, mom Carla Reaves and best friend, Helena Hunt were in the audience. Cydney Reaves, Mariah\u2019s little sister, competed in the Miss Chicago Pageant Princess event. Hunt, who grew up in Sonoita, now works and lives in the Chicago area. \n   \nMariah\u2019s efforts to raise awareness about youth trauma on Chicago\u2019s South Side was a central message in her efforts to secure the Miss Windy City pageant title. \n   \n\u201cI have a strong sense of dedication to Chicago's youth, and want to ultimately, impact the nation- educating others about the issues of trauma in youth and inspire other adults to invest in the lives of children in their own communities, combatting this issue and giving all children the opportunities they deserve: to be happy and live well,\u201d Mariah said in her contest essay. \n   \nOver the past four years, Mariah has been directly involved with youth mentorship and witnessed the positive impact it has on the lives of young people. She is a volunteer with the Chicago-based youth mentorship, \"By The Hand\" Club for Kids and Group Outreach for Youth. Her experience includes working with more than 100 youth throughout the Chicago area. \n   \nCharity was the 49th winner of the Sierra Vista pageant in July, 2015.

Doug Ducey on Thursday defended state laws that let parents use public funds to send children to private and parochial schools. \n   \nBut he sidestepped questions of whether he would sign legislation to open up that possibility to all 1.1 million public school students statewide. \n   \nAt an event at the Capitol, the governor touted what he said is Arizona having \"one of the most robust school choice landscapes in the country.'' \n   \nThat includes an extensive system of charter schools. And Arizona is one of only a handful of states where these can be operated on a for-profit basis. \n   \nBut Arizona also has a system of vouchers - formally called Empowerment Scholarship Accounts - which give parents what amounts to a check of state funds to use to pay tuition at private schools. \n   \nFor the moment, that is limited to students with special needs and foster children as well as those who attend schools rated \"D'' and \"F'' by the Board of Education. But Sen. Debbie Lesko, R-Peoria, is proposing to phase in universal vouchers. \n   \nDucey said he's not bothered by the idea of vouchers. \n   \n\"We've been a leader in school choice,'' he said. \u201cWhat I want a parent to be able to do is send a child to the school of their choice. And when we have opportunities to improve on that, we're going to do that.'' \n   \nDucey did not dispute that state aid to schools is less now on a per-student basis than it was a decade ago. \n   \nBut he pointed out that last year's approval of Proposition 123 will put about $318 million into K-12 education this year. And Ducey has proposed adding another $114 million this coming year in various programs. \n   \n\"So we're headed in the right direction here in Arizona,'' the governor said. \n   \nEven with those Prop 123 dollars, per-student state funding now is $4,528, versus $4,949 a decade ago. And that's before considering the effects of a decade of inflation. \n   \nDucey preferred to focus on what he said is Arizona's student achievement in math and reading increasing faster than any other state. \n   \nThe governor said it is irrelevant that the taxpayer-funded vouchers can be used to send their children to parochial schools where religion can be part of instruction. \n   \n\"I want parents to be able to send kids to the school of their choice,'' he said. \u201cSometimes it's a home school, sometimes it's an alternative to that, but isn't it about what the parent wants and what's best for the child?'' \n   \nHe compared it to health care, saying the focus has to be on the patient and not the provider.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"azcapmedia@gmail.com"},"topics":[],"title":"A parent\u2019s choice","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cochise","zipCode":"85635","state":"Arizona","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Sierra Vista","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sierra Vista Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169805078","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"507"},"name":"Sierra Vista Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.svherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198856383","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:47:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/svherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/79/e79243a8-e5ad-11e6-a93c-db5ab2057019/588d23807f336.image.jpg?resize=300%2C277"}],"video":[]}}

Just ask Italians. \n \nThe immigration wave that has rocked Italy, with nearly 200,000 refugee sea landings last year, has led some Italians to make a false equation: Migrants are all Muslim, and Muslims are all migrants, and they\u2019re flooding the country on wobbly dinghies. According to the latest Perils of Perception survey , carried out by research company Ipsos Mori, Italians believe that Muslims account for 1 in every 5 inhabitants. \n \n In fact, Muslims comprise just 1 out of 25 people living in Italy.  \n \nThis distorted view of Italy\u2019s current ethnic composition is the product of mounting fears around swelling immigration and concern that many illegal migrants could be ISIS terrorists, explains Alfonso Giordano, professor of economic and political geography at LUISS University in Rome. \u201cActually, the number of landings on Italian shores at the start of 2016 was significantly lower than the total landings that occurred in the same period in Greece,\u201d he says. \n \nItalians are near obsessed with the number of Muslims they believe are invading their shores. It\u2019s like a return to the Middle Ages , when Saracen pirates sacked Italian villages, raping and kidnapping female villagers for their harems. As fleets of ships approached the coastline, the most terrifying yell sounding from the lookout towers was \u201c Mamma, li turchi! Mamma, li turchi! \u201d (\u201cMommy, here come the Turks!\u201d) Seems not much has changed since then. Asked about the future, Italians project that by 2020, a third of Italy\u2019s population will be Muslim, while demographic estimates suggest Muslims will represent 5 percent of the population at most. \n  \nTruth is, they have never lived in an open, multiethnic society, in contrast to the Brits and French. \n \nMarco Trepalli, sociologist \n  \nThe Ipsos Mori survey is conducted annually to measure the degree of misperception people have about a number of issues related to where they live and their everyday lives. Italians\u2019 minds seem to be among the most clouded by false notions and data, thanks in part to the kind of \u201cclosed\u201d society in which they live, says Turin-based sociologist Marco Trepalli. \u201cOne thing is an incoming migrant who flees from his country; another is a Muslim who is already living in Italy and well-integrated, perhaps even naturalized. But many Italians make no difference between the two,\u201d he says. \u201cTruth is, they have never lived in an open, multiethnic society, in contrast to the Brits and French.\u201d \n \nAnd, says Giordano, populist leaders \u2014 such as Giorgia Meloni of Fratelli d\u2019Italia group and Matteo Salvini of the Northern League party \u2014 contribute to the growing fear among citizens by portraying all incoming refugees as potential Muslim terrorists. \u201cPopulism talks to the darkest and most hidden fears of people, to their \u2018stomach\u2019 rather than reason, as we say in Italy, with obvious devastating effects,\u201d he observes. \n  \nXenophobic parties like the Northern League have revived the rallying cry \u201c Mamma, li turchi!\u201d \n  \nIt\u2019s not surprising, then, that xenophobic parties like the Northern League have revived the rallying cry \u201cMamma, li turchi!\u201d , while suggesting Italians go so far as to stop \u2014 by force, if necessary \u2014 all migrant boats approaching the country\u2019s southern shores and isles. There have been instances where illegal migrants in Italy have joined the ranks of Islamic extremists. The terrorist who attacked a Christmas market in Berlin in December \u2014 and was subsequently tracked down and killed in Milan \u2014 had traveled to Germany from Italy, where he served a prison sentence for burning down a migrant camp. \n \nAssuming, however, that that was one of the isolated cases of Muslim refugees turning to extreme, violent ends, is it possible to correct Italians\u2019 misreading of their country\u2019s makeup?

Finchem said that should both bring spending under control and make education more affordable. \n   \nFinchem pointed out the Arizona Constitution \"shall be as nearly free as possible.'' Yet tuition for state residents is now north of $11,000, not counting various fees and surcharges. \n   \nFinchem blames it on runaway spending. \n   \n\"The average mid-range business CEO in Arizona is paid a little over $172,000,'' he said Thursday. \"Yet there are hundreds of university staff positions that are paid nearly twice that.'' \n   \nHe provided a list that includes not just administrators but a whole host of faculty positions. But Finchem said he's not convinced that the schools need to be paying that much to anyone, even in the face of arguments that staffers would go elsewhere. \n   \n\"I'm not so sure I want to be competing with Yale and Harvard and Princeton when they can't even teach American history anymore,'' he said. \n   \nThat goes to Finchem's belief that the problems with the universities go beyond money. He also is critical of what is being taught there. \n   \n\"I would like to think that if we want to have people learn critical thinking skills that they not be fed a constant, steady diet of indoctrination,'' he said. \n   \nAcademics aside, Finchem said separate governing boards would force schools to compete for students. And he said that will require each to offer a quality education at the lowest possible cost, meaning the schools will have to cut costs - including staff salaries. \n   \n\"They continue to consume money like it's going out of style,'' he said. \"Enough is enough.'' \n   \nWhile Finchem's solution to the high cost of education is separate governing boards, Sen. Sylvia Allen, R-Snowflake, is pursuing a less-radical approach. \n   \nShe wants to cap year-over-year increases in tuition and mandatory fees at no more than 2 percent. And her SB 1061 also would require each university to offer students a plan where they would be guaranteed no increase for their entire four-year undergraduate career. \n   \nThere are already are options at the University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University. But UA student Michael Finnegan, testifying Thursday on the bill to the Senate Education Committee, said that guarantee is a bit of a joke. \n   \nHe said that does cover tuition and \"mandatory fees.'' But it does not cover special fees charged for certain courses or \"program fees'' which are surcharges for certain programs. \n   \nFor example, Finnegan told lawmakers, a student at the Eller College of Management pays more than $11,000 in tuition. There also are program fees of $900 a semester plus another $1,000 in various other mandatory fees. \n   \n\"Then, on top of that, you're paying for course fees that are for mandatory classes you have to take to graduate,'' Finnegan said. \"It's basically a tax on courses.'' \n   \nAnd he said it's not like students can shop around when a course has such a fee. \n   \nThe measure had been scheduled for a vote Thursday. But Allen, who chairs committee, agreed to a delay to deal with concerns by the regents. \n   \nRegents President Eileen Klein did not dispute the sharp increases in what it costs to get a degree. But she said it is in many ways a direct - and inescapable - effect of legislative actions. \n   \nFigures prepared by legislative budget staffers put state aid to the university system at close to $1.1 billion in the 2007-2008 school year. By last school year the number had dropped to $648 million. \n   \nThere was a small increase this year, to $681.5 million. But some of that is one-time funding that universities cannot count on going forward. \n   \nLooking at it another way, the state's per-student support in 2007-2008 was $9,648. This year it is $4,098. \n   \nAnd if inflation is factored in, the number is close to $3,500. \n   \nThe result was a series of sharp hikes in tuition, some in the 20 percent raise. Klein told members of the Education Committee Thursday that her board now has a better handle on things. \n   \n\"Gone are the days of double-digit tuition increases,'' she said. \n   \nKlein warned Allen of potential problems if schools have to live with both a cap on tuition hikes and giving students the option of a fixed tuition for four years. \n   \nOne, she said, would be to instill a philosophy of \"grow or die'' with the schools, promoting ever-larger enrollment to cover fixed costs. Klein said the other would be for schools to always implement the maximum increase allowed by law - even if they don't immediately need it - to ensure they have the cash for years when costs go up more than the permitted tuition hike. \n   \nBut Finchem disagrees with the idea that the universities don't have enough money. Nor is he dissuaded by the sharp drop in state support, believed to be the largest on a percentage basis in the whole country. \n   \n\"Apparently, they're doing just fine because they're paying people like it's going out of style,'' he said. \n   \nFinchem said separate boards would also recognize that enrollment will not continue to increase - nor should it. He said attendance at a state university should require some competition to get into the limited number of spaces, as occurs in some other countries, versus continued expansion. \n   \n\"Endless building, endless capital projects rob from the taxpayer, especially when we need to redirect those funds to K-12, to better educate the kids who should be competing for college,'' he said. \n   \nKlein, for her part, said she believes that reducing the regents to a mere advisory role would effectively give more authority to university presidents to spend at will. And she dismissed the idea that each school's separate governing board would provide sufficient oversight, saying the board would be \"nothing more than community cheerleaders.'' \n   \nShe also said there will be \"massive replication and duplication as the universities all try to fend for themselves.''","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"azcapmedia@gmail.com"},"topics":[],"title":"\u2018Out of control\u2019 spending leads to proposed governing board","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cochise","zipCode":"85635","state":"Arizona","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Sierra Vista","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sierra Vista Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169805078","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"507"},"name":"Sierra Vista Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.svherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198860947","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:47:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/svherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/ad/3add03e8-e5ab-11e6-b71f-87e4f048926b/588d2086b8648.image.jpg?resize=300%2C270"}],"video":[]}}

I enjoy the kid's work. \n \n``I am obviously still in a process of getting to know him and spending more time with him in training and working together, but I have enjoyed seeing his work. He has nice qualities.'' \n \nNicholson is now free to talk to other clubs and Rangers have been credited with an interest. \n \nBut when asked about the wide player's contract situation, Cathro said: ``We can maybe look at those things further down the line but I am just getting to know him. \n \n``He is just coming back from an injury, which was his main focus.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 20 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"40202","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Louisville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Louisville Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"540"},"name":"Louisville Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198865270","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:47:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2590","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Cootamundra","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Harden Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"270762332","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Harden Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hardenexpress.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198872336","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:47:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Displaying great commitment during practise and focussing on the next game. Although he savoured the achievements of the past, those were shut off from his mind. \n \nOnly the future mattered. In this instance, it was the Twenty20 game against Tamil Nadu on Sunday. It was here, during the fifth Test against England in December, 2016, that the 25-year-old set the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium alight with a blistering unbeaten innings of 303. \n \nThis ground will always be close to Karun\u2019s heart. He relishes the smell of the sea, and the freshness in the air. \n \nKarun said, about the great venue, here on Saturday, \u201cI like how open the ground is and how much space there is between the stands.\u201d \n \nIndeed, when he cut loose during the second phase of his triple century, the gaps between fielders appeared as large as those between the stands. \n \nDisplaying his liking for the stadium at Chepauk, Karun said, \u201cThe sea breeze flows in. It cools things down in the middle. There is a feeling of freedom.\u201d Karun, though, certainly made things hot for the Englishmen. \n \nThe belief shown in him by skipper Virat Kohli has played a key role in the development of Karun. The youngster from Karnataka said, \u201cHe has backed me just as he has backed all the players. Kohli thinks about taking the team forward.\u201d \n \nKarun added, \u201cWhat I like most about Kohli are his work ethics. He does lead by example.\u201d \n \nDravid\u2019s role \n \nAnother man who has donned a pivotal role in blossoming of Karun\u2019s career has been Rahul Dravid, from his formative years in Karnataka, to the Rajasthan Royals side, to the India \u2018A\u2019 team. \n \nKarun acknowledged the contribution made by the legend in his cricketing journey. \u201cHe has been immensely supportive. Rahul sir gave me the license to go out there and express myself freely. That really helped me evolve as a cricketer.\u201d \n \nThe middle-order batsman said he did not set goals for himself, and was heartened by words of praise for his batting by Australia captain Steven Smith. He said surviving a drowning scare in Kerala last year changed his outlook towards life. \n \nFor Karun, every day brings with it possibilities. It\u2019s a new beginning.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Kohli has backed me like he has all players, says Karun","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"The Hindu","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169592117","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"917"},"name":"The Hindu","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Cricket","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hindu.com","publisher":"The Hindu Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198872700","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:42:35Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:47:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"caption":"Karun Nair. \u2014 Photo: V.

The \u201csanitised\u201d report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). \n \nThe report, whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986. \n \nThe very first sentence of the report\u2019s available (undeleted) page reads: \u201cPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\u201d It, however, later clearly said that \u201cassassination is the major near-term threat\u201d to him. \n \nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991. \n \nThe first section titled \u201cKey Judgments\u201d analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India\u2019s relations with the US, the then USSR and the region. \n \nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi\u2019s life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder. \n \n\u201cIf Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures \u2014 including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India \u2014 were taken by the Indian President ......

Singh, who could be the \u201cinterim successor\u201d and \u201clikely candidates\u201d in case of sudden exit by Rajiv. Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991. \n \nIn a section, titled \u2018The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy\u2019, the report says \u201cIn our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\u201d besides \u201ca fanatical Hindu\u201d. \n \nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2590","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Cootamundra","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Harden Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"270762332","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Harden Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hardenexpress.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198874076","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:47:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

She keeps candy on hand for children who come into the pantry to make them smile, she said.  \n   \n\"We are here to help families with food, pray for them, give them the word and just to have compassion,\" said Stacker. \"We don't look down on people when they have a need. I know how I felt the first time I came in and asked for help. I didn't want to do it, it was embarrassing.\" \n   \nStacker began volunteering 17 years ago after needing assistance herself during during a personal crisis and health issues.  \n   \n\"I started coming in to get some help for a light bill,\" said Stacker. \"I came back to see if I could volunteer and hanging up clothes and stuff, then about two years ago, after I got over some health issues I came and started volunteering over here with the food.\" \n   \nStacker worked for Coty for 16 years and had to quit after she hurt her back in 1994. Her rough patch began after a divorce roughly 20 years ago that made her a single parent of three children and in need of help, she said.  \n   \n\"I really needed that help and then when I came to the Salvation Army and I met Pam Hooker,\" said Stacker. \"We started talking and she really encouraged me. I didn't want to come in and get help but I needed help. We started a friendship right then and there and she encouraged me. We been talking ever since, we are prayer partners, we just encourage one another.\" \n   \nThrough her experience at the Salvation Army, Stacker has realized her passion for helping others the way Hooker helped her, she said.  \n   \n\"If I needed help, somebody else needed help and also that encouragement,\" said Stacker. \"I love doing it, I love giving back to the community, I love helping people and it just touches me to give back.\" \n   \nA particular interaction with a stranger at the Salvation Army inspired her to keep volunteering and working to reach out to those in need, she said.  \n   \nStacker overheard a conversation while turkey's were handed out during the holiday season where a young woman was explaining to others her illnesses. After everyone left, Stacker asked the young lady if she would like to pray with her and she did.  \n   \n\"Before I started praying I told her how God healed my body,\" said Stacker.  \n   \nRoughly 17 years ago, Stacker was diagnosed with a spinal infection that should have claimed her life and at very least left her paralyzed, said Stacker.  \n   \nAfter an evening church service Stacker went to bed with a headache. The next day she went to the emergency room where she was given shots and sent home. The next morning she could not get up and her parents took her to the hospital.  \n   \n\"I could hear the doctors saying that my body was shutting down,\" said Stacker. \"I was dying and they didn't know what was going on, it was a terrifying moment.\" \n   \nStacker is a member of Christian Mission of Hope and recalls the prayers she prayed in her hospital bed that gave her the strength to carry on. \n   \n\"It was my faith that healed me,\" said Stacker. \"While I was in the hospital I would look at the window and I told the Lord, if you take care of the animals, you said you'd take care of me, you said you'd never leave me nor forsake me. If I never walk again it's alright but my prayer was that I wanted to hold my first grandbaby. He touched my body and I was able to hold him, he's 17 now we have a bond, I have a bond with all of them, but especially with him.\" \n   \nDuring physical therapy, Stacker had to relearn how to walk, feed and bathe herself, which was a humbling experience for her, she said. \n   \n\"It really humbled me because you're use to doing things yourself and all of a sudden you can't do it,\" said Stacker.  \n   \nAfter completing physical therapy, Stacker was able to walk out of the hospital and is thankful for every day, she said.  \n   \n\"They have in my records that it's a miracle, they said I wasn't supposed to be here,\" said Stacker. \"Now I don't take it for granted, walking, talking, living, breathing. I have compassion for others going through sickness and ailments. Just living life I don't take it for granted.\" \n   \nWhile Stacker is stocking the shelves and packing bags at the Salvation Army she often overhears people coming in asking for help who are often embarrassed, she said.  \n   \n\"A lady came in who had never been in before and she kept apologizing,\" said Stacker. \"I came around the corner and said, \"Ma'am do you mind if I hug you?\" and she said, \"No I don't.\" \n   \nStacker hugged the woman and gave her words of encouragement.   \n   \n\"I hugged her and said,\"Baby, it's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok, don't worry about it\",\" said Stacker. \"She calmed right down and I prayed with her, something in her just lifted up.\" \n   \nThe hardest thing for Stacker to see is young people who come in who might be addicted to drugs. She wonders what more can be done and prays for them and prays while she is touching the food, she said.  \n   \n\"I hear different people's problems and I wonder what can I do to give back and how can I help them,\" said Stacker. \"If it's nothing but sitting and listening to them, if they have problems or issues, just by being a listener and letting them talk and praying with people and trying to encourage them. I tell them not to give up to hold on and to know that God is there and he will help you, no matter what you're going through.\" \n   \nWhen Stacker is not volunteering, her passion is baking and decorating cakes, teaching people how to make cakes and spending time with her family. She has remarried and has eight grandchildren who she bakes with. She is also a minister who visits nursing homes and delivers sermons and words of encouragement, she said.  \n   \n\"We all come to a point where we need help,\" said Stacker. \"You've got to humble yourself and say, \"Ok, I need this\". It was embarrassing when I needed help not only with the light bill but with food because I had growing kids but you got to humble yourself.\" \n   \nReach Staff Writer Michelle Bir at 919-718-1229.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Hometown Heroes: Food pantry volunteer offers free hugs","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lee","zipCode":"27330","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Sanford","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sanford Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"175661709","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"225"},"name":"Sanford Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sanfordherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198876940","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:47:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

 Business News Share the joy \n                                 \nAs per the Global Auto Report released by Scotiabank in January 2017, global car sales are likely to be on the upward rising curve for a record eighth consecutive year. Car sales saw a sharp increase globally in the final months of 2016, which is a good indicator of what is to come in the present year for the auto industry. \n \nThe United States and Western Europe is likely to see an increased demand in terms of replacement, while the emerging markets will see a rise, contrary to declining sales as noticed in the past years. However, China is expected to show lesser growth , i.e. only about one percent in comparison to the six percent rise in 2016. \n \nGlobal Car Sales Statistics In 2016      \n \nThe statistics for 2016 shed a light on car sales in the previous year. By looking into them, interested people may know as to how automobile companies fared and which cars stole the show in the global car market. \n \nThe best-selling car was the Toyota Corolla, notching up a massive 946,000 units in sales. The Corolla was followed by the Volkswagen Golf (740,000), Ford F-Series (739,000), Ford Focus (564,000), and the Hyundai Elantra (555,000). These cars made the top half of the highest sales list. \n \nHowever, things change a bit when you look at the biggest manufacturer list. Volkswagen topped this list, producing over 10.1 million units in the previous year. In second place is Toyota, having produced 9.95 million units in the year. Renault-Nissan produced 8.51 million units and took the third spot, followed by Kia Motors and Hyundai in fourth place (8.17 million units). General Motors wound up the top half with 7.97 million units. \n \nThe remaining five cars in the highest selling chart are the Volkswagen Polo (549,000), Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Toyota Camry and the Honda Civic. On a similar note, Ford, Honda, Fiat Chrysler, PSA Peugeot Citroen and Suzuki make up the final five of the biggest manufacturers list. \n \nOne interesting thing to note is the discrepancy at the top of both the lists. While Toyota tops the sales list in the form of the Corolla, the biggest manufacturer spot is occupied by the German major Volkswagen. \n \nFinally, when we take a look at the international car sales, we get a total of 75.24 million units sold. China took top spot , selling 23.2 million, followed by the US (17.5 million units), Germany (3.32 million units), India (2.12 million units) and Canada (1.96 million units). The last three spots are occupied by Mexico, Brazil and Russia. \n \nYou can check out www.bestcarsau.com to keep the conversation ongoing about cars.

He also worked on Trump\u2019s speech to the annual conference   of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  ( AIPAC) in March 2016. \n David Friedman (L) with Donald Trump, and his daughter, Ivanka Trump  \nDavid Friedman: US   ambassador to Israel   \n \nTrump has appointed Friedman to serve as ambassador to Israel. Friedman has previously expressed support for Israeli\u2019s illegal settlements, and funded construction in the occupied territories. He has even expressed doubt about the future of the two-state solution. \n \nFriedman, who speaks Hebrew, has decided to live in his own personal apartment in al-Quds (Jerusalem) rather than residing in the Ambassador's Residence in Herzliya. \n \nStephen Miller: Senior adviser   \n \nMiller, who has described himself as \u201ca practicing Jew,\u201d has played a key role in Trump\u2019s campaign by writing his speeches for rallies. The thirty-one-year-old joined the Trump campaign in early 2016.  \n \nJason Greenblatt:   Special representative   \n \nTrump has appointed Greenblatt to work as special representative for international negotiations focusing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well as US-Cuba ties and American trade agreements with other countries. \n \nGreenblatt has long been chief legal officer for the Trump Organization. He studied at West Bank Yeshiva University in the mid-1980s and did armed guard duty in the occupied territories. \n President Donald Trump (right) and his special representative Jason Greenblatt  \nGary Cohn: Top Economic adviser   \n \nCohn is walking away from a career at Goldman Sachs to head the White House National Economic Council with   a salary of $285 million.  \n \nSteven Mnuchin: Treasury secretary   \n \nMnuchin, who worked as Trump\u2019s national finance chairman during the campaign, serves as Treasury Secretary.

Since then, travellers from those countries have been stopped from boarding US-bound planes, triggering angry protests and detentions at airports. \n\nSome who were already in the air when Trump signed the executive order were detained on arrival, The New York Times reported. \n\nOn Saturday, Canadian airline WestJet said it would reimburse passengers prevented from travelling to the United States under the new policy. \n\n\"WestJet will comply with this executive order,\" the company said in a statement. \n\n\"In the event, there are foreign nationals from these countries on WestJet who are denied entry, we will be providing them with a full refund.\" \n\nThe airliner has already had to refuse one passenger transport to the United States, a spokeswoman said, without specifying the passenger's origin.

In their view, Moi was politically ill-equipped for the top job and did not have the confidence of the powerbrokers in the government of Kenyatta. The memo completely writes off Jaramogi Oginga Odinga\u2019s chances as \"improbable\". Jaramogi, the father of the current Opposition leader Raila Odinga, was then a political pariah, and according to the CIA, he was being isolated by the \"Kikuyu establishment\".\n\nThe frontrunners, the spy agency said, were Njoroge Mungai, then foreign minister, a darling of the President\u2019s inner circle, JM Kariuki, a popular and populist politician, whose daughter Rosemary works for Raila\u2019s party ODM; and Mwai Kibaki, whom according to the CIA, was \"gaining ground as a compromise candidate\". Kibaki finally ruled Kenya for a decade until 2013.\n\nJM Kariuki was the CIA\u2019s pick. \"In a free election for the presidency, Kariuki would give Moi a good fight and probably outdistance Mungai,\" the CIA said in the memo. ALSO Fellow tribesmen\n\nIf the worst came to the worst, the CIA predicted a military coup, and even says it would work because \"Kenyatta and his associates\" had packed the military with \"fellow tribesmen\".\n\n\"If the succession is marked by prolonged political squabbling and unrest, the chances for military intervention will increase markedly,\" the American spies reported to their boss. Titled \u2018The Post-Kenyatta Conundrum\u2019 the intelligence memo is just one of the dozens of documents that lift the veil on how the US viewed Kenya and its leaders just nine years after independence. The worry of the American spies, in that memo, was that if Kenyatta\u2019s successor did not come from his inner circle, Kenya was likely to vote with the communists in international fora, and that was a big headache for the US. In their predictions, Moi was going to be a puppet of the cabal around Kenyatta, and within the 90 days, a suitable candidate would have been found to take over. In their books, they had Mungai, whom they describe as \"Kenyatta\u2019s personal physician, nephew and close advisor\". CIA\u2019s only problem was that Mungai was only popular in Gatundu.\n\n\"He enjoys little popularity outside his own constituency,\" the memo to the Director of Central Intelligence, stamped \u2018secret\u2019 says.\n\nPolitical skills\n\nBut Moi\u2019s chances were dismissed. \"Moi as President might be little more than a figurehead, with real power resting in the Kikuyu inner circle. Despite his standing with Kenyatta, the vice president has never enjoyed the full confidence of the Gatundu group or participated extensively in its decision-making sessions. Moreover, he appears to lack the necessary political skills and sufficient backing to challenge the Kikuyu hegemony,\" the memo said.\n\nIt added: \"Moi would be legally blocked from making any significant changes while acting president, and therefore his chances to consolidate his position during his 90 days in office would be limited. The absence of formal constitution or party provisions for nominating a candidate to succeed Kenyatta as president strongly suggests the matter will be resolved in the Kikuyu inner circle. The Kikuyu may see Moi as useful in a transition period and might even support him in the election, but Moi\u2019s prospects for political longevity will diminish as the Kikuyu increase their political strength.\" ALSO That assessment from the CIA dovetails perfectly with the recordings in Moi\u2019s biography \u2018Moi: The Making of an African Statesman\u2019 which said that many of the powerbrokers of the Kenyatta era saw Moi as a \"passing cloud\" and actively worked to ensure that he doesn\u2019t assume the presidency.\n\nBut a student of Kenyatta, and having worked as vice president for 11 years when Kenyatta died, Moi appears to have learned a lot about the psychology of power and the mechanics of politics, to an extent that he proved the CIA analysts wrong \u2013 he went on to rule Kenya for 24 years.\n\nIn fact, even the then powerful Attorney General Charles Njonjo is quoted in Moi\u2019s biography giving credence to the \"figurehead\" portrait that the CIA had predicted, by saying, if the cabal around President Kenyatta had wanted to block Moi\u2019s presidency, they would have done it \"so easily\".\n\n\"I was Attorney General, the Commissioner of Police (Bernard Hinga) was Kikuyu, the Director of Intelligence was Kikuyu, the head of the GSU was Kikuyu, the senior officers in the Army and the Air Force were Kikuyus. If we wanted to organise something different, and not follow the Constitution, we were in a position to do it,\" reads Moi\u2019s biography. What these people overlooked was that with Moi as President, there was a lot he could do, both within government and within the then ruling party Kanu, to strengthen his position, and ensure he is elected President. Moi did exactly that.\n\nAbout Kibaki, the CIA said he was not ambitious, but felt that if the worst came to the worst, the cabal around Kenyatta would settle on him.\n\n\"Kibaki seems acceptable to both the northern (Nyeri) and southern (Kiambu) and, like Kariuki, is popular among non-Kikuyu tribes. Kibaki also is an intelligent, talented, and energetic administrator. So far, however, he has shown little desire to compete for the presidency, and he generally shies away from back-room maneuverings,\" the memo noted.\n\nFor Raila\u2019s father, who was in the cold, the CIA said he appeared to have \"lost much of his support\", but still noted that he retained considerable clout as a kingmaker. Odinga was the independence vice president, but he fell out with Kenyatta. ALSO Kikuyu establishment\n\n\"Oginga Odinga no longer appears to have much chance. As a result of his detention, he appears to have lost much of his support. Odinga had hopes of a government post, but so far Kenyatta has refused to have anything to do with him. Odinga does retain a residue of popularity throughout the country among the economically discontented and he could swing support to someone like Kariuki. It is improbable, however, that Kikuyu establishment, which has been encouraging dissension among the Luo by pushing Odinga\u2019s rivals, would permit the former vice president to re-enter the political arena,\" the memo concluded.\n\nIt is here that the CIA also noted the possibility of a military coup, and said that while Major General Jackson Mulinge, the army commander and the senior military officer, seems inclined to preserve the military\u2019s non-political image, there was trouble brewing underneath.\n\n\"The incessant maneuvering and the uncertainty over succession as well as the obvious attempts by the Gatundu group to advance their fellow tribesmen in the military, are slowly eroding this stand, and tribal enmity within the military is increasing. Top officers, particular those from the Kamba tribe, are wary of the Kikuyu ascendancy\u2026There has been more grumbling over government corruption and tribal favourisitm, but for the most part, this has been confined to the barracks and mess halls,\" they said,\n\nWhile noting that Maj.Gen Mulinge was \"loyal\" and had \"no political ambitions\", they said, if the military did not intervene to kick out Moi, then, the General Service Unit was likely to be the force that would execute the overthrow of government, and then keep the military at bay. \"Kenyatta and his associates, well aware of the political potential of the military have deliberately recruited more and more Kikuyu into the military. They can also rely on the paramilitary police force, the General Service Unit, to discourage a military coup. This well-equipped and well-trained unit has important elements stationed near the capital and is almost wholly Kikuyu. Although the 1,600-man General Service Unit is outnumbered by the 5,000-man army, the paramilitary force could hold its own in a fight with the regular military. Kenyatta has attempted to retain this parity by preventing the army\u2019s acquisition of some modern weapons,\" the memo warned.\n\nIn the end, the CIA said that whoever takes over was likely to run into political headwinds.\n\n\"Regardless of who follows Kenyatta, there doubtless will be some changes. Without Kenyatta\u2019s strong hand and towering presence the new government is likely to be troubled by maneuvering, division, and threats to its position that could bring on more repressive domestic policies. The new administration will probably also come under increasing pressures as a result of domestic problems. The Kenyatta government has taken little action to deal with the high rate of population growth and rising unemployment and the pace of land redistribution has been slow,\" it concluded.\n\nWhile the CIA correctly predicted a coup attempt, it got the culprits wrong. The August 1, 1982, coup attempt was led by Kenya Air Force soldiers, not GSU officers are anticipated earlier.

Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State, explained that the importance of Kano economy necessitated a new thinking. \nAmaechi said: \u201cI think the President is doing that because the economy of Kano is also large in the country and that, between Kano and Lagos, we have about a total of 30 million tons of freight, and that will help in conveying some of them to Abuja, while we extend the construction to Lagos\u201d. \nThe Transport Minister said that already, the Federal Government was negotiating with China EXIM Bank and it was expected that the negotiation would end this year, to pave way for work on the project to commence. \nAmeachi further revealed that the Lagos \u2013 Kano rail (narrow gauge) would have more locomotives, before June 2017, stressing: \u201cWe are trying to bring in about 100 locomotives to move between Lagos \u2013 Kano \u2013 Funtua and Port Harcourt \u2013 Gombe\u201d. The flurry of activities around this initiative, he noted, would greatly impact on Kano and reverberate on the national economy. \nRead more at: http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/01/fg-earmarks-1-2b-for-kano-kaduna-rail-line/ Original Article \n \nFG Earmarks $1.2b For Kano-Kaduna Rail Line - Amaechi \nFG Earmarks $1.2b For Kano-Kaduna Rail Line - Amaechi \nFG Earmarks $1.2b For Kano-Kaduna Rail Line - Amaechi \nFG Earmarks $1.2b For Kano-Kaduna Rail Line - Amaechi \nFG Earmarks $1.2b For Kano-Kaduna Rail Line - Amaechi \n FG Earmarks $1.2b For Kano-Kaduna Rail Line - Amaechi  FG Earmarks $1.2b For Kano-Kaduna Rail Line - Amaechi","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[{"name":"Rail transport news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Transportation industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"FG Earmarks $1.2b For Kano-Kaduna Rail Line \u2013 Amaechi","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Akwa Ibom State News Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608972085","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Akwa Ibom State News Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://akwaibomstatenews.online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/01/fg-earmarks-1-2b-for-kano-kaduna-rail-line/","http://www.nairaland.com/3598816/fg-earmarks-1.2b-kano-kaduna-rail"],"sequenceId":"695198898536","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:38:30Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:47:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 19 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Palm Beach","zipCode":"33410","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"West Palm Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WPBF","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664683","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"130"},"name":"WPBF","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wpbf.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198899546","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:47:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But we are still managing to feed all 230, because you can\u2019t deny any of them of it. \n\u201cWe have fed them for five days, remaining five more days which will end next week.

Hickman and Giles completed the top three. \n\nWith the event again going down to the wire, Australia sensed a sniff of victory after Hickman high-sided out of the lead at turn 10 on lap two, with McWilliams dropping a couple of places as he took evasive action. \n\nHowever, with Aussie hard-charger Chad Hern (Harris Honda) out on the following lap with a broken cam chain it was then obvious only a calamity from a UK perspective would let Australia back into the game. \n\nThat didn't eventuate, but the last few laps of race four were the best of the weekend as Phillis led while McWilliams was on a comeback mission after being held up in the Hickman crash. \n\nThe final lap was a nerve-jangler, and just when it appeared McWilliams was ready to make a move he got all loose a turn 10 which scuppered his chances of a clean sweep. \n\n\"I just went in too hot and the bike stepped out,\" said McWilliams. \"Alex is also exceptionally fast at turn 11 \u2013 and also at turns two and six for that matter! - so I knew that was it for me as far as pushing for the win.\" \n\nPhillis was elated, as he completed his rookie International Challenge campaign in the best possible way. \n\n\"I knew Jeremy was close behind so I just had to stay focussed and get on the gas as hard as I could coming out of turn 10 on that last lap,\" said Alex, the son of Aussie superbike racing legend, Robbie. \"I have really enjoyed riding the XR69, and I knew that once we had ironed out a few fuelling niggles I would give myself a great chance of pushing for a win. \n\n\"I also got a great start in the last race, so that always helps.\" \n\nPhillis only finished 11th overall in the individual standings after his race one DNF, with McWilliams running out an easy winner on 159pts from Metcher (147), Giles (147), Ireland's Paul Byrne (McIntosh Suzuki, 140), UK's Conor Cummins (Harris Yamaha, 133), Martin (132), Ireland's Derek Sheils (XR69, 132), and another batch of UK riders: McGuinness (Harris Honda, 125), James Hillier (Harris Yamaha, 118) and Hickman (116). \n\nThe highest point-scorer for America was Pat Mooney (XR69) in a 12th position, and for New Zealand it was Glenn Hindle (XR69) in 12th position. \n\nIrish non-riding captain Mike Meskell was delighted with how his team performed. \n\n\"We had some good bikes and some not so good this weekend, but they held together and we have achieved our goal of getting closer to the top two teams,\" Meskell said. \"We want to be regarded as a serious competitor to Australia and the UK, and we will come back bigger and stronger in 2018 with better bikes, including two XR69s.\" \n\nAmerican head honcho Dave Crussell said: Our bikes and riders finished every single race in 2017, which is a fantastic achievement. Our bike development has paid off, and I was particularly delighted with the form of Pat Mooney and Barrett Long.\" \n\nDespite again holding up the International Challenge ladder, New Zealand captain Duncan Coutts was far from despondent. \n\n\"We were a bit unlucky in that last race with Damien (Kavney) a DNF, but a couple of our bikes were really strong and we'll be back to fight on again in 2017,\" Coutts said. \n\nIn a massive weekend of historic competition, Murray Seabrook collected the Phil Irving Memorial Trophy for the most points collected by a competitor outside the International Challenge races. Seabrook defeated Dean Oughtred and Lachlan Hill. \n\nINTERNATIONAL CHALLENGE RACE RESULTS \n\nRace one: 1 Jeremy McWilliams (UK), 2 Shawn Giles (AUS), 3 Peter Hickman (UK), 4 Conor Cummins (UK), 5 Jed Metcher (AUS), 6 Chas Hern (AUS). \n\nRace two: 1 McWilliams, 2 Hickman, 3 Metcher, 4 Alex Phillis (AUS), 5 Paul Byrne (IRE), 6 Giles. \n\nRace three: 1 McWilliams, 2 Hickman, 3 Giles, 4 Phillis, 5 Metcher, 6 Byrne \n\nRace four: 1 Phillis, 2 McWilliams, 3 Steve Martin (AUS), 4 Metcher, 5 Byrne, 6 Giles. \n\nINTERNATIONAL CHALLENGE FINAL STANDINGS \n\n1.

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n \nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen. Tashfeen Malik was from a family of wealthy landowners in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia with her immediate family. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a US citizen. \n \nPakistan and Saudi Arabia, however, are not on the list of countries subject to the new ban. \n \nThe administration is facing criticism from leaders in the U.S. and around the world for taking steps their critics say are unconstitutional and anti-American. \n \nThe second mention of San Bernardino came when the official was trying to explain why there was no grace period before the executive order went into effect, to help ease implementation. \n \n\"Imagine if this had been an executive order that had been contemplated the day before the San Bernardino shooter entered the United States?\" the official asked. \"Would have delaying its implementation served the best interests of the country? The reality is we don't know who the next individual is who will exploit our immigration programs successfully. If you choose that something is necessary to do for the sake of national security, it should be done immediately.\" \n \n© Distributed by LAKANA.

It should be seen as an opportunity to highlight all the hard work you have done in a year. There should be enthusiasm and zest. It is your decision to treat as a pleasure or pressure. Those who treat it as a pleasure will gain and those who treat it as pressure will repent.\n\n\"My view is that examination is a celebration. Take it as if it is a festival. And when there is a festival or celebration, then the best comes out of us. We feel the society's strength during celebrations. Whatever is the best comes out... Smile more to score more,\" he said.\n\nHe gave the example of discipline seen among masses in 'kumbh' fair even though it is generally felt that there is a lot of indiscipline among people. \"This is the strength of celebration.\" \n\nDuring examination, there should be a festive atmosphere among students, families and neighbours and it will convert this pressure into pleasure.\n\nHe also asked people to put examination in perspective and not treat it as \"a question of life and death or as a test of life but merely of the study students have put in during the year\".\n\nHe urged students not to chase marks but gain knowledge.\n\n\"Only studying for marks will lead to shortcuts and one will limit himself or herself. It is important to study for knowledge. Marks and marksheetd have a limited use. Knowledge, skill, self-confidence and commitment will be of use to you during life,\" Modi said.\n\nHe have the example of late President A P J Abdul Kalam's failure in an air force recruitment examination and said had he accepted it as a defeat, then India would not have got such a great scientist and President.\n\nHe also asked students to desist from resorting to shortcuts and cheating to score more.\n\n\"To cheat is to be cheap. It makes you a bad person. If you form a habit of cheating, there will be no desire to learn. Trying to cheat involves one's time to find ways. Use it for better purposes. People have told you often but I am saying again -- do not cheat. Even if no one catches you, you know that you have cheated in exams,\" he said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Smile more to score more: PM to students, parents ahead of exam season","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Press Trust of India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169699931","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2055"},"name":"Press Trust of India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ptinews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198909894","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:47:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \nReleased under special circumstances \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n'The executive order is unlawful' \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \nLegality questioned \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \n© Distributed by LAKANA.

But in Trump\u2019s statements, he claimed that the move would have no cost at all \u2014 a statement that rankled some economists. \n \n\u201cThere will be advantages to companies that do indeed make their products here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve always said, by the time you put them in these massive ships or airplanes and fly them and \u2014 I think it\u2019s going to be cheaper.\u201d \n \nEconomists disagreed. Though some said the policy could benefit some American workers by creating jobs and in turn expanding the U.S. economy, most said it would also impose a greater cost on companies, who would in turn pass those costs on to consumers. Either consumers would buy goods made in the U.S., which would be more expensive due to the higher cost of American wages, or they would buy foreign goods that would be pricier because they had been subject to an additional tax. \n  \nRelated Articles January 28, 2017   The Latest: Source says foreign-born US residents can return   January 28, 2017   Iranian couple, Syrian mother and baby stopped at DIA as protesters rallied in main terminal against new policy   January 28, 2017   Trump order barring refugees, migrants from Muslim countries causes chaos, outrage   January 28, 2017   Trump, Putin discuss \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d trade, security   January 28, 2017   Protesters, immigration attorneys gather at DIA in protest of Donald Trump\u2019s ban on refugees from Muslim countries   \u201cCompanies of course have these international supply chains because it makes it cheaper for them to produce their products. So almost inevitably, if you don\u2019t let them do that, their products will become more expensive for consumers,\u201d said Stan Veuger, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cFor sure it\u2019s going to increase prices.\u201d \n \nJust how much prices would increase if more goods are made in America is unclear, but it could be substantial. Research firm IHS Technology has estimated that producing an iPhone domestically might inflate its cost to as much as $2,000. As Business Insider has pointed out, U.S.-made jeans by Levi and JCrew range from 40 to 170 percent more than foreign-made styles. The same is true of a range of products, from shoes to solar panels. \n \nThe ultimate price increase would likely be determined by two factors, economists said. One is how much the high cost of American wages would factor into the goods final price. For some products that require a lot of human labor, like clothing or shoes, the cost of worker wages represents a big chunk of the final price. For others, it\u2019s less significant. \n \nThe other factor is the likelihood that a worker in any given industry would be replaced by a robot. Some jobs, for example auto manufacturing, can be automated more easily. Economists like Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics says that if companies are forced to bring facilities back to the U.S., we\u2019re likely to see much more automation. \n  \n\u201cIf [manufacturers] can\u2019t lower costs by producing in other countries, they\u2019ll lower their costs by producing with fewer workers, figuring out ways to automate the making of their products,\u201d Bown says. \n \nCompanies that can automate might be able to keep costs low even if they bring facilities back to the U.S., says Bown. But in that case, the ultimate benefit for U.S. workers might be negligible. \n \nFor Veuger and Bown, these dynamics create a paradox at the heart of Trump\u2019s job plan. If more products are made by American workers, prices will rise for American consumers. If prices don\u2019t rise for American consumers, it\u2019s because the products are being made not by American workers, but by robots. \n \n\u201cIf we\u2019re worried about the manufacturing blue collar worker that\u2019s non-educated, this does nothing to help them \u2026 So no, I don\u2019t see any benefits. I would much prefer to directly attack the problems facing those workers,\u201d Bown says. \n \nNot all economists agree. William Spriggs, chief economist at the AFL-CIO, says that of course manufacturing jobs that return to American shores would be less labor intensive \u2014 but that would be a good thing, since working conditions in places like China are too inferior to American standards. \n \n\u201cI would want it to be automated and high productivity work with high wages,\u201d he said. Offshoring did have a substantial impact on undermining the manufacturing industry in the last two decades, and coaxing production back could help reverse that, Spriggs said. \n \nEconomists also widely disagreed with Trump\u2019s claim that the greater cost of manufacturing in the U.S. would be offset by lower costs for transporting products by ship or airplane around the world. \u201cIf that were the case, then they would already be produced in the U.S. Presumably, companies realize that they are paying transportation costs when they bring stuff in from abroad,\u201d said Veuger. \n \nWhile shipping costs are substantial for some heavier items like steel, for many consumer products transportation costs make up a far smaller percentage of the final cost than worker wages.

But with the numbers of both regular and homeless visitors growing, there is a need to balance the needs of both populations. \n \nRelated Articles January 25, 2017   Johnson & Wales students join United States Holocaust Museum project to learn what Denver knew about Nazis and when   Two years ago, library leaders initiated a program to pre-empt behavioral issues that can impact staff and patrons, hiring two licensed clinical social workers. In January, the library added three part-time \u201cpeer navigators\u201d to help provide referrals and free up social workers for more complex interactions. \n \nDubbed community resource specialists, the social workers served 1,265 people last year, referring many to help with housing, substance abuse and mental health treatment, and other services. A service target for this year is 1,620 customers, with 405 of them being juveniles, library spokesman Chris Henning said. \n \n\u201cThey have been able to intercede in some situations which would have required a police call or someone being bounced from the library,\u201d library security manager Bob Knowles said. \n \nHowever, a hoped-for decline in calls for police and other emergency responders didn\u2019t materialize during the same period, Henning said. \n \nCalls to Denver Police jumped 93 percent to 83 from 43 during the period. Calls to other responders for medical emergencies or to take someone to detox, or the fire department for other problems jumped 40.3 percent above 2015 totals, Henning said. \u201cThe mitigating factor on this has been the influx of new and displaced customers experiencing homelessness, as well as a general increase in library visitors.\u201d \n \nWinter is especially difficult for those on the street and weather influences the number who take refuge in the library. Recent sweeps of homeless encampments also produced noticeable temporary jumps in the population. \n \nAndy Cross, The Denver Post Angie, checks text messages in the Denver Central Library. Angie, a homeless woman, came into the library to warm up and use library resources. Andy Cross, The Denver Post For years, staffers have fielded questions from people who wanted to know where they could go to get a meal, sleep for the night, find housing, or apply for food stamps or other services. \n \n\u201cThey felt they were just being reactionary, rather than helping,\u201d said Elissa Hardy, one of the library\u2019s social workers. \n \nLibrary staff did some research and found that library systems in Washington and San Francisco had social workers on staff. The library\u2019s Homeless Services Action Committee recommended hiring a social worker, and Hardy joined the staff. \n \n\u201cAfter one year, we proved the need for this,\u201d Hardy said. The Denver City Council in 2016 approved hiring a second full-time social worker, Kristi Schaefer. \n \nThe navigators, all of whom have wrestled with their own substance abuse or mental health problems and are now in recovery, are there to establish relationships and help guide the homeless toward help. Those personal struggles make their interactions with the homeless genuine and empathetic, Hardy said. \n \nNavigator Sarah Humble uses her story of recovery from opiate abuse and struggle with a mental disorder, to establish rapport with members of an often mistrustful population. \n \nHumble was involved in a recent meeting with a woman who was barred from the library after assaulting someone who had accidentally bumped into her, Knowles said. \n \nThe woman wanted permission to return to the library, and told Knowles she had taken steps toward recovering from a substance abuse problem. Humble \u201ctold her she was also in recovery and set the foundation for the relationship with the customer,\u201d Knowles said. \n \n\u201cThis gal was at the point where she knew she had an issue,\u201d Knowles said, \u201cand was so pleased there was somebody in recovery she could talk to.\u201d \n \nThe navigators are trained and employed by the Colorado Mental Wellness Network. \n \nThe resource staff is often called on to de-escalate tensions. When a radio Schaefer carries came to life with news that a security guard was confronting a man washing his hair in a bathroom, an activity that is not allowed, she responded. \n \n\u201cShe went in and was able to intervene and begin a relationship with him,\u201d Hardy said. \n \nEngaging the man in conversation Schaefer learned that he lost his home after suffering a serious brain injury. \n \nSchaefer referred the man to the Brain Injury Alliance of Colorado and got him into a housing program that gives preference to those considered most vulnerable. The Alliance is on a list of service providers that includes the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, Veterans Affairs Administration, Mental Health Center of Denver. \n \nThe man was given a housing voucher and is now looking for an apartment with the help of his Brain Injury Alliance case manager. \n \nWhen a suicide note was found sitting by a computer in one of the branch libraries, it was brought to the resource officers\u2019 attention. \n \n\u201cWe knew who it was,\u201d and were able to get that person help, Hardy said. \u201cThat has happened three or four times since I have been here.\u201d \n \nFor librarians, the presence of the resource team has reduced concerns that they were unable to help those those who came to them with questions they weren\u2019t able to answer, Henning said. \n \nAndy Cross, The Denver Post Folks, mostly homeless men and women, line up and wait to enter the Denver Central Library to warm up and to use their resources. Library visitors are required to follow rules that include no sleeping or leaving personal property unattended. \n \nIn April, the library placed a three-bag, or 30-inch height limit on bags brought into the facility, ensuring that shopping carts filled with possessions don\u2019t impede movement. \n \nThe restriction can lead to disputes. One morning recently a man who gave his name as Rabbit, arrived pulling a couple of small bags fastened to a luggage cart with a bungee cord. \n \nA security guard measured the bundle, and found it was slightly more than 30 inches tall. He was allowed to stay but told to reduce its height before he returns. \n \nRabbit thinks the rules are arbitrary, but said security guards \u201ctry to be fair.\u201d \n \nHardy and Schaefer train librarians and security guards on managing patrons who have experienced trauma, and give them information on how to shed the stress of dealing with those who have been traumatized. \u201cYou can work through your day and think you are not affected by that but you are,\u201d Hardy said. \n \nThe homeless also act as librarians\u2019 \u201ceyes and ears,\u201d letting them know when someone is in trouble, or causing a problem, Hardy said. \n \nHardy said she tries to impress on others how resilient the homeless are. By the time many of them arrive at the library, they have already struggled through difficulties that most never encounter. \n \nWhether they are sleeping on the street or in a shelter, they are likely to be awakened at 4:30 or 5 a.m. They have to pack up belongings, and carry them with them throughout the day, and they must find something to eat, and decide where they will spend the day. \n \n\u201cWhen we open at 10 every morning they have already had a full day,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cJust to recognize that is huge.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Tom McGhee"},"topics":[{"name":"Denver-Aurora news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Homeless spending days at Denver\u2019s libraries find help in the stacks","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Denver","zipCode":"80202","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Denver","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Denver Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661509","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"35315"},"name":"Denver Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.denverpost.com","publisher":"MediaNews Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198916777","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:44:36Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:47:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/denver-library-homeless-01262017-ac_ac36402x-001.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NY \u2014 Sahar, a recent Stony Brook University graduate whose Iranian parents flew into JFK to visit her this weekend, showed up to the airport Saturday morning with the hope of hugging and kissing her mom and dad after three years of separation. \n \nInstead, 32-year-old Sahar was informed by federal agents that her parents had been taken into custody \u2014 and would be forced to return to Iran on the next available flight. \n \n\"They won't allow me to see them,\" she said. \"I haven't seen them in years. I just want to see them, just for one minute. Just behind a window \u2014 anything.\" \n \nUPDATE, Sunday, 2:15 a.m.: Hours ago, a federal judge in Brooklyn temporarily halted Trump's Muslim immigration ban . However, as of this time, Sahar's parents are still detained. And she was just informed over the phone by a Customs and Border Protection officer that no decision will be made about their status until morning. \n  \nTrump signed an executive order Friday that bans people from certain countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days. The countries were not named in the order, but several news outlets reported them as Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. The order also indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees and bans the resettlement of refugees from any country for four months. \n\n \nVahideh Rasekhi , another Stony Brook University student currently working toward her PhD in linguistics, was also detained Saturday at JFK on her way back from spending winter break in Iran, according to the International Refugee Assistance Project. \n \nRasekhi and Sahar's parents were among approximately 20 immigrants and refugees detained at JFK by 6 p.m. Saturday , attorneys with the organization said. \n \nSahar \u2014 who did not want to provide her full name or show her face in a photo, for fear she would likewise be targeted by the Trump administration \u2014 broke down in tears in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall Saturday evening. \n \n\"If I'd known this would happen, I would have never come\" to the U.S., she said. \"I thought it was a democracy.\" \n \nIf Trump's new policy continues to prevent her from seeing her parents, Sahar said she and her husband will leave America. \n \n\"We'll have to go to a different country to find freedom,\" she said. \n \nSahar's parents secured two tourist visas back in October after \"an extensive security process,\" Urooj Khan, a volunteer attorney working on the family's case, told Patch. \n \nHowever, their visas were apparently voided as soon as Trump signed his order, while Sahar's parents were still in flight. \n \nSahar has not been allowed to speak with her mom and dad while they've been in Customs and Border Protection custody at JFK. She said she hopes they're not feeling afraid. \n \nAttorneys with the International Refugee Assistance Project filed a last-minute habeas petition on behalf of Sahar's parents in Brooklyn federal court Saturday \u2014 as they did for more than a dozen immigrants and refugees also detained at JFK, including Rasekhi \u2014 hoping court officials might intervene. By 6:30 p.m., though, there was still no answer. \n\n \nTurkish Airlines informed the attorneys that Sahar's parents would be placed on an 11 p.m. flight back to Iran. \n \nPhotos by Simone Wilson/Patch","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Simone Wilson"},"topics":[{"name":"New York metro area news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"College Student's Iranian Parents Detained At JFK: 'I Just Want To See Them,' She Sobs","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Kings","zipCode":"11215","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Brooklyn","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Carroll Gardens Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172080913","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Carroll Gardens Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.carrollgardens.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu/students/vahideh.rasekhi"],"sequenceId":"695198917001","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T23:42:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:47:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22859565/20170128/064224/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/unnamed-1485645607-4672.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Then, they ran out of bowls altogether. \n \nSoup lovers thronged to the park, at the edge of the Fifth Avenue South shopping district, giving the tree-shaded area in front of the bandstand the look of a rock concert \u2014 except everyone was sipping soup, comparing soups and considering which soup to try next. \n \nPeople lined up for blocks, hours before Empty Bowls opened at 11 a.m., to be among the first to choose their bowls and their soups. \n \nAfter first tastings, long lines formed in front of the kettles of the most popular soups, and volunteers kept busy dishing them up. \n \nJust after noon, Texas Tony\u2019s three-meat chili was the first to run out. \n \nJan Maria Jagush, a winter resident from Connecticut, was next in line when highly rated roasted artichoke soup from Talis Park was the next to go, but she took it in stride. \n \n\u201cThis is a great event,\" she said. \"I\u2019m all in favor of organizations that give it all back, that use all of the proceeds to help people.\u201d \n \nWith 100 percent of the soups donated and labor provided by volunteers, all the money raised goes to help the work of the Harry Chapin Food Bank, the largest hunger relief organization in Southwest Florida. The food bank feeds 28,000 people each week. \n \nEmpty Bowls co-chairwoman Betsy Dawson said the food bank uses its connections and purchasing power to leverage every dollar raised into $8 worth of food. Last year, the event raised $97,000, and Dawson said she was confident the goal of $100,000 this year would be surpassed. \n \nThere were 50 varieties of soup. \n \nAll of the French bread was donated and served by Panera Bread, which baked 400 baguettes, enough to make 4,600 chunks of bread, to help participants sop up every bit of soup. \n \nLocal artists, including Muffy Clark Gill, made one-of-a-kind ceramics that were sold in a silent auction, bringing in additional thousands of dollars. \n \n\u201cFriends of Empty Bowls\u201d wore miniature ceramic tasting bowls around their necks, and a volunteer crew that included many area high school students worked hard to keep everything running smoothly. \n \nVolunteer Ron Kezeske of the Naples Jaycees even showed up with a laser thermometer and stopped volunteers about to serve from one refilled kettle. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s 130 degrees, but it needs to be 135,\u201d he said. \n \nIn front of the stage, a dozen potters threw new bowls on the wheel, getting a start on next year\u2019s bowls. \n \nOne of the potters, Danny Ripka, has been making bowls for the event for nine years. Ripka said he still gets a thrill when someone comes by eating soup out of one of his creations. \n \nThe restaurants furnished their soups in disposable paper bowls, so each soup could be tasted on its own. \n  Buy Photo  \nDanny Ripka makes a bowl during the annual Empty Bowls Naples fundraiser in Naples, Fla., Saturday, Jan. 28, 2017.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Real estate news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 23 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cumberland","zipCode":"04101","state":"Maine","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portland","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WMTW","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659817","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"89"},"name":"WMTW","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","RealEstate"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wmtw.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198929313","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Zimbabweans among other foreigners in the Sadc country have been rattled by the planned protests, against a background of bloody xenophobic attacks in KwaZulu-Natal in 2015, memories which are still fresh. \n\nDeputy Minister of Home Affairs Obedingwa Mguni said the Government was confident that its citizens living in the neighbouring country were safe. Mguni said the Zimbabwean Government was given assurance by South African authorities that any action of a xenophobic nature would be dealt with decisively. \n\n\"Although we may not be in full control of what takes place in South Africa but through constant engagement with our South African counterparts we are well assured that they are on top of the situation. They (South African Government) have even issued a statement on this matter,\" he said. \n\nAdded Mguni, \"The Government of South Africa has guaranteed the safety of our nationals. There is no way they will allow another episode of xenophobic attacks. I'm quite assured\". \n\nMguni said the two governments of Zimbabwe and South Africa would continue engaging each other on ways of strengthening existing bilateral relations. South Africa's Department of Home Affairs last week issued a statement assuring the safety of foreign nationals living in the country. The department also denounced the planned protests and other xenophobic social media messages, encouraging citizens to ignore the messages. \n\n\"Citizens and all other persons in the country are strongly advised to ignore this false alarm that is seemingly seeking to fuel tensions in the country, at a time when priority is given to economic development, creating jobs and fighting poverty and inequality,\" reads the statement in part. \n\nRecent weeks saw the South African social media replete with reports that the Government had ordered immediate deportation of undocumented migrants from Monday 23 January 2017. The Home Affairs Department, in its statement also dismissed the reports as false and malicious. \n\n\"The Department of Home Affairs wishes to inform the public that such information is false. No such statement was made or issued by the department or any official. \n\n\"It would run contrary to the laws of our country to instruct citizens, as purported in the malicious messages, to take the law into their hands, and to close companies down without due process. \n\n\"The Minister of Home Affairs will soon explain in more detail the department's approach on this important matter of immigration and asylum-seeker management. He will shed more light on South Africa's implementation of systems for managing processes relating to asylum and undocumented migrants, among others,\" the statement further read. \n\nThe Home Affairs department has also called for co-operation of South African citizens and stakeholders to ensure a safe and secure country.

(Photo: Justin Lane, EPA) \n  \nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Hundreds of outraged demonstrators converged on San Francisco International Airport Saturday afternoon, in defiance of President Trump's executive order banning refugees and foreign citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries entry into the U.S. \n \nWaving signs reading \u201cMy Grandparents Were One of the Lucky Ones\" and \"One Earth, One People, One Love,\u201d they chanted in full throat, \"You put a wall, we tear it down\" and \"Never again!\" \n \nAs the crowd swelled to as many as 1,000, some protesters spilled onto the road that circled the international terminal, briefly blocking access for cars attempting to get to the terminal. Organizers extended the peaceful protest. \n \nGoogle co-founder Sergey Brin, an immigrant himself, and California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom were among the protesters. \n \nSan Francisco Mayor Ed Lee issued a statement, calling the ban \"disgusting.\" \n \n\"As the son of Chinese immigrants, I am disgusted by the President\u2019s Executive Order to target the Muslim community and ban immigrants from entering the United States,\" the mayor said. \n \nThe crowd only began to thin after a federal court in Brooklyn issued a temporary emergency stay halting Trump's order late Saturday. But it remained large, and boisterous, deep into the night. \n \n\"It was chaos,\" Buzz Frahn, an immigration attorney from Palo Alto, Calif., said of the demonstration. \n \nFrahn was one of dozens of lawyers who rushed to the airport to assist families waiting for members to clear customs. He said he was aware of at least five travelers detained who are Iranian. \n \n\u201cMy parents came from Iran right before I was born,\u201d protester Samin Nosrat, 37, of Berkeley told the San Francisco Chronicle . \u201cI am the child of refugees.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

You toss and turn, look at the clock and inevitably wake up feeling depleted. It makes it tough to stay awake during the day and focus on important tasks. Sleeplessness is a common problem in our busy society, and an ongoing lack of sleep can impact every part of a person\u2019s life. \n \nA good night\u2019s sleep helps the mind and body in many ways including avoiding excessive daytime fatigue, staying alert and focused, and strengthening the immune system, which also leads to better overall health, less sick days, and more productivity. \n \nA lack of good sleep can pack a host of consequences including negatively impacting decision making and memory retention abilities, decrease in reaction time, irritability, weight gain and general physical stress on the body which can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. \n \nLack of sleep can also be dangerous for others, not just the person dealing directly with the issue. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, sleepy drivers cause more than 100,000 crashes each ear. Of those, 40,000 result in injuries, with 1,550 deaths. It only further highlights the importance of a good night\u2019s sleep. \n \nIf you need help to remedy a lack of quality sleep, here are a few suggestions: \n \n» Get into a bedtime routine that occurs at the same time every day. Your body will automatically begin to \u201cget sleepy\u201d if you go to bed at the same time every night. \n \n» Exercise during the day. Get at least 20-30 minutes of vigorous exercise daily. But don\u2019t exercise too close to bedtime. It\u2019s best to exercise five to six hours before bedtime. \n \n» Try not to nap during the day. If you must take a nap, limit it to no more than 20 minutes. \n \n» Avoid stimulants like smoking or drinking coffee within five or six hours from when you want to go to bed.  Contrary to what you might think, alcohol can disrupt sleep as well. While it may cause you to fall asleep initially, it doesn\u2019t allow for the more restful phases of sleep, not to mention that you may also have to get up in the night to use the bathroom. \n \n» Create a meditative and relaxing environment in your bedroom that is quiet and dark, and use the time getting ready for bed to calm your mind. This means that it is best to not have a television in the room. Also pick another room to charge your cell phone at night such as the kitchen or living room. \n \nIf you\u2019ve tried most, if not all, of these already and you are still struggling with fatigue from poor sleep, medication is rarely the best option to get a better night\u2019s sleep. Even over-the-counter medications have risks, especially when used regularly. If you are using medication for sleep more than a couple times a month, or if you find the suggestions above are not helping, it is worth mentioning at your next doctor\u2019s appointment.

Those ideas would drastically change the way Medicare works for those already on it and those joining in the next few years. \n \nMedicare is wildly popular, but that popularity doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into understanding of a very complex program, what\u2019s happened to it, and what may happen. Writing about Medicare for nearly 30 years and watching it evolve, I\u2019ve seen how easily Congress has already made big changes with hardly a peep from the press or the public. The same could happen again. In this column I discuss a few of those possible changes gleaned from my decades of experience covering the program. \n \nSince the election, there\u2019s been talk of \u201cvoucherizing\u201d or privatizing Medicare, an idea Republicans have been pushing for 20 years. Under a fully privatized arrangement, Medicare would no longer be social insurance like Social Security. It would be more like Obamacare with everyone eventually buying their coverage from private insurance companies. \n \nBeneficiaries would receive a sum of money, likely to be called \u201cpremium support\u201d instead of the more dire-sounding \u201cvoucher,\u201d to help buy their coverage. The amount of support and how well it would keep pace with medical inflation would be buried in the details Congress would hash out. \n \nToday, the government provides the benefits for hospital and physician care for most Medicare beneficiaries, but that could change with more privatization. There already is a lot of privatization in Medicare, and it came about step-by-step \u2013 usually with both political parties in agreement and lots of buzz words like \u201cconsumer choice\u201d to sell changes to the public. \n \nThe long steady march toward Medicare Advantage (MA) plans now used by about one-third of all beneficiaries and the prescription drug benefit are privatized insurance programs within Medicare. Seniors in MA plans give up their traditional, standardized Medicare benefits for doctor and hospital services and buy them from insurers that receive subsidies from the government. \n \nIn a totally privatized arrangement, there may be no standardized benefits, and seniors would choose from a menu of insurance company options much the way drug plans are sold today. \n \nIt\u2019s too early to say whether Congress will push for premium support this year. Democrats have already signaled they will fight back. It\u2019s more likely that other changes could slip through that would radically alter Medicare and force beneficiaries to pay a lot more for their care. \n \nOne of them is a change in the rules on balance billing: physicians charging seniors and disabled people on the program more than what Medicare will pay. Most doctors accept Medicare\u2019s payment as payment in full. Those who don\u2019t can charge patients only 15 percent more than Medicare\u2019s payment. This limit offers protection against the high balance billing charges patients with other kinds of insurance are facing. \n \nThe nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price is no fan of the 15 percent rule and once proposed eliminating it, which may explain why he has gotten such a strong endorsement from the American Medical Association. The AMA has called Price a leader in developing public policy to advance patient choice and \u201creduce excessive regulatory burdens.\u201d Many doctors who work with Medicare patients would like to charge as much as they want. \n \nCongress may try to shift costs another way. The objective is to reduce what the government pays for beneficiaries\u2019 care by making them pay more themselves. One solution is to combine the deductibles for hospital and physician care into one, and impose an out-of-pocket spending cap for beneficiaries still enrolled in traditional Medicare. Two-thirds of beneficiaries are. Currently no such cap exists. (Seniors in MA plans do face such caps \u2013 last year as high as $6,700.) \n \nIf seniors in the traditional program also buy a Medigap plan, it\u2019s possible they have what\u2019s called \u201cfirst dollar coverage.\u201d That means medical expenses are covered from the beginning. \n \nCongress has already begun to take that protection away. Beginning in 2020 insurers can no longer sell certain Medigap plans that provide for the first dollar coverage beneficiaries want. However, if you have such a policy, you can keep it. \n \nMedicare does face some long-term funding shortfalls, and so far the acceptable solution is to require that seniors pay more rather than raise taxes for everyone or impose cost controls with teeth, which doctors, hospitals, drug companies, and other healthcare providers don\u2019t want. I will explore all that, including negotiating pharmaceutical prices, in a future column. \n \n \n\u2014 The Rural Health News Service is funded by a grant from The Commonwealth Fund and distributed through the Nebraska Press Association Foundation, the Colorado Press Association, the South Dakota Newspaper Association and the Hoosier (Indiana) State Press Association.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Trudy Lieberman"},"topics":[{"name":"Health insurance news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Medicaid and Medicare news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Thinking About Health: Major changes may be coming to Medicare","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Weld","zipCode":"80631","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Greeley","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Greeley Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669255","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1081"},"name":"Greeley Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.greeleytribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198948689","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.greeleytribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Trump_Congress_40457-f6c04-620x463.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Thanks to an overhauled water budget system , residents may soon have the power to pick their days \u2014 any days; all days \u2014 so long as they stay within their budget. \n \nThe Greeley water and sewer board approved lifting the restrictions, but the city council will have to give final approval \u2014 likely next month. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d said Harold Evans, chairman of the city\u2019s water and sewer board. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to say you have a budget, we shouldn\u2019t tell you what days you should water.\u201d \n \nWatering freedom would run from April 1 through Oct. 31, and city officials would take a look at the results before deciding whether to keep it going in 2018. The water budget, however, is here to say. \n \nThe water budget \u2014 and watering day freedom \u2014 would apply only to residential, single-family homes. Even then, the city will restrict watering between noon-5 p.m. Businesses and other commercial property will maintain the same water rate structure as they\u2019ve had in the past. \n \nSingle-family homes account for nearly half of the city\u2019s overall water usage, making that category ripe for change. \n \nEvans said the budget, which will take effect Wednesday, is more than a decade in the making, as city officials sought to stave off the effects of a drought like the one the state saw in early 2000s . \n \nComing to consensus took a lot of work, as did developing the budget for every household. \n \nGreeley staffers mapped every plot of land in Greeley to calculate the amount of irrigable area \u2014 basically any property you have outside of your roof, sidewalk and driveway. They used that area, combined it with an assumption that every inch of that area is planted with bluegrass, and came up with a formula that spits out enough water to take care of all of that. \n \n\u201cI think it\u2019s the core of what the water budget is all about,\u201d City Manager Roy Otto said, referencing the personalized water budget. \n \nInside, the city will budget 55 gallons per person per day, with the assumption that there are three people in every household. (Call the city if you have a larger family). \n \nCity officials say the budget should provide more than enough water for most residents. In testing the program with 16,700 households, the city found 83 percent of folks stayed within budget. \n \nIf you don\u2019t, well, you\u2019ll get charged more. This year\u2019s base rate is $3.97 per 1,000 gallons, which is actually cheaper than what folks paid last year. \n \nIf you use up to 130 percent more than your budget, you\u2019ll pay $4.85 per gallon for anything over your budget. The rates go up to $6.62 and then $8.82 per 1,000 gallons from there. Just 4 percent of the pilot group of 16,700 households went that far over their budget. \n \n\u201cWe think we\u2019ve developed a program that will reward efficiency, and yet it will also provide an incentive for people who are over-watering to cut back,\u201d Evans said. \n \nFor now, the changes won\u2019t apply to businesses or other commercial property. That\u2019s a little more tricky. \n \nA typical, tiered-rate structure would have been easier. That would involve one rate for a certain amount of water, and higher rates for anything above that. \n \nFort Collins has one, and such a structure can punish homeowners with a larger lot even if those homeowners practice water conservation. \n \n\u201cWithout that work done by the staff, we would have arbitrarily penalized people for being efficient with their water just for having a larger lot,\u201d Otto said. \n \nCity officials spent so much time studying the outdoor water use because they say it\u2019s the area with the most potential for savings. In some months \u2014 particularly April and October, when people run their sprinklers more than necessary \u2014 the city as a whole could cut water usage by half or more, according to city data. \n \nAs Greeley grows toward 250,000 people by 2060, getting folks in the habit of thinking about water conservation will be key, Evans said. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s a finite supply of water in Colorado,\u201d Evans said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be more efficient.\u201d \n \nTyler Silvy covers city and county government for The Greeley Tribune.

Losing a spouse, a friend, a job, their health or their freedom because they have to care for a family member all are factors. \n \nNorth Range Behavioral Health offers a free peer counseling service to help seniors like Hewitt with those feelings of isolation or loneliness. \n \nHewitt was a professor of sociology at the University of Northern Colorado for three decades and had a background in psychology. She was open to getting help, but she had no idea what kind of impact her peer counselor, Judy Rodriguez, would have. \n \n\u201cI tell her every time I see her she saved my life,\u201d Hewitt said. \n \nPeer counselors like Rodriguez focus on seniors. They have to be 55 years old or older and they\u2019re trained to work with older adults and families as they deal with the stress of aging. \n \nRodriguez comes to Hewitt\u2019s home once per week to talk and hang out. \n \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like a psychiatrist telling you how to get your life together,\u201d Hewitt said. \u201cShe\u2019s a peer. She\u2019s a friend.\u201d \n \nHewitt\u2019s counselor encouraged her to get involved at the senior center and reconnect with others. Reconnecting with friends and others was hard, but it was worth it. \n \nJerry Kearney, manager for the peer-counseling program at North Range, said the purpose of the program is to support seniors in the community whether they\u2019re living alone, with family or in assisted living or long-term care. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re very non-judgmental,\u201d Kearney said. \u201cWe pick them up where they\u2019re at, and we go from there.\u201d \n \nFor some reason, no one wants to admit they\u2019re old and hang out with the old people, Hewitt said. She remembered how her own mom didn\u2019t use her senior discount anywhere for many years. She also remembered how her mom would talk about not having any friends because they had died. She joked then, that her mom should make some younger friends so that they\u2019d last longer. She didn\u2019t understand how hard it was. \n \nShe gets it now. Her own friends are getting older and some have died. Friends aren\u2019t immediately replaceable, Hewitt said. \n \nHewitt\u2019s counselor has a similar sense of humor, and she\u2019d lost her husband shortly before meeting with Hewitt. \n \n\u201cJudy made me feel like I wasn\u2019t the only one,\u201d Hewitt said. \n \nBut Rodriguez also has training in psychology. She knows the vocabulary and can point out things like Hewitt\u2019s control issues, Hewitt said. It\u2019s helped her realize things about herself and work through her issues. \n \nThanks to Rodriguez\u2019s encouragement, Hewitt started writing again. She joined Writing your Life at the Senior Center. At the class, folks write about phases of their life and share parts with the class. For a long time, she\u2019d been focused on research writing for the university, but she\u2019d always loved humor writing. Hewitt decided to take a crack at making a humorous autobiography, and she had a blast. One section is called \u201cGoodbye Uterus,\u201d a funny account of a hysterectomy. \n \n\u201cTo be able to laugh at yourself is so healthy,\u201d Hewitt said. \u201cI lost that for awhile.\u201d \n \nHewitt\u2019s glad she asked for help, though she knows it\u2019s hard to do. \n \nNow, she\u2019s working with a CNA she hired on a cookbook. It\u2019s full of nutrient-packed recipes with easy-to-eat foods for people with multiple sclerosis. David can only use a spoon to eat now. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m not angry anymore,\u201d Hewitt said. \n \n \n\u2014 Kelly Ragan covers features and health for The Greeley Tribune.

Here comes the sun-soaked window to alter scorecards and muddy leaderboards. \n\nWhen players step onto the South Course at Torrey Pines for Sunday's final round of the Farmers Insurance Open, it could be a revenge-fueled rendition of Taming of the Shrewd. \n\nThe cagey course that so often wobbles knees with ocean crosswinds and greens that test a putt's shock absorbers showed a sliver of vulnerability Saturday. \n\nTwelve players sit within two strokes of the top with a round to go. The skies, now cloudless and deep San Diego blue, cranked down the gusts. The greens and rough continue to firm up by the minute. \n\nBuckle up. The final 18 holes could be a wild ride. \n\nCharles Howell III, who shot 69 to tie for 13th, said a day positioned to deliver the best weather of the week could spark fireworks. \n\n\"You may see it give up a low number,\" he said. \n\nCareful with assumptions: The South, so stubborn that it earned the 2008 U.S. Open, never loses all its teeth and isn't anywhere close to gumming its food. The course showed, however, that forgiving weather can make it mortal. \n\nConditions bolstered the anyone-could-win equity among a field that lost world No. 1 Jason Day, No. 3 Dustin Johnson and No. 14 Rickie Fowler before the weekend arrived. \n\nThe South's bullying ways melted in the sunshine, revealing a kinder, gentler side. On Thursday, nine players carded rounds of 3-under or better on the South. On Friday, just five. On Saturday, the club ballooned to 19. \n\n\"There's no better place to play golf than Torrey Pines in weather like this,\" said Phil Mickelson, who rode the meteorological about-face to record a 68, scrambled 30 spots and climbed into a tie at 18th. \"Looking out at the ocean, the views, it's just spectacular. The course is drying out very nicely and played great.\" \n\nThe evaporating stretch of wet, cold and windy that marked the start of the Farmers allowed an army of contenders to chase red numbers. \n\nTony Finau birdied four of his final six holes to finish with a 67. The 27-year-old tied tournament co-leader Patrick Rodgers and Pat Perez for low rounds of the day and grabbed a share of third. \n\n\"It was warmer, so the ball was traveling a little better - and not as much wind,\" he said. \"It's definitely a day where you feel like you can get after it.\" \n\nThe scoring average dipped from 74-and-change on Friday to 71.62 a day later. The tournament field has not broken 72 on a Sunday at the Farmers since the course renovation leading into 2002. \n\nThe combination of calm and a building, shared confidence could threaten that number Sunday. Tournament meteorologist Willis Young said another full day of drying could make the final round \"ideal.\" \n\n\"When there's no wind, it definitely makes this place a lot easier,\" said Marc Leishman, who hovers among a knot of players tied for fifth. \"Earlier in the week, it was hard to control spin. That's getting easier. \n\n\"And it's Sunday. Guys will attack, for sure.\" \n\nMention attack and the blood pumps. Add a congested leaderboard with so many players lingering within putter's reach of a $1.2 million bankroll, and the potential for hole-by-hole drama soars. \n\nImagine the scenarios alone on No. 18, the spot that surrendered one eagle through the first two rounds - but six while parked in front of Saturday's postcard-worthy backdrop. \n\nToss in a wild card or two like Justin Rose, the second-round leader who trudged to a 73 and now tangled in an eight-way tie for fifth, and the plotlines thicken substantially. \n\nThe finish could be something only a cardiologist dares to consider. \n\n\"Something good (Sunday) is going to go a long way,\" Rose said. \"If you shoot a low score, especially with some Sunday pressure, it will be a good situation. I get to free-wheel more than they do, so it could be a good thing.\" \n\nWhen Round 3 arrived, paragliders gracefully drifted along the coast. Fans peeled away jackets. Players settled into rhythms. The Farmers changed personality in mid-stride, opening the door to even more pitch-and-putt possibility. \n\nRodgers, the co-leader with two-time champ Brandt Snedeker, said Torrey Pines rarely looks as handsome as it did Saturday. \n\n\"This is what all the players come to San Diego for, is weather days like (this),\" he said. \"The golf course was perfect.\" \n\nAggressive doesn't translate to reckless, though. \n\nPatience will pay dividends until doorways present themselves. The thing, though: There's bound to be plenty of doors cracked open during the frenetic final lap. \n\n\"I'd still never say the South Course is easy,\" Howell III said. \"But if you're comparing it one day to the next, it's definitely more score-able.\" \n\nThat means one winner already is decided.

Carl Frampton has called on Leo Santa Cruz to complete the trilogy with a final showdown in Belfast after losing his WBA featherweight title in Las Vegas. Frampton was beaten for the first time in his career on a majority points decision at the MGM Grand as Santa Cruz regained the belt he lost to the Northern Irishman in July. Santa Cruz is open to the idea of a decider and Frampton wants the fight in his backyard.\n\n\"I hope so, I hope he is a man of his word and we can do it in Belfast,\" he said on Sky Sports 1. \"I have come to the States twice. We could do it four, five, six times. I hope we do it again. \"I am deeply disappointed but let's have a trilogy and have our names linked together forever and hopefully I can win 2-1.\"\n\nOne judge scored the contest at 114-114, but the other two gave it 115-113 in Santa Cruz's favour and the Mexican took a deserved victory. It was a smart performance by Santa Cruz, who improved immeasurably from the first bout in New York last summer, and his tactics shocked Frampton.\n\n\"I think it was the right decision, I thought it was close,\" the Northern Irishman added. \"He frustrated me at times, I didn't expect that game plan, the boxer got out-boxed by the brawler. I thought it was the right decision, I hope we can do it again, it was a close fight. \"I have got no excuses, I feel I want to say sorry, I feel like I have let everyone down. The best man won on the night. I am gutted. It was my fault.\"\n\nSanta Cruz admits he had to fight against his instinct as well as Frampton. \"I worked hard and did what I had t,\" he said. \"I fought a great fighter and let's make a third fight. He is a great fighter and a great counter-puncher. It was tough to change my style, in my head I wanted to go for it, but I was told to box him and that's what I did.\n\n\"I am a man of my word.

Among other things, the upgrades created a 30,000-square-foot atrium with views of the Detroit River and Canada,  increased parking and improved traffic flow, upgraded infrastructure, enclosed loading docks and redeveloped the former Cobo Arena as a 40,000-square-foot grand ballroom. \n \nAdditionally, the authority said a $2 million technology upgrade was completed in mid-December to allow 32,000 simultaneous users on Cobo\u2019s Wi-Fi network. \n \nIn 2016, the event center hosted 16 city-wide conventions, including the annual North American International Auto Show. \n \nCobo lays claim to being the 17th largest convention center in the country with 723,000 square feet of exhibition space and nearly 1.5 million visitors each year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sherri Welch"},"topics":[{"name":"Transportation industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Detroit news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Detroit Regional Transportation Authority makes early, $13.5 million debt payment that will save taxpayers","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Crains Detroit Business","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169715140","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"217"},"name":"Crains Detroit Business","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","InformationTechnology"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.crainsdetroit.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198969429","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4343","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Gatton","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Gatton Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664661","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"Gatton Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gattonstar.com.au","publisher":"APN Holdings NZ Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198980017","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Jensen defeated the next closest runner by nearly 23 full seconds in the race, leading start-to-finish. \n\nIn other distance events junior Elsa Racasan finished first in the 28-runner mile with a time of 4:56.61 (track adjustment of 4:53.61) and also currently holds the top C-USA mark. The Owls third winner of the afternoon was sophomore transfer Hannah Jackson , who won the 400m dash for a second straight indoor meet with a time of 57.08 (10th in C-USA). Jackson barely edged out sophomore teammate Bryanna Rideaux, who finished second in a time of 57.45. \n\nThe Owls also performed well in the jumps with senior All-American Daisy Ding making her 2017 debut and finishing fourth in the high jump (1.65m/5-05.00) and third in the triple jump (12.33m/40-05.50). Senior Cybil Obiozor , who won the C-USA Co-Female Athlete of the Week award after the opener, improved upon her season-debut in the triple jump with a second place finish of 12.55m (41-02.25). \n\nAfter a strong performance on Friday, Ijeoma Ugwunze followed it up with a third place finish in the shot put (14.20m/46-07.25). \n\n\u201cWe improved from two weeks ago, which is what we needed,\u201d Rice women\u2019s track & field head coach Jim Bevan said. \u201cWe had some great highlights today with Elsa dominating the mile, Ijeoma having a good day in the shot put and Hannah Jackson and Bryanah Rideaux going one-two in the 400m. Daisy started competing and scored high in the high/triple jump and Cybil improved her triple jump over two weeks ago and finished second. The biggest highlight was Katie Jensen dominating the 3000m, running a lifetime best and led from gun to wire. It was an extremely impressive performance. Now we can get into weekly rhythm of meets. \n\nOn Friday the Owls received personal best performances from Dreu Dixson , Dheryl Batts and Ugwunze in the weight throw while Marielle Brisbois won the pole vault and Kylie Swiekatowski placed fourth in the event. \n\nThe Owls will be back in action Feb. 3-4 when they compete at the Charlie Thomas Invitational in College Station, Texas. \n \n\n-RiceOwls.com-","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"W.

VERNON \u2013 Mattoon built a big early cushion and topped the Lady Rams basketball team 61-43 Saturday afternoon. \n \nMattoon ripped off an 11-2 run to start the game. The Green Wave built a 20-plus point margin going into halftime. The Lady Rams slashed the deficit to 11 with its outside shooting in the second half. \n \nMattoon entered the game unbeaten this season and ranked No. 4 in class 3A. \n \n\u201cThey're super. We knew that coming in, and they did the things to us we expected,\u201d Mt. Vernon coach Jeff Lonnon said. \n \nAvery Jackson led Mattoon with 22 points. Jackson surpassed the 1,500 career point mark in the game. Isabella Coffey added 12, and Sierra Thompson finished with 11 points and 12 rebounds. \n \n\u201cThey're a load,\u201d Lonnon said. \u201cThey've got the whole package. They've got an inside game when they want it, and they've got an outside game when they want it. They have a transition game when they want it.

Vernon found more success from long range in the third quarter. Heinzman canned three straight 3-pointers during the quarter. Bria Meyer also connected on a long-range bucket in the third period. \n \n\u201cLauren took that first half personal. I can tell you that,\u201d Lonnon said. \u201cLauren doesn't like it whenever people come on your floor or anywhere, whether it's home or away, and basically blows you out. And I think it made her mad.\u201d \n \nThe outside shooting allowed Mt. Vernon to slash into the Mattoon lead. Kendal Ryan's driving basket in the final minute of the third cut the deficit to 45-34. Mattoon countered with a 3-pointer from Ivy Nichols in the closing seconds. The bucket made the score 48-34 going into the fourth frame. \n \n\u201cWhen you've got a kid who really is probably your fifth offensive option that you can throw it to and knock a three down at the end of a quarter, then you know you have something special going,\u201d Lonnon said. \n \nMt. Vernon dropped to 8-14 overall this season while Mattoon improved to 24-0. \n \nThe Lady Rams travel to Centralia on Tuesday night.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"PAUL HINES paul.hines@register-news.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Mattoon downs Lady Rams","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"62864","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Mount Vernon","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Register News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169712630","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Register News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.register-news.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198987185","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:03:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-news.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/fc/8fc3a67c-e5b6-11e6-937f-0b41b512c1e3/588d31e9819bb.image.jpg?resize=300%2C380"}],"video":[]}}

It won an Oscar for Best Picture. Anyway, the movie was about the brilliant work the Boston Globe did to uncover the damage wrought by Catholic Church leaders who covered up sexual abuse among the priesthood. As a result, many more kids were abused. \n \nMandatory reporting laws exist precisely so something like that doesn\u2019t happen again. That\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t matter that Melendez and Antuna are former police officers. When they chose to investigate the complaint themselves, they showed they learned nothing from \u201cSpotlight\u201d or any other incident like it. We don\u2019t know what happened between the teacher and the girl. But we aren\u2019t soothed by the fact that Melendez and Antuna fired the teacher. In our mind, this makes the oversight worse. This means they released a man they deemed unfit to work at their school out into the world to save the school some perceived embarrassment. \n \nIn fact, some evidence shows the teacher displaying a disturbing pattern of inappropriate behavior and possibly abuse. He was apparently coached on \u201chow to conduct himself appropriately and professionally in order to make sure there weren\u2019t any allegations,\u201d a board member, Virginia Rosales, said an in email. \n \n\u201cWe certainly would have reported it if there was something sufficient enough to do that,\u201d Rosales said in the email. \n \nThe thing is, that\u2019s not Salida\u2019s decision to make, and that\u2019s not the decision of Melendez and Antuna. That\u2019s for law enforcement to decide. That is, in fact, what law enforcement will decide now. Only now, in our mind, it\u2019s mostly too late. A man who potentially did something inappropriate to an eighth-grader, and who may have shown a pattern of abuse to children, is out there now, and it\u2019s entirely possible he could be teaching again, or working with children in some way. Our children are now not as safe as they could be as a result. \n \nWe say it\u2019s mostly too late. There\u2019s still one outcome we hope happens soon. It would be inappropriate for us to root for criminal charges, but we at least look forward to the police department completing a fair, accurate and scouring investigation of the school board, Melendez and Antuna. Most of all, we want it to be as public as possible. That\u2019s exactly the kind of embarrassment they wanted the school to avoid. The only difference now is that they\u2019re the ones who caused it. \n \n \n\u2014 The Tribune Editorial Board","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Media latest","group":"Media"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Tribune Opinion: Salida del Sol Academy put our children in danger by investigating sex-related compliant without calling police","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Weld","zipCode":"80631","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Greeley","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Greeley Tribune","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169669255","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1081"},"name":"Greeley Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.greeleytribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198992558","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:05:03Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.greeleytribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SalidadelSolReportCard-slideshow-GDT-080615-4-620x432.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Marcus Evans also had 23 points while grabbing a season-high six rebounds. Connor Cashaw had a season-high 17 points and pulled down seven rebounds and Marquez Letcher-Ellis added eight points and seven boards. \n \n\"That was a good rebound from Thursday,\" said Rice head coach Mike Rhoades . \"We did a good job of playing together and following the game plan. We were aggressive and played loose today. A lot of guys contributed. When we have multiple guys who are a threat, we're hard to guard.\" \n \nCashaw scored the first five points of the game. Charlotte then went on an 8-0 run to take an 8-5 lead. However, Egor Koulechov's three tied the game and sent Rice on a 14-0 run as Rice grabbed a 19-8 lead just 5:23 into the game. \n \nThe 49ers then scored nine of the next 11 points on a trio of three-pointers. Marcus Jackson made a layup, but Anthony Vanhook scored four straight points to pull Charlotte within 23-20. But, Cashaw responded with six straight points to give Rice a 29-20 lead with 7:38 to play in the first half. \n \nAfter trading baskets, Braxton Ogbueze hit a three and Quentin Jackson made one-of-two free throws, Koulechov then made a layup but baskets by Jon Davis and Austin Ajukwa cut the deficit 33-30 with 4:33 to play. However, Rice held the 49ers to just one-of-seven the rest of the half as it entered halftime with a 38-33 lead. \n \nRice opened the second half scoring seven of the first nine points to take a 45-35 lead. After four straight Charlotte points, Jackson converted a three-point play. Ogbueze made a layup, but Koulechov answered with a jumper. \n \nCharlotte then hit back-to-back baskets to cut the lead to five, but Evans answered with four straight points. The teams traded baskets before Vanhook converted a three-point play to cut the lead to 56-50 with 12:42 remaining. However, Rice went on a 17-6 run over the next 7:44 to put the game away. \n \nRhoades added, \"I'm really proud of our defense. (Charlotte) is a hard team to guard. They really attack you. I thought we did a good job of guarding the ball and helping each other. We finally did a good job of defending around the rim which really helped us.\" \n \nRice shot 55.4% (31-of-56) from the floor, including 44.4% (8-of-18) from three and 77.8% (14-of-18) from the free throw line. Charlotte was held to 26-of-69 (37.7%) from the field and 5-of-20 (25.0%) from three. Rice also outrebounded the 49ers, 43-to-30. \n \nRice opens a three-game road trip next Saturday, Feb. 4, when it travels to Denton to face North Texas. Tip-off is scheduled for 2 p.m. CT and will be live-streamed by CUSA.tv.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"M.

CSU is now 16-5 overall. SDSU, meanwhile, falls to 3-5 versus MW foes and is 8-11 this season. \n \n\u201cColorado State is a very good team,\u201d head coach Stacie Terry said. \u201cThey were able to close out and contest. We got good shots but we didn\u2019t hit them and that caused us some problems. But I thought we competed tonight and I thought we played hard. The kids tried to follow through with the game plan as best they could and I\u2019m proud of them for that. They believed we could come in here and that they had a shot to win, so they came out and played.\u201d \n \nKhalia Lark matched a career high with 12 boards and recorded eight points, dishing out a pair of helpers. Kymberly Ellison posted 13 points, knocking down three of the Aztecs\u2019 seven long balls on the night, and adding six rebounds. McKynzie Fort was held to single-digit points for just the fourth time this season with nine, but served up a trio of assists and seven boards. Ariell Bostick also had three assists. \n \nThe first quarter was a thrilling, fast-paced affair that saw San Diego State hold the league\u2019s leader to 16 points while scoring 15 of its own.  The Aztecs were 6-of-14 from the floor, getting a pair of threes from Bostick and Ellison. \n \nIn the second quarter, SDSU tightened up its defensive play, holding the Rams to just eight field goal attempts, as compared to its own 16 shot attempts. San Diego State was out-scored in the frame, 12-8, trailing, 28-23, at the intermission. \n \nThe Aztecs\u2019 first-half play was largely due to their play on the glass. SDSU had 11 offensive rebounds in the opening 20 minutes, while the Rams managed just two offensive rebounds. \n \nSan Diego State kept up its staunch defensive play in the third quarter. The Scarlet and Black held the Rams scoreless for four-and-a-half minutes, while Ellison single-handedly out-scored Colorado State, 7-6, in the first 7:48 of the period. The Rams capped off the quarter with four straight points for a 38-30 advantage after 30 minutes. \n \nBut the Aztecs were unable to contain Colorado State, getting out-scored in the fourth, 22-13, for the final 60-43 score. \n \nSDSU won the battle at the glass, 40-27. But CSU held advantages in assists (16-9), blocks (3-0) and steals (8-1), turning the ball over 10 times as compared to San Diego State\u2019s 16 turnovers. Colorado State, which ranked second in the nation with a 32.5 field goal percentage defense heading into the game, was led by reigning MW Player of the Year senior Elin Gustavsson, who scored more than half of her team\u2019s points with a career-high 32 points. \n \nThe Scarlet and Black will stay on the road, heading to Wyoming on Wednesday, Feb. 1 for a 6:30 p.m. (MT) contest. \n \nPlay by play \n \nBox","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"San Diego news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"SDSU WOMEN'S HOOPS STYMIED BY LEAGUE-LEADING COLORADO STATE","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"San Diego","zipCode":"91941","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"La Mesa","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"East County Magazine","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169760177","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"East County Magazine","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.eastcountymagazine.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695198997765","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:32Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

According to the research paper, published in journal Biofabrication, the last layer consists of fibroblasts that produce collagen, the protein that gives elasticity and mechanical strength to the skin.\n\nBioinks are key to 3D bioprinting. Juan Francisco del Canizo, a Universidad Complutense de Madrid researcher, said: \"Knowing how to mix the biological components, in what conditions to work with them so that the cells don't deteriorate and how to correctly deposit the product is critical to the system.\"\n\nThe process for producing these tissues can be carried out in two ways: To produce allogeneic skin from a stock of cells, done on a large scale, for industrial processes; and to create autologous skin, which is made case by case from the patient's own cells, for therapeutic use, such as in the treatment of severe burns.\n\n\"We use only human cells and components to produce skin that is bioactive and can generate its own human collagen, thereby avoiding the use of the animal collagen that is found in other methods,\" the researchers noted.\n\nThis method of bioprinting allows skin to be generated in a standardised, automated way and the process is less expensive than manual production.\n\n--IANS\n\nsku/sm/vt \n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Now print human skin with this 3D bioprinter","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNP6"],"sequenceId":"695198998197","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}
