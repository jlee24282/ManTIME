Many of them start the process in January, a month when the divorce rate rises by roughly one-third. \n \nYet the resources available fall surprisingly short in offering the support and sense of understanding that these women need, said Jill Sockwell, a 1994 graduate of Marion Center High School who grew up in Home and now lives in Maplewood, N.J., near New York City. \n \nCommunity, she said, is the one thing that can turn the shattering experience of divorce into a tolerable and ultimately a positive one. \n \nShe writes about the community who helped her and co-author Suzanne Riss in a new book, \u201cThe Optimist\u2019s Guide to Divorce: How to Get Through Your Breakup and Create a New Life You Love\u201d ($14.95). \n \nWhen Sockwell separated from her husband in 2010, she planned to read her way through the pain and learn from the experiences of divorced women who preceded her. \n \nWhat she found were clinical tomes written by counselors and lawyers, and memoirs written by wealthy women who went on worldwide quests of self-discovery. She did not find uplifting advice from women who survived their divorces and shared their lessons in how to forge a realistic path to a new and better place. \n \nThat\u2019s because this book didn\u2019t exist. \n \nWhen Riss started this same process a year later, a mutual friend introduced her to Sockwell, allowing the two of them to become this necessary resource for each other. Realizing that other women could use the kind of support they were giving each other, Sockwell and Riss created the Maplewood Divorce Club, offering conversation, a sense of community, guest speakers and advice to women seeking divorce. \n \nThe group was successful beyond their wildest dreams and has been growing ever since. \n \nTheir book offers advice from its members, women who know what it feels like to go through divorce, who understand the practical issues as well as the emotional ones, and who can help the reader keep a sense of hope and a sense of humor. \n \nIt also offers a powerful, uplifting message, Sockwell said: The end of a significant relationship is the best time to introduce positive change in your life. \n \nPacked with practical advice, smart strategies, and memorable personal stories from a diverse circle of 12 women, the book is broken into three sections. \n \nThe first, Deal, focuses on what readers need to know right away: how to tell the kids, confront finances, figure out where to live, find legal help, and emotionally get through the day. The second section, Heal, helps readers work through their anger, loss and sadness and develop an action plan for the future; and the third, Reveal, celebrates the hard work and a new, stronger self with advice on creating your own community, dating and exploring new relationships. \n \nIn addition to writing the book, Sockwell is a senior sales associate with Keller Williams Mid-Town Direct Realty. \n \nShe has two daughters: Brooke, 11, and Natalie, 1","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: book news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Home native pens book on divorce","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Indiana","zipCode":"15701","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indiana","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Indiana Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172621035","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"16"},"name":"Indiana Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianagazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196487232","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:49:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Australian Test opener Matt Renshaw is seeking the counsel of former great Matthew Hayden for tips on how to conquer spin in India as he embarks on his first Test tour. , Renshaw is not allowing himself to be daunted by the prospect of playing on the dust bowls of the subcontinent against the world's No.1 Test nation.\n\nSince recovering from concussion, the youngster has been gearing his game for the examination by spin he will face against Virat Kohli's rampaging team. His preparation has included batting on an \"extreme\" turner at Cricket Australia's National Cricket Centre in Brisbane which was designed to exaggerate the conditions he will confront in India.\n\nRenshaw is due to fly to Dubai on Monday for Australia's pre-tour camp but not before consulting fellow Queenslander Hayden, Hayden famously mastered the sweep shot after weeks of intense practice with his brother on a specially made dusty pitch in Brisbane. His haul of 549 runs at 109.8 in three matches is the second most by an Australian in India, behind only Kim Hughes, who hit 594 runs from a six-Test series in 1979/80.\n\nWhile Australia failed to end their drought in 2001, Hayden's success on that campaign instilled great confidence in his teammates for the successful 2004 mission.\n\n\"I got his number off Andy Bichel, so I might give him a call to get a few quick pointers before I head off,\" Renshaw said. \"I'm not as experienced in the sweep shot as him. [\"I'll have] a fair bit more practice over the next couple of months.\n\nDespite honing his craft on the bouncy Gabba wicket, Renshaw says he is confident against spin, although there are no players in Australia in the class of Indian duo Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.\n\n\"I'm not too bad against spin in Australia but I've never experienced spin in India, so it's hard to say [how I will go],\" Renshaw said.\n\nUnder the watch of Queensland coach Phil Jaques, Renshaw has been preparing on a pitch that is offering more spin and bounce than what he will get in India and, in his own words, \"didn't go too badly\".\n\n\"If it's harder there, it can go into a game and it gets a bit easier,\" Renshaw said. \"There's a wicket at the NCC in the indoor nets that turns a lot more, it's a bit less realistic than the Mumbai wickets at AB [Allan Border] Field. It's not the worst thing to practice on.\"\n\nRenshaw's lack of experience on the subcontinent can be seen as a negative, though the glass half full view is it means he does not bear the scars of previous failures.\n\n\"I think it helps that I've not been there. It's a challenge. I like to get up for challenges and to love the contest,\" he said.\n\nRenshaw said he would not be concerned if asked to field in close again despite suffering concussion after being hit on the helmet at short leg during the Sydney Test.\n\nThe injury resulted in him becoming the first player to be withdrawn from a Test under Cricket Australia's stringent concussion rules.\n\n\"If I have to do it in India I wouldn't be too mentally scarred from it. I'd be trying to get a couple of catches in there and win a series,\" Renshaw said. \"They [the doctors] just said I need to stop headbutting the ball.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrew Wu"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"India v Australia Test series: Matt Renshaw to consult Matthew Hayden for tips to play spin in India","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2444","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Port Macquarie","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Port Macquarie News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"351643997","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"19"},"name":"Port Macquarie News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.portnews.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196487394","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:40:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Keynote Speaker M. Mike McNair, left, Community Service Award Winner Cindy A. Michael, center, Lena Mason Christian Memorial Fund, and Honorary Chairman Robert Morales, President UAW Local 1714...by R. Michael Semple \n \nWARREN \u2014 Media and social networking are two things that President Donald Trump has brought to the forefront recently, and they were the theme Saturday at the A. Philip Randolph Institute\u2019s annual Salute to MLK dinner. \n  \nThe dinner was held at DiVieste\u2019s banquet hall and is part of an annual tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. \n \nTimothy Callion, president of the Trumbull County chapter of the A. Philip Randolph Institute for the past six years, said that up to 400 invitations to the dinner are sent out. \n \n\u201cThis is our 30th anniversary,\u201d Callion said. \n \nThe theme of the dinner was \u201cThe Effectiveness of the Media in the Social Network World,\u201d and the keynote speaker was M. Mike McNair, publisher of The Buckeye Review newspaper. Two awards were presented: Honorary Chairperson and the Community Service Award. \n \nRobert Morales of Boardman was the honorary chairperson, a title he received because of his work as president of the United Auto Workers Local 1714, based at the General Motors assembly plant in Lordstown, which has had members contribute to APRI events in the past. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m here physically receiving the award, but really it goes to all the people at the UAW,\u201d Morales said. \u201cTruly the hard work, effort, and honor goes to them.\u201d \n \nThe Community Service Award was presented to Cindy Michael of Warren, staff representative for the AFSCME Ohio Council. Michael said she found out she was receiving the award only a couple of weeks ago, and that it was because of the work being done in the community by the Lena Mason Christian Memorial Fund. The fund was established in the aftermath of the murders of Michael\u2019s daughter, Lena, and two grandchildren, Mason and Christian, and now sets out to help children and families in need. \n \n\u201cWe wanted them to be remembered in a positive light,\u201d Michael said, adding that the fund had its first fundraiser in 2006 and that members include family members, volunteers and members of the AFL-CIO Union Council. The fund\u2019s biggest event is the free Kids Fun Day and Bookbag Giveaway, where families with children are treated to a day of entertainment and food and are sent home with a bookbag full of school supplies. \n \n\u201cWe always tell families that we\u2019re just a phone call away,\u201d Michael said. \n \nAside from the awards, the APRI annually presents $2,000 to $3,000 worth of scholarships to two or three students from school districts within Trumbull County. According to Callion, the MLK dinner is one of many events that the APRI holds to help fund the scholarships, although planning on which students will receive them will not begin until the spring. \n \nddye@tribtoday.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Cleveland news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Black interest news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Awards given at annual MLK Jr. salute dinner","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Trumbull","zipCode":"44483","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Warren","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tribune Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169710805","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"299"},"name":"Tribune Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tribune-chronicle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196487766","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The services range from ambulance rides to attending fireworks displays and fire alarm and sprinkler inspections, fire department officials said. \n \nThe proposal in Warren stems from an effort by the International Association of Firefighters Local 204 against city hall\u2019s effort to reduce the number of captains in the Warren Fire Department from six to three and to abolish the requirement that fire inspectors be captains, in an attempt to control costs. \n \n\u201cWhen there are events \u2014 Relay For Life, the Italian, Greek and African-American festivals, and other programs \u2014 vendors pay fees to the city,\u201d said Warren firefighter John Jerina, president of Local 204. \u201cWhen the department sends inspectors to check each of their vendor booths, they should be charged for these services. Inspection costs should be part of their fees.\u201d \n \nInspections is just one way Warren firefighters propose to raise funds. Others include charging insurance companies and others for the city\u2019s use of its equipment when the department responds to an accident or other emergency and increasing fees for having firefighters present at fireworks displays and other non-emergency events. \n \nNiles Fire Department charges a flat $200 fee for standing by at fireworks displays and other fees for sprinkler, fire alarm and hood suppression systems. The city generated $1,000 last year and is expected to only double that in 2017, said fire Chief Dave Danielson. \n \n\u201cIt is not a lot of money,\u201d Danielson said. \u201cWe\u2019re attempting to offset some of our costs.\u201d \n \nWarren and Bristol townships charge for ambulance service. Warren does not provide ambulance service. \n \n\u201cWe do not charge for any other services,\u201d Warren Township Fire Chief Ken Schick said. \u201cThe billings are helpful in financing the EMS services. The money earned is not used in other areas of the department.\u201d \n \nSaid Bristol fire Chief Tom Dempsey, \u201cwe will charge insurance companies for the equipment used during auto accidents, especially if we have to use extraction tools. We will charge for scene protection and hazmat equipment and material.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe do not charge individuals,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are doing is trying to recoup our costs.\u201d \n \nHowland has a permit fee schedule of charges for services, but the township does not bill for fire-related services like the need for a rescue truck at a vehicle accident, said fire Chief James Pantalone. \n \nThe fee schedule includes the costs of different types of inspections and permits, including occupancy for new businesses in the township. \n \n\u201cWhat we charge depends on the services,\u201d Pantalone said. \u201cWe are a delegated fire service, meaning the township has the ability to draft and manage our own permit fee schedule.\u201d \n \nOther communities rely solely on tax dollars to run their departments. \n \n\u201cThe mayor, safety service director and I, all feel people pay taxes to receive the services we provide,\u201d said Girard fire Chief Ken Bornemiss. \u201cWe don\u2019t charge for anything outside of the tax money our residents pay.\u201d \n \nrsmith@tribtoday.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Cleveland news","group":"US regional"}],"title":"Communities charge for non-fire services","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Trumbull","zipCode":"44483","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Warren","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tribune Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169710805","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"299"},"name":"Tribune Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tribune-chronicle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196487975","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It was possible that he started to walk part way home and becoming ill, he was overcome by the cold. \n \n50 years ago in 1967: \n \n\u2022 Flags were flying half staff over Trumbull County and Warren city buildings in memory of astronauts Gus Grissom, Edward White and Roger Chaffee, who died in a Jan. 27 fire aboard the Apollo I capsule at Cape Kennedy. \n \n\u2022 Newton Falls police Department released its yearly report. \n \nPolice Chief Earl McGregor released the activity report for his department for 1966, showing 53 arrests for civil offenses and 141 for traffic violations for a total of 194. \n \nThe largest number of civil arrests was for intoxication, 19; disturbance, 6; and assault and battery, 6. \n \nThe report states 771 complaints were investigated, 76 accidents investigated, 39 persons injured, and 30 cases of property damage were reported. \n \nThere were also 75 warnings issued, two persons reported missing and twopersons returned. \n \n25 years ago in 1992: \n \n\u2022 A township road was reported to have growing pains as state Route 46, also known as Niles-Cortland Road, was being widened. \n \nCommercial development along Ohio 46 requires many changes as it stretches through this township toward its namesake cities to the south and north. \n \nAnd when the winter weather breaks and road widening and waterline installation work begins, the state highway started to look like it was bursting at the seems. \n \nFederal money was used to widen the pavement to four \u2014 and in places, five \u2014 lanes between U.S. 422 and North River Road, according to William Clark of the Ohio Department of Transportation. \n \nThe county also planned to tie into a Niles waterline near Mines Road and Ohio 46 in order to supply customers in Howland. Charles Miller, Trumbull County sanitary engineer, said dialogue was under way between county and highway officials to synchronize the two projects. \n \nNear the Mines water tie-in was a 17-acre chunk of land on the west side of the road that was earmarked for the plaza. The land was idle following the sale of 17 to 18 homes on the site. \n \n10 years ago in 2007: \n \n\u2022 A new home for Harley lovers in Austintown rated a new name and designation. \n \nThe area where the Harley-Davidson store was to be built was designated \u201cBike Town\u201d by the township trustees. \n \nThe six-acre complex, located next to Quaker Steak and Lube near the intersection of Interstate 80 and state Route 46, will be the new home of Harley-Davidson / Buell of Youngstown. \n \nThe business is expected to open a 42,000-square-foot facility in July of 2007. \n \nTom Wronkovich, president / CEO of Harley-Davidson / Buell of Youngstown, asked trustees for a resolution that would give the complex the official designation of Bike Town. \n \n\u201cWe understand this is strictly an honorary designation,\u201d Wronkovich said. \u201cOur intention was simply to ask the township\u2019s help in promoting our facility.\u201d \n \nThe store was expected to be half as large as the Canfield Township location and was expected to employ 80 people and offer training to enable new riders to obtain their motorcycles. \n \n\u201cWe expect to attract motorcycle enthusiasts from a large area, and that will benefit the township as a whole,\u201d Wronkovich said. \n \nCompiled from Tribune Chronicle archives by Emily Earnhart","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Automotive industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Cleveland news","group":"US regional"}],"title":"Harley-Davidson fans get \u2018Bike Town\u2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Trumbull","zipCode":"44483","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Warren","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tribune Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169710805","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"299"},"name":"Tribune Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tribune-chronicle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196488175","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

UPDATED: January 28, 2017 at 9:56 p.m. Hours after President Donald Trump closed off America\u2019s borders to Syrian refugees and suspended immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries, over 150 Harvard affiliates assembled in the Square Friday evening in an \u201cemergency protest\u201d of Trump\u2019s policies. \nGathered at the corner of JFK St. and Massachusetts Ave., students and faculty brandished homemade posters and chanted slogans in protest of an executive order Trump signed Friday halting the entry of all refugees into the United States for 120 days. The order suspends immigration from seven Middle Eastern countries for 90 days, and bars Syrians\u2014including refugees\u2014from entering the United States indefinitely. \n \nThe protest also came two days after Trump ordered a wall be built on the border between the United States and Mexico. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been pretty crippled by the horrible news that\u2019s been coming out, but more so by the uncertainty of what\u2019s to come,\u201d Hazami Barmada, an organizer and student at the Kennedy School, said to protesters. \u201cBut this [protest] is not anything political.\u201d \n \n\u201cThis is not about us being anti-anything,\u201d Barmada added. \u201cThis is about us being for something\u2014for justice, for peace, for humanity.\u201d \n \nThe Global Justice Working Group, a student activist group at the Kennedy School, led the \u201cimpromptu\u201d rally, according to Rana Abdelhamid, another organizer and Kennedy School student. Protesters chanted \u201cThe people, united, will never be divided\u201d in both English and Spanish between speeches from organizers and activists. In addition to students from the Kennedy School, students from the College, Law School, and School of Public Health also joined the rally. \n \nThe protest follows similar ones at the College and nationwide in support of immigrants, women, and other minorities whom Trump has at times targeted with statements and policy proposals. \n \n\u201cWelcome to the resistance!\u201d Timothy P. McCarthy, a History and Literature lecturer who also teaches at the Kennedy School, said to kick off the protest. \n \n\u201cThis is the time for resistance. It is a time for opposition. But it is also a time for us to all come together across different races and across from all the different places where we work\u2014to come together to take the country back from the forces that are trying to steal it from us and deny us our fundamental human rights,\u201d McCarthy said. \n \nSome attendees said they were there to demonstrate unity and stand behind those who will likely be affected by Trump\u2019s executive orders. \n \nJesus Reyes Ruiz, a student at the Kennedy School and a member of the school\u2019s Mexican Caucus, said that he attended the rally to represent \u201cthe Mexican community here\u201d but also stand in solidarity with \u201cour Middle Eastern brothers and sisters.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe most important thing that we\u2019re here to show support for is standing against the executive actions that have been issued by the President,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe them to be profoundly un-American.\u201d \n \nPaul A. Ochoa, a student at the Kennedy School and native of Tijuana, Mexico, said he wanted to support his hometown and rally against the proposed border wall. \n \n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know Tijuana, it\u2019s the border city of San Diego and Mexico,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cWe consider both cities...one big community and the idea that there be another wall\u2014because there\u2019s already a large fence there\u2014doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d \n \nAri Berman \u201919 said she attended the rally out of concern for the impact Trump\u2019s immigration restrictions will have on refugees. Most refugees, she said, \u201care escaping prosecution and radicalization and just trying to rebuild their lives, which have been torn to the ground.\u201d \n \nClosing out the rally, organizers called on attendees to stand with Muslims, women, and minorities who might be anxious about their future under the Trump administration. \n \n\u201cThe power of the people is stronger than the people in power,\u201d Abdelhamid said. \u201cWe did this in four hours. Imagine what we can do, and imagine what we\u2019re going to continue to do, to fight against bigotry and to fight against discrimination in the next four years.\u201d \n \nHarvard students have also started organizing to attend similar protests of Trump\u2019s policies in the Boston area on Sunday. \n \n\u2014Staff writer Derek G.

Reuters \n \nThe U.S. technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, hit back on Saturday at President Donald Trump's sudden executive order on immigration, with some leaders calling it immoral and un-American. \n \nTrump's order temporarily bars citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States even if they hold valid visas or permanent residence permits, a move that caught many companies off-guard. \n \nNetflix Inc Chief Executive Reed Hastings called it \"a sad week\" and added: \"It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.\" \n \nApple Inc CEO Tim Cook sent a letter to employees saying Trump's order was \"not a policy we support\" and promised to help affected employees. \n \n\"We have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our coworkers and our company,\" Cook added. \n \nElon Musk, the South African-born founder of Tesla and SpaceX who met recently with Trump, said on Twitter: \"The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges.\" \n \nAirbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky said: \"Not allowing countries or refugees into America is not right and we must stand with those who are affected.\" \n \nAirbnb will provide free housing to anyone not allowed into the United States, Chesky said. \n \nAaron Levie, the outspoken founder and CEO of online storage company Box Inc, said: \"The executive order on immigration is immoral and antithetical to our values.\" \n \nSTRANDED \n \nFriday's order could be a major headache for tech companies, potentially leaving employees stranded overseas and unable to return to the United States. \n \nAlphabet Inc's Google urgently called back employees from overseas and told ones who might be affected by the ban not to leave the United States. \n \nCEO Sundar Pichai said in an email to staff that more than 100 Google employees were affected by the order, according to a Google executive. \n \nOne Google employee of Iranian nationality with legal U.S. residency made it back to the United States just hours before the order took effect, the executive said. \n \n\"We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S.,\" Google said in a statement. \n \nMicrosoft Corp President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a company-wide email posted on LinkedIn that 76 company employees were citizens of the seven countries in question and held U.S. work visas, and thus were directly affected by the order. \n \nHe said the company had not determined how many people with green cards, or permanent residence status, might be affected. \n \n\"As a company, Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system,\" Smith said in the post. \"We believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings.\" \n \nUber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick, who has faced criticism from some employees for participating in President Trump's business advisory council, said in a statement that the company would compensate drivers from the seven countries who might not be able to return to the United States for three months or more. He said the company knew of about a dozen affected employees. \n \n\"This ban will impact many innocent people - an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump\u2019s first business advisory group meeting,\" Kalanick said. \n \nFacebook Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on Friday that was \"concerned\" about the order and voiced support for immigrants. \n \n- Reuters \n < Prev  Next >","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"U.S. Tech Leaders Sound Alarm Over Trump Immigration Order","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"MY","country":"Malaysia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Malaysian Digest","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"304117844","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"21"},"name":"Malaysian Digest","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.malaysiandigest.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196494601","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:55:11Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada,\" Trudeau said on Twitter. \n \nA second tweet, also timed to coincide with outrage over Trump's immigration policy, included a 2015 photo of Trudeau welcoming a Syrian refugee at a Canadian airport. \n \nConfusion abounded at airports around the world on Saturday as officials tried to interpret the new U.S. rules. \n \nTrudeau's office said U.S. authorities had confirmed Canadian passport holders, including dual citizens from the seven countries, would not be affected. \n \nTrudeau has walked a fine line with the Trump administration, avoiding direct criticism while promoting the progressive policies of his one-year-old Liberal government. \n \nThe prime minister would discuss Canada's immigration and refugee policies with Trump, Trudeau's press secretary, Cameron Ahmad, said. He did not say when that would be. \n \nWestJet Airlines said it turned back a passenger bound for the United States on Saturday to comply with Trump's executive order but did not say which country the passenger had come from. Spokeswoman Lauren Stewart said the airline would give full refunds to anyone affected. \n \nIn the western province of Saskatchewan, Iranian doctoral student Mohammadreza Tayfeh found himself comforting the Delta Air Lines employee he called about a refund. \n \n\"I said, 'It's all right. It's going to be fine. Don't worry about it.' She was so upset,\" he said in an interview from Saskatoon. \n \nTayfeh, an engineering student living in Canada for seven years, had been invited to San Diego to meet with investors for his telecom business. While he had a visitor's visa, he missed the cutoff to travel by hours. \n \nHe decided not to risk flying from Saskatchewan in case he was detained on arrival in the United States. He said an Iranian friend who has been living in the U.S. and working at NASA for years was detained at the Doha airport in Qatar late Friday. \n \n\"You don't want to put yourself in that situation, to go there and they ask you questions and just deport you,\" he said. \n \nIn Vancouver, an employee at the American Airlines counter said one person traveling on an Iranian passport had been turned away Saturday morning. \n \nAir Canada said it was complying with the order but did not comment on whether it had denied anyone travel. \n \nA Porter Airlines spokesman said the Toronto-based carrier will be restricting passengers from traveling to the United States from the listed countries until further notice. \n \n- Reuters \n < Prev  Next >","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Canada's Trudeau Welcomes Refugees; U.S.-Bound Passengers Turned Away","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"MY","country":"Malaysia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Malaysian Digest","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"304117844","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"21"},"name":"Malaysian Digest","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.malaysiandigest.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196494805","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:05:38Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The economy grew at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter. \n \nThe slowdown masked a surge in home building spending and a rebound in business investment on equipment after four straight quarterly declines. \n \nThe economy expanded 1.6 percent for all of 2016, the worst performance since 2011, as it struggled with weak oil prices, a strong dollar and efforts by businesses to reduce a large inventory overhang. \n \nU.S. President Donald Trump vowed during last year's election campaign to deliver 4 percent annual GDP growth, largely on the back of a plan to cut taxes, reduce regulations and increase infrastructure spending. \n \n\"The details of the report were quite sound. The U.S. economic expansion got its mojo back and the momentum appears to be carrying over into 2017,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. \n \nA measure of private domestic demand increased at a 2.8 percent rate last quarter. Economic growth in the third quarter was driven in part by an outsized jump in soybean exports. \n \nExcluding soybeans, GDP increased at about a 2.7 percent rate in both the third and fourth quarters, according to analysts. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter. \n \nIn the first half of 2016, weak corporate profits because of cheaper oil and the robust dollar undercut business spending. The inventory correction resulted in companies placing fewer orders with manufacturers. The economy grew 2.6 percent in 2015. \n \nWith oil prices rising and global demand picking up, the economy appears set for continued expansion. A labor market at or near full employment also is starting to lift wages and is supporting consumer spending. \n \nAlthough Trump has offered little detail on his economic policy, his promises have been embraced by consumers, businesses and investors. Consumer and business confidence have soared, while the U.S. stock market has rallied to record highs. \n \nA separate report on Friday showed consumer sentiment hitting a 13-year high in January. \n \n\"While the size and the timing of the tax cut, infrastructure spending and regulatory rollback are uncertain, economic growth could double during the second half of the year,\" said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo. \n \nBut uncertainty over the Trump administration's trade policy and sustained dollar strength pose a risk to the economy. \n \nSOYBEANS REVERSAL \n \nIn the fourth quarter, exports fell at a 4.3 percent rate, reversing the 10 percent increase notched in the third quarter. The fourth-quarter drop in exports was the biggest since the first quarter of 2015. \n \nAt the same time, rising domestic demand drew in imports, which increased at their quickest pace in two years. The resulting trade deficit sliced 1.70 percentage points from GDP growth, the biggest drag since the second quarter of 2010. \n \nMost of the hit came from soybean exports, which fired up GDP growth in the third quarter after a poor harvest in Argentina and Brazil. Trade added 0.85 percentage point to GDP in the third quarter. \n \nThe dollar .DXY firmed against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly lower after surging to record highs during the week. Prices for U.S. government debt rose. \n \nA stronger economy would mean further interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve. The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate hikes this year. It raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. \n \nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 2.5 percent rate in the fourth quarter. The moderation from the third quarter's brisk 3.0 percent pace came amid modest household income gains. \n \nIncome at the disposal of households after accounting for taxes and inflation increased 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter after rising 2.6 percent rise in the prior period. Savings fell to $791.2 billion from $818.1 billion in the third quarter. \n \nWith domestic demand rising, businesses accumulated inventories at a rate of $48.7 billion in the last quarter, up from $7.1 billion in the third quarter. Inventories added 1.0 percentage point to GDP growth, double the contribution in the third quarter. \n \nBusiness investment pushed higher, with spending on equipment increasing at a 3.1 percent rate, the first increase in over a year. The gain reflected a surge in gas and oil well drilling, in tandem with rising crude oil prices. \n \nSpending on mining exploration, wells and shafts increased at a 24.3 percent rate after declining at a 30.0 percent pace in the third quarter. Energy services firm Baker Hughes said last Friday that U.S. energy companies added 29 oil rigs in the week to Jan. 20, bringing the total count to 551 - the most since November 2015. \n \nInvestment in nonresidential structures, however, fell at a 5.0 percent pace in the fourth quarter after rising at a 12.0 percent rate in the prior period. \n \nInvestment in home building rose at a 10.2 percent rate, rebounding after two straight quarterly declines. Government spending picked up as a rise in state and local government investment offset a decline in federal government expenditures. \n \n- Reuters","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"U.S. Economy Slows On Wider Trade Gap; Business Spending Rises","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"MY","country":"Malaysia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Malaysian Digest","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"304117844","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"21"},"name":"Malaysian Digest","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.malaysiandigest.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196495613","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:02Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And then his god-given talent can become a lot better.\"\n\nGilbert's been a successful coach, having helped Andre Agassis win six of eight major titles.\n\nHe led Andy Roddick to his 2003 US Open triumph and also worked with current No.1 Andy Murray and Kei Nishikori.\n\nWhen pressed on whether he'd been keen to work with the 21-year-old, Gilbert didn't rule it out.\n\n\"I've never spent time with him, so that would be the first thing ... you never say never about anything, you never know,\" he said.\n\nStubbs, who won four grand slam doubles titles during her career, said because Kyrgios was a \"special person\" he was the only one who could decide on who his coach should be.\n\nKyrgios has been linked with Roger Rasheed, Lleyton Hewitt and Radek Stepanek, although the latter is still playing.\n\nBut Stubbs felt the decision he was facing was much more than just whether to get a coach and if so who, but just how good he wanted to be.\n\nIf he wanted to be great, like the Australian Open men's singles finalists Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, then it was up to him.\n\n\"He's a special person. He will have to make this decision on his own,\" Stubbs said.\n\n\"It's kind of like when someone's an alcoholic, at some point your family and friends around you are saying you've got to stop drinking, but at some point you're the one that has to make the decision to do it.\n\n\"And he has to make the decision in himself that he wants to be great and it's hard being a great tennis player.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"David Polkinghorne"},"topics":[{"name":"Media latest","group":"Media"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Brad Gilbert says Nick Kyrgios can be world No.1 - if he gets a coach","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2650","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Wagga Wagga","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Riverina Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"351642178","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Riverina Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Media"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.riverinaleader.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"video","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196496101","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:56Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/77838a16-4f05-43de-99aa-48e88bb5f664.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

By 12.30am she had carted her seventh Daphne Akhurst trophy back outside, to squeeze in one last pose for the photographers.\n\nBy lunchtime on Sunday she was on her way home; the tennis circus doesn't pause for record holders or even let them get much sleep. \"I'm leaving,\" said Williams, asking if she would stick around for Federer v Nadal. \"Man, I got to watch that match.\"\n\nFans were ready for Williams to win her 23rd grand slam title, and break her tie with Steffi Graf. They had been ready for a while.\n\nSerena wore red and black Nike Jordan boots featuring the No. 23 for the post-match presentation (you can also buy them in pink), Berlei had a new ad ready to run on social media and straight after the match Williams signed a set of gold racquets made by Wilson, strung to her specifications and featuring a 24-carat trapdoor on the butt cap. On sale for $960, with all proceeds headed for her foundation. All 23 were sold online within minutes.\n\nNone of this is to say that Serena is done, or satisfied. Graf was 30 when she retired, fresh off her first grand slam finals in three years at Roland Garros and Wimbledon in 1999, but with a hamstring injury and a lost love for the sport. Williams was 35 when she beat her older sister Venus on Saturday night, and plans to enjoy this one. \"It's a great number. I know she would like to have a little more,\" said Venus, while Serena conceded that it had sat somewhere at the back of her mind since she was 22.\n\n\"I guess after Wimbledon,\" said Williams, who went on to lose her US Open semi-final to Karolina Pliskova last year. Those Nikes had been sitting in a cupboard somewhere since. \"I obviously was thinking, 'OK, the next one.' I got it so fast, it didn't stay on the radar so long.\"\n\nSo is No. 24 \u2013 the Margaret Court pre-Open era record \u2013 just around the corner? \"No,\" said Williams. She hasn't forgotten: it took a year and three tough losses to creep from 21 up to 22. \"One thing I learned in the past is you have to enjoy it. That's the beauty of winning Australia, you have a few months to relax. If you win the French it's like back-to-back-to-back. Australia, you have time to enjoy the moment before the next grand slam.\"\n\nWilliams met Court in Perth last year for a \"really interesting\" chat, but grew up watching Graf, Monica Seles, Pete Sampras and can remember feeling inspired as a nine-year-old by Zina Garrison's run to the Wimbledon final. Now she knows that she, Graf and Navratilova are \"hands down leading the conversation\" when it comes to talk about which player is the greatest of all time.\n\n\"Yeah, just one thing about a champion, they keep fighting, they keep going,\" she said. \"I just feel like those four really are incredible fighters. They're mentally tough as well. They always kept going. It's something that I learned from them a lot, is how to hopefully do the same, which hopefully I've been able to do.\"\n\nSo what's next. A \"Serena Slam\"? Nope. \"A Serena Slam doesn't start in Australia,\" Williams said. \"It starts any other Grand Slam outside of Australia.\"\n\nA regular 'slam? \"I don't think about that either.\" How about one of the best-ever sporting stories to tell? Venus can answer that one for her. \"I don't think we're going for the greatest story in sports,\" she said. \"We're just going for some dreams. In the case that we are, what an honour, what an honour.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Emma Quayle"},"topics":[{"name":"Media latest","group":"Media"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Australian Open 2017: With title No.23 in the bag, Serena Williams packs hers and heads home","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2650","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Wagga Wagga","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Riverina Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"351642178","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Riverina Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Media"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.riverinaleader.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"video","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196496277","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:29:36Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/508d4b23-e743-4cb9-b31f-15b5660a912c.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Dhoni had an endorsement agreement with the company which had expired in December 2012. \n \nEarlier, the court had asked Maxx to give details of the steps taken by it to remove cricketer\u2019s name and photograph from its social media sites including its website and Facebook. \n \nThe November 2014 direction was passed on a plea by Mr. Dhoni and Rhiti Sports, alleging that Maxx Mobilink had not paid dues worth crores of rupees which was agreed upon for using the cricketer\u2019s name on their products. \n \nM.S. Dhoni\u2019s counsel had said the endorsement agreement between him and the company had expired in December 2012 but Maxx was still using his name to sell its products and not paying him the dues. \n \nThe cricketer, in his contempt plea, has also sought a direction to seize all the products/mobile handsets and such other articles where his name and image is being used to sell and promote these products.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Mobile industry news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Wireless industry news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"1hr Dhoni alleges misuse of name by mobile company","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"The Hindu","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169592117","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"917"},"name":"The Hindu","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hindu.com","publisher":"The Hindu Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196496841","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Her speech was much shorter, the curtain raiser really, and - while enthusiastically received - it hit no great heights. \n \nBy comparison Little's was more forceful and more personal. \n \nHe didn't endorse her for deputy, or any other role for that matter. \n \nShe was unequivocal in backing him as prime minister and went so far as to praise him as the sort of \"straight up, decent guy\" the country needed as its next leader after some strong words about \"calling out\" United States President Donald Trump at the post-event media scrum. \n \nIn fact there was clearly strong common ground between them on refugees and what Little called \"a better path than isolation and bigotry\" represented by politicians like Trump - who at times was an almost palpable presence in the packed hall. \n \nWarm-up act comedian Guy Williams referred to him as the \"man who shall not be named\" and the sign language translator got one of the biggest laughs with her sign for Trump - a sort of up-flick of the hand above the forehead, in an obvious reference to his comb-forward. \n \nBoth also launched into Prime Minister Bill English over similar issues; his planned no-show at Waitangi, leadership and his response when asked if he was a feminist. \n \nDespite obvious differences on issue like membership of the Five Eyes security network - now with Trump's America - neither fell into any hostile disagreement during post-match media quizzing. \n \nAs election year symbolism of their closer cooperation it was all they could have hoped for. \n \nNow the game moves on to the February 25 Mt Albert by-election to ensure the Jacinda Ardern-Julie Anne Genter face-off does not allow their acknowledged competition to trump their public show of affectionate cooperation. \n \n ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"VERNON SMALL"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Labour-Greens carry off State of the Nation double-act","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southland Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169697795","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Southland Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196498815","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Immigration lawyers, activists and Democratic politicians reacted furiously, and many worked to help marooned travelers find a way back home. \n \nIn Brooklyn, the American Civil Liberties Union sought to block the order in an emergency hearing, a large crowd chanting \"Let them stay, it's the American way!\u201d outside the courthouse. \n \nHundreds of protesters gathered at airports in Dallas, Chicago, New York and elsewhere while inside, anxious family members waited and worried for travelers. \n \nAt Chicago O'Hare International Airport, brothers Bardia and Ayden Noohi waited for four hours for their father Kasra Noohi -who has an Iranian passport and a U.S. green card - to be allowed through. \n \nThey knew Mr. Trump had pledged tougher rules but did not expect they would affect holders of green cards, which allow foreigners to live and work in the United States. \n \n\u201cI didn't thing he'd actually do it,\u201d Bardia Noohi (32), said. \u201cA lot of politicians just talk.\u201d \n \nMr. Trump, who took office just over a week ago, had promised during his campaign what he called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d to do more to protect Americans from terror attacks. \n \nHe told reporters in the Oval Office that his order was \u201cnot a Muslim ban\u201d and said the measures were long over due. \n \n\u201cIt's working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \n \n\u201cWe're going to have a very, very strict ban and we're going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\u201d \n \nCHAOS \n \nThe ban affects travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Green card holders will not be allowed back in until they are re-screened. \n \nThe order seeks to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution. In a television interview, Mr. Trump said the measure was aimed at helping Christians in Syria. \n \nConfusion abounded at airports as immigration and customs officials struggled to interpret the new rules, with some legal residents who were in the air when the order was issued detained at airports upon arrival. \n \nA chaotic scene played out in the arrivals terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, where a group of lawyers had filed a lawsuit on behalf of two Iraqi men who had worked for the U.S. military who were in the air when Mr. Trump signed the order. \n \nThousands of refugees seeking entry were thrown into limbo. Melanie Nezer of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a Jewish group that works with refugees, said she knew of roughly 2,000 who were booked to come to the United States next week. \n \nThe U.S. technology industry, a major employer of foreignworkers, hit back on Saturday, with some leaders calling the order immoral and un-American. \n \nColleges also spoke out on behalf of students from the countries, and warned students in the United States that they should avoid travel lest they not be allowed back in. \n \nArab travelers in the Middle East and North Africa said the order was humiliating and discriminatory. It drew criticism from U.S. Western allies including France, Germany and Britain. \n \nIran condemned the order as an \u201copen affront against the Muslim world and the Iranian nation\u201d and vowed to retaliate. Of the seven countries targeted, Iran sends the most visitors to the United States each year - around 35,000 in 2015, according to the Department of Homeland Security. \n \nSudan called the action \u201cvery unfortunate\u201d after Washington lifted sanctions on the country just weeks ago for cooperation on combating terrorism. A Yemeni official expressed dismay at the ban. \n \nCanadians welcome those fleeing persecution, terror and war\"regardless of your faith,\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a Twitter post. \n \nLEGAL RESIDENTS STUNNED \n \nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump promised to clampdown on immigration as a way to prevent attacks. He first proposed a ban on Muslims entering the United States, modifying that later to \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants from certain countries. \n \nIt was unclear how many legal permanent residents would be affected. A senior U.S. administration official said on Saturday that green card holders from the seven affected countries have to be cleared into the United States on a case-by-case basis. \n \nAccording to State Department guidance, travelers who have dual nationality of one of these countries will not be permitted for 90 days to enter the United States. \n \nLegal residents of the United States were plunged into despair at the prospect of being unable to return to the United States or being separated from family members trapped abroad. \n \nIn Cairo, five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an Egypt Air flight to New York on Saturday, sources at Cairo airport said. Dutch airline KLM said on Saturday it had refused carriage to the United States to seven passengers from predominately Muslim countries. \n \nU.S. AGENCIES SCRAMBLE \n \nIn Washington, the agencies charged with handling immigration and refugee issues grappled with how to interpret the measure, and enforcement was uneven. \n \nU.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were not consulted on the executive order and in some casesonly learned the details as they were made public. \n \nAt the State Department, a senior official said lawyers were working closely with their counterparts at Homeland Security to interpret the executive order, which allows entry to people affected by the order when it is in the \u201cnational interest.\u201d \n \nHowever, a federal law enforcement official said, \u201cIt's unclear at this point what the threshold of national interest is.\u201d \n \nSenior administration officials said it would have been \"reckless\u201d to broadcast details of the order in advance of new security measures. The officials told reporters that Homeland Security now has guidance for airlines. \n \n\u201cI don't think anyone is going to take this lying down,\" said Cleveland immigration lawyer David Leopold. \u201cThis is the tip of the spear and more litigation is coming.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"3hrs Chaos, protests, lawsuit as Trump orders halt on some Muslim immigrants","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"The Hindu","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169592117","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"917"},"name":"The Hindu","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hindu.com","publisher":"The Hindu Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196500586","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport, some of the 2,000 demonstrators there chanted \u201cLet them in, let them in!\u201d \n \nLarge protests took place at the main airports for Washington, Chicago, Minneapolis, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Dallas. \n \nDonnelly\u2019s decision to issue a temporary stay \u2014 which stopped short of ruling on the constitutionality of Trump\u2019s order \u2014 came after dozens of people were detained at US airports following Trump\u2019s actions. \n \nThe exact number of those affected is unclear, but the judge ordered the government to provide lists of all those detained at US airports since the measure went into effect. \n \nSending those travelers back to their home countries following Trump\u2019s order exposes them to \u201csubstantial and irreparable injury,\u201d wrote Donnelly, who was appointed by Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. \n \nA second federal judge in Virginia also issued a temporary order restricting immigration authorities for seven days from deporting legal permanent residents detained at Dulles Airport just outside Washington, according to US media. \n \u2013 \u2018We were prepared\u2019 \u2013  \n\u201cWe knew that was coming \u2014 we were prepared,\u201d said Camille Mackler, a lawyer who heads legal initiatives at the New York Immigration Coalition, one of the groups that quickly mounted the demonstration there. \n \n\u201cBut we didn\u2019t know when, and we couldn\u2019t believe it would be immediate, that there\u2019d be people in an airplane the moment the order was taking effect.\u201d \n \nThe List Project, which helps Iraqis whose personal safety is threatened because they have worked for the United States, expressed outraged over the move, warning it put American lives at risk too. \n \n\u201cI can\u2019t say this in blunt-enough terms: you can\u2019t screw over the people that risked their lives and bled for this country without consequences,\u201d wrote the project\u2019s founder and director Kirk Johnson. \n \nThe ACLU\u2019s legal challenge sought the release of two Iraqi men on grounds of unlawful detention. One of them \u2014 Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who has worked as interpreter and in other roles for the US in Iraq \u2014 was in fact released on Saturday after being detained the day before. \n \u2013 \u2018We must fight\u2019 \u2013  \nDemocratic Representative Jerrold Nadler, who went to JFK to press for the release of those detained under Trump\u2019s measure, said \u201cWe must fight this executive order in the streets, in the courts, anywhere, anytime. We must resist. We must fight.\u201d \n \nTrump\u2019s pronouncement on Muslim immigration makes good on one of his most controversial campaign promises to subject travelers from Islamic countries to \u201cextreme vetting\u201d \u2014 which he declared would make America safe from \u201cradical Islamic terrorists.\u201d \n \nThe targeted countries are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n \nDonnelly\u2019s decision shows that \u201cwhen President Trump enacts laws or executive orders that are unconstitutional, and illegal, the courts are there to defend everyone\u2019s rights,\u201d ACLU executive director Anthony Romero said in leaving the emergency hearing. \n \nThe ban has triggered political backlash, including from Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans. \n \nOrrin Hatch, the most senior Republican in the US Senate, spoke of America\u2019s \u201clegal and moral obligations to help the innocent victims of these terrible conflicts.\u201d \n \n\u201cI strongly urge the new administration to move quickly to tailor its policy on visa issuance as narrowly as possible, delivering on our security needs while reducing unnecessary burdens on the vast majority of visa-seekers that present a promise \u2014 not a threat \u2014 to our nation,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \nConnecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, wrote: \u201cTo my colleagues: don\u2019t ever again lecture me on American moral leadership if you chose to be silent today.\u201d \n \nHis tweet was accompanied by the now iconic photograph of Aylan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian boy whose body washed up on a beach in Turkey in 2015 after a failed attempt to flee Syria\u2019s brutal war to join relatives in Canada. \n \u2013 A long battle \u2013  \nThe rapid mobilization against the order suggests a protracted battle is shaping up between migrant advocates and Trump and his administration. \n \n\u201cThis is the opening salvo of a long battle that will go on in the courts,\u201d said Michael Kagan, a law professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas who specializes in immigration issues. \n \nHe said the outcome of the legal battle is unclear because \u201cwe are in unchartered territory in modern America.\u201d \n \nThe battle could end up in the US Supreme Court, which has not ruled on this type of immigration issue since the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. \n \nA White House official said that holders of a green card \u2014 which allows permanent residence in the US and often takes years to obtain \u2014 who are abroad should first go to the US consulate to obtain a document allowing return to the US. \n \nAnd green card holders in the US who want to travel abroad must obtain approval from a consulate official. \n \nThe State Department has said that people from the seven countries under the 90-day travel ban will be prohibited entry no matter their visa status. Only those holding a dual citizenship with the US will be allowed to enter.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"John Abayomi"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Court stops Trump immigration ban","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Nigeria Punch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658452","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Nigeria Punch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.punchng.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196501468","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:49:14Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Only men footballers have got Arjuna Award for so long, women footballers are not considered worthy of the Arjuna Award. I don\u2019t know why. I feel women footballers should be treated at par with men footballers,\u201d the 36-year-old Bembem told PTI in an interview. \n \nLast year, Subrata Paul, who has played for the country in 64 international matches as the men\u2019s team goalkeeper from 2007 onwards was chosen for the award. \n \nFor the record, out of 24 Indian footballers who have so far been conferred with the Arjuna Award, 23 are men, the only woman player being legendary former Bengal and India captain Shanti Mullick who was bestowed with the honour in 1983. \n \nIn the last two decades, seven Indian footballers have won the Arjuna Award and all of them are men. Among them are stalwarts like I M Vijayan, Bhaichung Bhutia and Sunil Chhetri. \n \nBembem has won two SAFF Championships, two South Asian Games and has been an integral part of the Indian team in various international events like Asian Games, Olympics and and the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers. She has worn the captain\u2019s armband in six international tournaments starting from 2003. \n \nBesides inspiring a generation of Indian women to take up football, especially in powerhouse Manipur and other states of Northeast India, Bembem is also a pioneer as she is the first to feature in a top-flight foreign league by playing for New Radiant Sports Club of Maldives in 2014. \n \nHer club won the Maldives women\u2019s league and became the highest goal-scorer. \n \n\u201cWe (women footballers) also win SAFF Championships, South Asian Games. We played in the Asian Games, qualifying tournaments of the World Cup, Olympics and AFC Asian Cup and we are even higher than men\u2019s team in FIFA rankings but why do only men get Arjuna Award and not women footballers?\u201d she rued. \n \nWhile the Indian men\u2019s team is ranked 129th, the women are placed 54th in the current FIFA rankings.

We went to Australia and learned a lot. We came up against a very strong side and we were a young team. \n \n\"Although it's a few games ago, there is a number of experiences the guys have had between then and now and it's important to put those into practice. \n \n\"Not by trying too hard, by executing plans as best we can.\" \n \nTheir chances of doing just that appear much brighter than they were in 68, 166 and 177-run thrashings in Australia. \n \nThe Black Caps have had some confidence restored by a test series victory over Pakistan and T20, ODI and test series wins against Bangladesh. \n \nBut the most important factors are undoubtedly being back on home turf and the absence of dangerous Australian batting trio David Warner and Usman Khawaja (rested) and captain Steve Smith (injured). \n \nHowever, much like experienced batsman Ross Taylor the day previous, there was more than one reason that didn't have Williamson leaping like Warner celebrating yet another century. \n \n\"From our perspective, you always want to play the best and all three are highly ranked in all formats, but particularly one-day,\" he said. \n \n\"Naturally it changes their side. They are world class players but Australia aren't No 1 in the world for no reason. \n \n\"They have a number of world class players still and very good depth in their country, the guys they've brought in (Aaron Finch and Shaun Marsh) have a lot of international experience and we know we have to be at our best come tomorrow.\" \n \nOne player who will be under extra scrutiny in that sense is New Zealand's Tom Latham. \n \nWilliamson confirmed the opening batsman would take the gloves ahead of the uncapped Tom Blundell after Latham made two stumpings in a tidy display for Canterbury in a domestic one-day clash on Saturday. \n \nLatham has carried out the role for the Black Caps in three ODIs and four Twenty20 matches and although the last of those was in 2013, his extra experience and versatility, which allows an extra all-rounder to be picked in the middle order, got him the nod. \n \nWilliamson also confirmed Neil Broom would bat at No 5 behind Latham, Martin Guptill, himself and Ross Taylor but said they wanted another look at the Eden Park pitch when the covers came off on Monday morning before locking in their 11. \n \n\"It looks like another good surface, pretty good for batting,\" he said. \n \n\"However if you put the ball in the right area on drop-in wickets at times it can build pressure. \n \n\"Obviously there is the small boundaries but sometimes that can lure players in and we've seen low scoring, tight games here on good surfaces. \n \n\"It will be interesting to see how it plays and how the game unfolds.\" \n \nAT A GLANCE \n \nWhat: Chappell-Hadlee ODI series, game one \nWhere: Eden Park, Auckland \nWhen: Monday, 11am start \n \nLikely teams: \n \nNew Zealand: Tom Latham, Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson (c), Ross Taylor, Neil Broom, Colin Munro, Jimmy Neesham, Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Lockie Ferguson, Trent Boult \n \nAustralia: Aaron Finch, Shaun Marsh, Peter Handscomb, Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade (c), James Faulkner, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood. \n \n ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"CLAY WILSON"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Kane doesn't deal in redemption","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"The Press NZ","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"189987471","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"The Press NZ","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Cricket","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196516445","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In addition, it specifically bars Syrian refugees from the US indefinitely, or until the president himself decides that they no longer pose a threat. \n \nMeanwhile, no visas will be issued for 90 days to migrants or visitors from seven mainly-Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n \nFirst would-be migrants to US grounded in Cairo \n \nCairo airport officials say seven US-bound migrants, six from Iraq and one from Yemen, have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's JFK airport. \n \nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries. \n \nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the UN refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n \nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief the media. \n \nExtreme vetting \n \nDuring the suspensions of the refugee and visa programmes, new rules will be devised for what Trump has called the \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of applicants' backgrounds. \n \nSome exceptions will be made for members of \u201creligious minorities\u201d, which \u2014 in the countries targeted by the decree \u2014 would imply favourable treatment for Christians. \n \nCivil liberties groups and many counterterror experts condemned the measures, declaring it inhumane to lump the victims of conflict in with the extremists who threaten them. \n \n\u201c'Extreme vetting' is just a euphemism for discriminating against Muslims,\u201d said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. \n \nRomero argued that, by choosing countries with Muslim majorities for tougher treatment, Trump's order breaches the US Constitution's ban on religious discrimination. \n \nAhmed Rehab, director of the Chicago chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said his group would mount legal challenges to fight the order \u201ctooth and nail\u201d. \n \n\u201cIt is targeting people based on their faith and national origin, and not on their character or their criminality,\u201d he told AFP. \n \nMalala Yousafzai, the Pakistani activist and Nobel peace laureate who was shot in the head by the Taliban in 2012, said she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d. \n \nShe urged Trump not to abandon the world's \u201cmost defenseless children and families\u201d. But the measure will be popular with Trump's nationalist base, and stops short of a threat made during last year's campaign to halt all Muslim travel to the US. \n \nTrump's supporters defend the measures as necessary to prevent supporters of Al Qaeda or the militant Islamic State (IS) group from infiltrating the US homeland disguised as refugees. \n \nAnd the State Department, which with the Department of Homeland Security will have to implement the measures, said it was ready to put them into immediate effect. \n \n\u201cWe will announce any changes affecting travellers to the United States as soon as that information is available,\u201d spokesman Mark Toner said. \n \n\u201cWe take seriously our responsibility to safeguard the American public while remaining committed to assisting the world's most vulnerable people.\u201d \n \n'Wonderful thing' \n \nTrump signed the order \u2014 which will cut the number of refugees the US plans to resettle this fiscal year from 110,000 to 50,000 \u2014 in a ceremony at the Pentagon. \n \nMoments earlier, he had signed an order to \u201crebuild\u201d the US military and had watched Vice President Mike Pence swear in respected former Marine general James Mattis as his new secretary of defence. \n \nTrump showered Mattis with praise and had earlier admitted he would allow the general's opposition to the use of torture to override his own enthusiasm for harsh measures. \n \nIn what was a busy day from Trump, one week after his inauguration, he also met with Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May, the first foreign leader to visit his White House. \n \nHe hailed the \u201cmost special relationship\u201d between the twin Atlantic powers and praised Britain's decision to leave the European Union as a \u201cwonderful thing\u201d. \n \n\u201cWhen it irons out, you're going to have your own identity, and you are going to have the people that you want in your country,\u201d Trump said, in a nod to his own immigration stance. \n \n\u201cYou're going to be able to make free trade deals without having somebody watching you and what you are doing.\u201d \n \nMay conveyed an invitation from Queen Elizabeth II for Trump to come to Britain for a state visit this year, and thanked him for his \u201c100 per cent\u201d support of Nato. \n \nOver the weekend, Trump is due to make calls to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russia's President Vladimir Putin, France's President Francois Hollande and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. \n \nHe is keen to develop friendly ties with Moscow, but played down reports that he might quickly end US economic sanctions imposed on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Kashmir Observer"},"topics":[{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump bars visitors from 7 Muslim nations","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Kashmir Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667694","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Kashmir Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kashmirobserver.in"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196517205","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T09:45:16Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://images.kashmirobserver.in/assets/container/styles/medium/public/media/article-images/2017/04/trumpsigningorder.jpg?itok=3rqQDvwJ"}],"video":[]}}

He notes that he won in the end.\n\nNow the former Liberal, who left the party in 2014 after leaked emails revealed his disparaging and sexist comments about a female Sydney City councillor, is gunning for Nationals MP Michael Johnsen\u2019s seat of Upper Hunter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have some fun,\u201d said Mr Preston, 47, at Elderslie on Friday of his role as Shooters, Fishers and Farmers spokesman for the Hunter, and his run as party candidate against Mr Johnsen at the 2019 NSW election, despite not owning a gun.\n\nThe Upper Hunter is the first of what Shooters, Fishers and Farmers state director Filip Despotoski describes as \u201cwinnable\u201d NSW seats held by Nationals MPs that will be targeted by the party.\n\nIn the 2015 election Mr Johnsen suffered a 20 per cent swing against him after a strong showing by Country Labor candidate and Muswellbrook mayor Martin Rush, leaving the Nationals with a marginal seat after continuously holding the Upper Hunter since 1931.\n\nThe Shooters unveiled plans for the region a day before NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian travelled to Tamworth, and then to Queanbeyan on Sunday, as part of a campaign to \u201creconnect\u201d with regional NSW after the disastrous impact of the Baird Government\u2019s greyhound and council amalgamation decisions in the regions.\n\nMr Preston on Friday used \u201cscandalous\u201d Upper Hunter education figures to declare the seat had \u201cendured years of benign neglect\u201d under the Nationals.\n\n\u201cI looked at the education figures where you\u2019ve got more than 70 per cent of children in some schools in the bottom quarter of students in the state, and I thought \u2018This isn\u2019t bad, this is horrific\u2019,\u201d Mr Preston said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re being completely let down by the education system, the National Party and their local MP. These figures are nothing less than scandalous. That will be one of our highest priorities, to address the woeful education outcomes. If you repeated these Upper Hunter numbers in Sydney it would be viewed as some kind of emergency. That is going to stop. We are going to make it stop.\u201d\n\nMr Preston said he was moving to Muswellbrook from Sydney in February. He knew the area after project managing construction of Muswellbrook Fair shopping centre and managing it for several years from 2007. He grew up in the Cowra area, trained as an accountant and worked as a tax specialist in the 1990s.\n\nIt was during this time he was involved in landmark High Court cases dealing with state and territory excises \u2013 first involving X-rated films in a case against the ACT Government, and the second involving tobacco excises against the NSW Government.\n\nThe states and territories lost the second case in 1997, and overnight the basis on which they had levied excises of $4.9 billion a year on tobacco, alcohol and petrol ended. The Federal Government was forced to intervene, collect the funds and return them to the states. Within weeks the Federal Government was considering a report that concluded: \u201cThe present crisis may be the stimulus required to undertake major restructuring of the present pattern of consumption taxation.\u201d\n\nMr Preston confirmed that in 1996 he was arrested and charged with money laundering and conspiring to defraud the State of NSW of $7 million in excises based on his business of buying and selling cigarettes. He and six others were charged despite the earlier launch of the High Court case challenging the rights of the states to charge the tobacco excises.\n\nIn a Fairfax Media report of the controversial case, which included the bugging of Mr Preston\u2019s home, it was noted: \u201cWhen the High Court found the fees were in fact unlawful, the charges against Preston and the six others evaporated.\u201d \n\nMr Preston said it was \u201cnice to be at the centre of a seismic shift in Australian economic life. I\u2019m used to being around the big stuff\u201d.\n\nHe left the Liberal Party in 2014 after publicity about leaked emails between himself and the then Sydney City councillor Edward Mandla in which Mr Preston called a female councillor a \u201ccompany tart\u201d and an \u201cidiot\u201d.\n\nMr Preston was present at a meeting with Mr Mandla and Shooters, Fishers and Farmers MP Robert Borsak \u2013 who is also an accountant - which eventually led to controversial changes in Sydney City Council elections that gave two votes to businesses. \n\nMr Preston said he joined the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party because it was \u201ca party of policy\u201d, and despite not owning a gun. He planned to buy one, he said.\n\nHe wanted to challenge the Nationals in the seat of Upper Hunter because of evidence of obvious disadvantage in the area, despite the mining boom.\n\n\u201cWe have a view how we want to see the Upper Hunter go forward, especially for young people. For young people at the moment the best part of the Upper Hunter is the road out. We want to give young people aged 18 to 35 a reason to stay,\u201d Mr Preston said.\n\nMr Despotoski said the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party had \u201cvery active branches\u201d in Muswellbrook, Scone and Newcastle. Running a strong candidate in the Upper Hunter would benefit the area, he said.\n\n\u201cOne of the best things that can happen for this area is John running, whether he wins or not, because this is a winnable seat and the Nationals are going to have to fight. We will be looking at running candidates anywhere in regional NSW we think we can win,\u201d Mr Despotoski said.\n\nMichael Johnsen did not respond to Newcastle Herald questions.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2582","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Yass","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Yass Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169699270","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Yass Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.yasstribune.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196520573","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

When he's hurt he throws a lot more punches. He's got a lot of heart,\" Berchelt said. \"But I came here to win. I came here to show I have heart. I came here to be the champion.\" \n\nBerchelt, 25, improved to 31-1 with his 28th early stoppage and 10th consecutive victory while Vargas, 32, fell to 23-1 with two drawn. \n\n\"This is what I always wanted,\" Berchelt said. \"I'm young. I'm hungry. I wanted to be a world champion. Now I have the belt on my waist and it feels the best.\" \n\nJapan's Takashi Miura, who lost the title to Vargas 14 months ago, knocked out Mexico's Miguel Roman 53 seconds into the 12th round on the undercard at Indio, California, to become Berchelt's mandatory title challenger. \n\nBerchelt, fighting outside Mexico for only the second time, repeatedly connected with punishing left hooks in the second and third rounds. His hard rights to the head in the fourth again slowed Vargas, opening cuts over both eyes in the exchanges. \n\nGoing past the sixth round for the first time in his career, Berchelt kept up the intensity. Caiz and ringside doctor Paul Wallace checked Vargas in the ninth and 10th rounds and allowed him to continue. \n\nBlood began flowing freely from the gash over Vargas's swollen left eye in the ninth and by the 11th was more than the champion could overcome. \n\n\"The cut was a big problem. It wouldn't let me do what I wanted,\" Vargas said. \"I was never going to stop. I was always going to fight. I'm a warrior. I fight 'til the end. \n\n\"But it was just the blood. I couldn't see.

Miura's left eye began swelling in the fourth round and both fighters landed punishing body blows. \n\nRoman connected with a punishing right to Miura's jaw in the sixth, setting up a flurry by the Mexican that weakened the former champion. \n\nThe Asian southpaw suffered a bloody lip but fired back in the seventh with renewed vigor, trading powerful punches. \n\nRoman suffered a cut over his left eye in the eighth on an accidental head-butt from Miura, who exchanged hard punches in the ninth and buckled the Mexican momentarily in the 10th. \n\nMiura knocked down Roman late in the 10th with a sledgehammer left hand to the body and dropped Roman again in the 11th with a flurry of body punches. \n\nEarly in the 12th round, Miura landed a left to the head that left Roman lying on the canvas and referee Tom Taylor counted him out.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: boxing news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Berchelt dethrones Vargas","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"SuperSport.co.za","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"611212512","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"SuperSport.co.za","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Boxing","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://supercricket.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196520981","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But generally speaking it's already set for the whole season.\" \n \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n \n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n \n\"That's her motivation. This won't change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That's enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n \nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n \n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n \n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"SuperSport.co.za","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"611212512","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"SuperSport.co.za","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://supercricket.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196521181","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The news agency said that the Russian authorities commenced a \u201clarge-scale\u201d investigation into the circumstances of the death of the former KGB and FSB chief. \n  \n\u201cA large-scale investigation has been commenced in the area. Erovinkin\u2019s body was sent to the FSB morgue.\u201d \n  \nAccording to the Russian authorities, preliminary postmortem examination found no cause of death, but investigations were still ongoing.

But they admitted that they found no evidence supporting the lurid allegations against Trump. Media outlets that investigated the claims also said they found no evidence that the alleged \u201cgolden shower\u201d video exists. \n \nBuzzFeed came under heavy criticism from its peers for publishing the dossier after admitting that the claims were unsubstantiated. \n \nIn a recent blog post, Christo Grocev, a Bulgarian expert in Russians security issues, claimed it was likely that Erovinkin was the source close to Sechin that Steele referred to in his report. \n \n\u201cInsiders have described Erovinkin to me alternately as \u2018Sechin\u2019s treasurer\u2019 and \u2018the go-between between Putin and Sechin,'\u201d Grocev wrote. \u201cOne thing that everyone seems to agree \u2014 both in public and private sources \u2014 is that Erovinkin was Sechin\u2019s closest associate.\u201d \n \n\u201cI have no doubt that at the time Erovinkin died, Putin had Steele\u2019s Trump dossier on his desk,\u201d Grocev continued. \u201cHe would \u2013 arguably \u2013 have known whether the alleged\u2026 story is based on fact or fiction.\u201d \n  \n\u201c[Putin] had a motive to seek and find the mole. He would have had to conclude that Erovinkin was at least a person of interest.\u201d \n  \nBut, according to the Telegraph , some experts in Russian security issues have expressed skepticism about the theory that Erovinkin was murdered by the Russian state to cover up the truth about the Trump dossier. According to some experts, it is unlikely that Putin would have ordered the assassination of a senior official in the circumstances and manner that rumors suggested. \n \n[Featured Image by Alexander Nemenov/AP Images]","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Former KGB Chief Who Allegedly Helped To Compile 'Golden Shower' Dossier On Donald Trump Found Dead","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Inquisitr","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169676540","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"213"},"name":"Inquisitr","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.inquisitr.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/27/mystery-death-ex-kgb-chief-linked-mi6-spys-dossier-donald-trump/","https://t.co/MdWIow3kIB","https://twitter.com/hashtag/OlegErovinkin?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/kompromat?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/FSB?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/Russia?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/MI6?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/TBD?src=hash","https://twitter.com/Anna_ohlala/status/825555482685235200","https://t.co/IpR0jc4V55","https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheResistance?src=hash","https://twitter.com/noclosedminds/status/825428651072245760","https://twitter.com/hashtag/KGB?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/chief?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/helped?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/spy?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/compile?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/dossier?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/dead?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lexus?src=hash","https://t.co/NGsN54fBdR","https://t.co/ytJiiF4GUt","https://twitter.com/zeusFanHouse/status/825418412130201601","https://t.co/gMODfeIBcP","https://twitter.com/thus_spake/status/825565522427252737","https://cgrozev.wordpress.com/author/christogrozev/"],"sequenceId":"695196525711","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:11Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I am from a polygamous home, and I am the last of my mother\u2019s five children. My mother raised us single-handedly because she lived apart from my dad. \n \nEducation \n \nI studied Communication Arts at the Lagos State University, Ojo. I interned at LTV8 and learnt a lot about journalism there. I would have become a newscaster, but the love and passion I developed for acting made me pursue a career in acting.  Incidentally, my father used to be an actor with the Awarawa Theatre Group. He performed   alongside people like Jide Kosoko. \n \nActing \n \nI began my acting career in 2006 under the tutelage of Ray Eyiwunmi Organisation. Even though my mother never wanted me to become an actress, my father supported me when I made my intention to become an actress known. With time, I was able to convince her that I would do well as an actress. Lasun Ray Eyiwunmi was the first person who believed in me and I remain grateful to him. \n \nNickname \n \nI got the nickname, Omo Butty , from a movie of the same title. The movie was produced by me and I acted the lead role. It was a hit with fans and they loved my performance in the film. \n \nChallenges \n \nSome of the earliest challenges include sleeping on location for days without good food and other things. Sometimes, we go as far as Akwa Ibom State to shoot, and you know one is not used to their food there. \n \nBreakthrough \n \nThe first movie I acted in was Oro Oka , but the movie that shot me to limelight was Tolani Osinrin . I have also appeared in several movies such as Star Boy, Temi Yemi, among others. \n \nProducer \n \nI have produced eight movies so far including Ife si were, Folashade, Ore, Omo Butty, Aturota, among others. I used to produce one movie per year but I have not done so in the past three years, because of the problem of piracy. It is killing Nollywood and I don\u2019t want to do a sub-standard job. The state of the economy is also not helping matters, considering the fact that we spend a lot of money in shooting movies. Because of that, producers have to cut cost, and I am not ready to do that. \n \nLessons learnt \n \nWhile I was with Ray Eyiwunmi Organisation, I learnt that the show must always go on no matter what happens. As an actor, you must be focused and disciplined. Before getting into the industry, I was temperamental but I have since learnt how to be patient and take whatever comes my way. Back then, we were also taught that you must be able to undress anywhere and change into costumes because you can be called to perform anywhere and anytime. You also need to have a good body; that way you can play any role and would not feel bad about undressing when there is a need to do so. \n \nScandals \n \nI prefer to focus on my career, and I don\u2019t like to discuss my personal life. However, Kunle Adegbite is a colleague and friend; that we are often seen together does not mean we are dating. Regarding the man who claimed that he slept with me; he later confessed that we have never met. That incident actually affected the way I relate with fans. Now, I am very careful about accepting gifts from male fans. Some people will offer you gifts as fans, and they will go behind your back to say something else. And you know after a fan has given you a gift, it will be difficult to snub the person. \n \nRomance \n \nAs regards marriage, keep your fingers crossed as anything can happen at any time.  My ideal man must be handsome, God-fearing and caring. \n \nFashion \n \nFashion is about looking good and being comfortable at the same time. I don\u2019t wear what I am not comfortable in. Depending on my mood, I can do without make-up and other things. I love wristwatches and I spend quite a lot on them. I don\u2019t leave home without my small Bible and phone. \n \nRelaxation \n \nI love travelling, but when I am in the country, I could lodge in a hotel and spend the weekend there. \n \nCopyright PUNCH.                 \nAll rights reserved.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"David Ellery"},"topics":[{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Werriwa Wiener dash claims world dachsund record","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2620","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Queanbeyan","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Queanbeyan Age","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"351642098","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"The Queanbeyan Age","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.queanbeyanage.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196533492","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:10:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/01e2e8d0-6ac5-4e81-9bc2-708dc395bfb7.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

If we get 1 on 1, I\u2019m going your way so you\u2019d better win,\u201d\u2019 Webb said. \u201cAnd he did. He won multiple times.\u201d \n \nWebb spread the ball around to other receivers like Mississippi State\u2019s Fred Ross as well. The Pac-12 Conference\u2019s leading passer directed scoring drives on all three of his possessions while completing 11 of 16 passes for 165 yards, including a 39-yard touchdown strike on a well-thrown fade to Reynolds. Reynolds had six catches for 96 yards, most of them on that first drive with Webb. \n \nNate Peterman of Pittsburgh had a similarly strong passing performance for the North in the showcase game for senior NFL prospects that actually featured late drama. Peterman fired a 6-yard scoring pass to East Carolina\u2019s Zay Jones with 1:51 left but the North went for two points and a potential lead. \n \nUnder heavy pressure from Chattanooga\u2019s Keionta Davis, Peterman\u2019s pass was deflected and intercepted by BYU\u2019s Harvey Langi. The South ran out the clock from there. \n \nThe week was about auditioning for NFL teams, more than winning, but Peterman said he wanted that last completion \u201cvery bad.\u201d \n \n\u201cYou\u2019re always competitive,\u201d said Peterman, who was 16-of-23 passing for 153 yards and played most of the game. \u201cTo say you can drive down and win the Senior Bowl in the last seconds, that would have been pretty cool. We didn\u2019t get it but it was a great experience still.\u201d \n \nWebb was the game\u2019s overall MVP after passing for 4,295 yards and 37 touchdowns last season as a graduate transfer from Texas Tech. \n \nHe led the South to a touchdown and field goal in the final three minutes of the first half. He and Reynolds proved a prolific combination on the touchdown drive, moving downfield on connections of 21 \u2014 on a third-and-10 play \u2014 and 13 yards before the touchdown. \n \nGame rules require teams to go for two points in the second quarter, and the South\u2019s attempt failed to keep the halftime lead at 9-3. \n \n \nToledo running back Kareem Hunt ran for 118 yards on 15 carries to earn North Outstanding Player Honors, including a 20-yarder and a 43-yarder on back-to-back plays. \n \nThe South\u2019s honoree was Kansas State defensive end Jordan Willis, who forced two fumbles and had a pair of sacks. \n \nThe South committed five turnovers and turned it over on its first three possessions. Saint Francis linebacker Lorenzo Jerome forced a fumble and made two interceptions for the North.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"John Zenor The"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Cal quarterback Davis Webb shines for South in Senior Bowl win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"91106","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Pasadena","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Pasadena Star News","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169702758","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"13"},"name":"Pasadena Star News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.pasadenastarnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196533698","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.pasadenastarnews.com/storyimage/LD/20170128/SPORTS/170129411/AR/0/AR-170129411.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2620","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Queanbeyan","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Queanbeyan Age","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"351642098","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"The Queanbeyan Age","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.queanbeyanage.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196533873","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Melbourne City coaching staff are hopeful that marquee man Tim Cahill will be fit to take his place against local rivals Melbourne Victory in the third A-League derby of the season next Saturday night, a game that will prove pivotal to the finals hopes of both teams who are currently struggling for form.\n\nThe Socceroo star failed to complete an hour in City's latest disappointing performance against Newcastle on Friday when the A-League's rich kids went down to their rather more humble opponents in a game played at Coffs Harbour.\n\nCity officials on Sunday said that they had no major fitness concerns ahead of the derby save for two players, Corey Gameiro and Steve Kuzmanovksi, who have been out all season with serious injuries.\n\nCahill went off after just 64 minutes of the game against Newcastle, replaced by Anthony Caceres as City tried to get back in the game.\n\nHe had been sore before that match, and at his age - he is now 37 - it is to be expected that the unique demands of the Australian league, with its long distance travelling, matches on hard pitches and in warm conditions, might take their toll. He is, however, City's second highest scorer this season with seven goals and he has managed to net big goals at important times in key matches.\n\nThe veteran forward sat on the bench with his leg iced for the remainder as he looked on while City sought, in vain, to overturn the two-goal lead the Jets had taken through former Victory striker Andrew Nabbout.\n\nBruno Fornaroli's penalty was as close as they came, and while it brought the City skipper's personal goal tally this season to 12 and kept him in second place in the race for the golden boot, it didn't do much else.\n\nCity has fallen into a hole since its season high point, the 1-0 FFA Cup final win over Sydney courtesy of a Cahill header. They are the only side to have beaten the runaway league leaders this season, but since that win, on November 30, they have been poor.\n\nIn nine games since they have only won twice and picked up a possible 10 points out of 27. It is now virtually impossible for them to win the Premiers Plate, and if they do not beat Victory on Saturday then they could be dragged into a dogfight to even make the finals if they continue in their current vein of form.\n\nVictory only has one major absentee for the derby - first choice centre half James Donachie, who was shown a red card in the 2-1 home loss to Sydney that virtually extinguished Kevin Muscat's team's hopes of winning the Premiers Plate.\n\nThey go into round 18 11 points behind Sydney, and while they do meet the Sky Blues once more - in Sydney in early March - they would need the front runners to effect a spectacular collapse to catch them.\n\nVictory does have a handy five-point cushion over the fifth placed Brisbane Roar, whose last-gasp Brett Holman winner against Western Sydney Wanderers lifted them into third spot with 27 points, just one ahead of City.\n\nPerth Glory missed a golden opportunity to close the gap on City to just two points when they surprisingly lost to bottom-of-the-table Central Coast, leaving them five points adrift of City with the Jets just a point behind Glory on 20 points.\n\nWellington and the Wanderers both still also have hopes of becoming involved in the finals race as pressure mounts in the final third of the season.\n\nA defeat in the upcoming derby could make life difficult for City, who have a large number of away games in the final weeks of the campaign, and see the big spending club dragged into a battle for one of the lower level spots in the top six. That wasn't anything anyone was predicting two months ago when they lowered Sydney's colours to win their first ever silverware.\n\nYes, City did have an excuse against Newcastle in that travel problems meant they did not leave Melbourne until 5.30am on the day of the match, ensuring a less-than-ideal preparation.\n\nBut if they fail to deliver to expectations by season's end few will be prepared to cut them any slack given the resources at their disposal.\n\nVictory should make the playoffs without any bother despite their recent slump in form.\n\nKevin Muscat's side, after winning six on the spin, has now crashed to defeat in their last three games.\n\nThey were soundly beaten in Wellington, unlucky to concede twice in the last 13 minutes in Perth when they were leading 1-0, and were stiff not to get something out of the Australia Day clash with Sydney.\n\nWhile the Sky Blues are deservedly top of the pile after their 17-game unbeaten A-League record, Muscat remains defiant and believes that Victory have the weapons to defeat Arnold's men should they clash in the finals.\n\nVictory were the better team in the first hour of the Australia Day game and could, and probably should, have been in front by that stage.\n\nBut their frailty at the back was exposed by Sydney's relentless approach, and Muscat will have to tighten things up ahead of the derby.\n\nBoth teams boast an array of attacking talent - Victory have Marco Rojas, Fahid Ben Khalfallah, Besart Berisha and James Troisi while City can call upon Cahill, Fornaroli, Nicolas Colazo and Fernando Brandan - so there should be goals in this game.\n\nWhether there will be anything as stunning as the world-class drive with which Cahill announced himself to the Australian football public in the first derby - a 4-1 win for City - remains to be seen.\n\nCity has had big problems this season breaking down teams who defend in depth against them, as Newcastle showed on Friday night.\n\nThat is one thing they won't have to worry about on Saturday as Victory will look to take the game to their cross town rivals and establish an early domination, which might leave space in transition for the likes of Fornaroli, Bruce Kamau, Colazo and Brandan.

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2620","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Queanbeyan","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Queanbeyan Age","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"351642098","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"The Queanbeyan Age","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.queanbeyanage.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196539415","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

He cannot finance the wall out of federal coffers on his own. \n \nEventually, there will be lawsuits regarding the EPA, possibly from states and cities and organizations that depend on the agency for federal assistance. \n \nAll of this has occurred even before all the dust has settled on Trump\u2019s cabinet appointments or any talk of a Supreme Court justice nomination. \n \nThe only clear result appears to be that protests from a variety of corners will be permanent for at least four years. \n \nBut the movement that put Trump in office is seeing the beginning of the fruits of its labor, unintended consequences notwithstanding.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Not many surprises in Trump\u2019s first week","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"43952","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Steubenville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169659347","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hsconnect.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196560522","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Things have improved from my earlier library generation who would sit daily and count the 3-by-5-inch cards and run them through a \u201ccounter\u201d to determine how many books were checked out the previous day. \n \nLarger libraries used a \u201cneedler\u201d which was a long steel needle that separated cards by shaking them and letting some cards fall from the rack. \n \nI guess computers have helped this process and I now have the first statistics from 2016. \n \nIn 2016, more than 100,000 eBooks, eMagazines, movies, audio books, music and TV shows were borrowed, or more correctly downloaded, from your library system. This number is increasing by about 10 percent per year, and hundreds of new library users are being added due to the online materials that can be downloaded from the library today. \n \nAt the same time, close to 750,000 books and DVDs are being checked out of the library system using our database of 92 public library systems and more than 8 million items from those Ohio libraries. \n \nEvery day laundry carts of library items requested by the public arrive and are sorted by the library staff in addition to items from our seven library locations. \n \nToday\u2019s public library cannot operate within the vacuum of the individual library building, but rather must be open to a larger system of informational sources. \n \nOur library system has been a part of the SEO Library Network since 1988, as we were one of the first four libraries to begin linking collections across Southeast Ohio to a network that now has 92 libraries. \n \nIn addition, we are now online with the Ohio Public Library Information Network linking into the worldwide network of libraries used to locate items beyond our local area network. \n \nThe old days of multiple carbon copy forms that would be mailed to the state library where someone would hunt through the card files on the 12th floor are long gone. \n \nToday\u2019s public library system is the center of the information pipeline that has developed with technology, and we hope you will join us with a library card if you haven\u2019t already. \n \n(Hall is director of the Public Library of Steubenville and Jefferson County.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Library\u2019s center of info pipeline","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"43952","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Steubenville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169659347","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hsconnect.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196561343","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It is a goal of the ICC that every Full Member plays international bilateral cricket in their own country. But for us to do that, we need everyone to be safe and secure,\" ESPNcricinfo quoted him as saying. \n\nPakistan have not hosted any international cricket tournaments since the terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore in 2009,when six Pakistani Policemen were killed and some of the visiting players were injured. \n\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was in talks with the MCC at the time for the latter to send a cricket team to Lahore, but the terror attack put an end to that. \n\n\"We don't want to get it wrong,\" Clarke said. \"We all know one terrible incident can push things backwards again. What happened here in one of Lahore's parks did make it impossible for us to send a team here last year. So we're hoping to move forward, but this isn't an easy road.\" \n\nThe ICC official further said that there's a considerable amount of perception that needs to be changed and information that needs to be shared. \n\n\"But I am most impressed by the efforts of the authorities to make Lahore a safe city,\" he asserted. \n\nThe Federation of International Cricketers Associations (FICA) has earlier this month advised players not to tour Pakistan due to an extremely elevated state of insecurity in the country. \n\nThe cricket federation, citing unnamed security consultants, had termed Pakistan as an unsafe place to play cricket. \n\nHowever, Clarke didn't comment on that statement, saying he hadn't discussed that statement with FICA, or read it in full. \n\n\"I was far more interested in coming here for myself before I opened that conversation,\" he said. \n\nThe West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) had also this month rejected the proposed tour to Pakistan after the security concerns raised by FICA.

After talking to my folks for a while, she looked at me and asked, \u201cAnd what is your name?\u201d Before my mother had a chance to tell her that I didn\u2019t talk, I looked her in the eye and replied, \u201cSunshine Jones.\u201d These are the first words I spoke.

This faith of action is short-sighted and doomed for failure. \n \nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with these children. They are advanced vibrational spiritual beings who have a bead on happiness and choose to communicate using the highest level of vibrations known to our universe. \n \nMost of the communication in our universe is through vibrations. The most powerful vibrations are the ones that are accompanied with strong physical sensations and emotions of appreciation, love, joy, happiness, excitement and enthusiasm. \n \nThe children who avoid eye contact, refuse to talk and engage in alternate behavior are the real teachers. In their own humorous way they are reminding us who we really are. They are leading by example, teaching us to use our imagination to picture places, things and experiences that make us happy and follow the trail of good feeling thoughts back to our connection with source energy. \n \nEach autistic child has a unique vibrational frequency and offers physical manifestations that serve as clues to their own thought processes. These physical signs also are offered as a bridge for family members to interact and engage the child in meaningful vibrational communication, without words. \n \nIn moments of intense love, joy, happiness and acceptance, preconceived ideas of right and wrong, appropriateness or what\u2019s acceptable behavior will fall away. Those who let go and let the children lead will be swept away in a stream of well-being and energy downstream toward every good thing life could bring. Let the children be who they want to be and, eventually, the words will come. \n \nSunshine Jones \n \nSteubenville","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Autism speaks","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"43952","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Steubenville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169659347","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hsconnect.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196561770","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2794","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Cowra","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Canowindra News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"348382822","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Canowindra News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.canowindranews.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196562110","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It had a light and everything. \n \nIt was like a cabin or a tent in a bedroom. What an amenity to a child with little to do and lots of imagination. \n \nAs the years went by, it wasn\u2019t my closet or hideaway place any more, obviously, but it was a place still used for storage \u2014 and lots of it. \n \nAnd since my return to the family homestead in Richmond, it\u2019s been on an ongoing, one-of-these-days list of things to pursue, climbing back up in there to see what\u2019s there. \n \nJanuary is that kind of month to spark that kind of interest, and as Better Half always says, \u201cEverything has to start somewhere, Janice.\u201d \n \nSo this includes cleaning the closet in my childhood bedroom. \n \nYou would think by now that I would have all my cupboards, drawers and closets in order, but not hardly. \n \nA day off midweek seemed the perfect opportunity to get going on making some sense of this particular storage area for all things that have no home elsewhere. \n \nThe trouble with some closets, though, \u2014 or maybe it\u2019s the beauty of them \u2014 is that the contents are all part of your history. \n \nEverything in there directly or indirectly has this connection to you, and connections are pretty hard to break in my book. \n \nPainful to part with, even. \n \nBetter Half and I started on the upper level of the closet where stacks and stacks and stacks of books of sheet music were piled high, orchestra scores from my grandfather Scherrer\u2019s days of playing violin in the Wheeling Symphony back in its infancy. \n \nMy mother and I probably have the same predicament, decades apart. \n \nYou can\u2019t bear to toss such things, but what do you do with them? \n \nGood question. And the first of many. \n \nSome other things we came across: \n \n≤ A bag marked \u201cWendell\u2019s wedding suit.\u201d Translated, that\u2019s my dad\u2019s wedding suit worn in 1946 when he married my mother. A dark blue suit, with white pin stripes. Now what\u2019s a daughter to do with that? A Halloween outfit? Donate it to a drama or theater group in need of costumes? \n \n≤ There was a pink and white striped Penney\u2019s box of Jackie Kennedy type hats I am assuming were my mother\u2019s. \n \nI had fun trying them on, but they\u2019re really not my kind of hat for horseback riding or social outings. \n \n≤ A giant box of tapes my mother used when she taught Spanish at Jefferson Union High School. Comprende? \n \n≤ Boxes and boxes of letters written by relatives to other relatives. Some of the handwriting is very good, but some of it is like mine \u2014 very, very bad. Either way, it\u2019s all a fascinating way to communicate, a reminder that people had to commit to paper their news, then buy a stamp to send it. \n \n≤ A mountain of miscellaneous, including a prescription box from 1938 from the Beall & Steele Drug Co., 424 Market St., Steubenville. Phone number 103. \n \nThis is a closet for long-term sorting and appreciating, a closet that now is a little more neatly arranged, but that\u2019s about it. \n \nI\u2019m just closing the door on this one until the next time I\u2019m in the mood for a little \u201ctraveling\u201d close to home. \n \n(Kiaski, a resident of Richmond, is a staff columnist and features writer for the Herald-Star and The Weirton Daily Times and community editor for the Herald-Star.

It\u2019s the annual look at the successes businesses and organizations throughout our region have enjoyed during the past year and, maybe even more important, a glimpse at what\u2019s planned for the future. The theme is \u201cPride, Purpose and Prosperity,\u201d and each story will help to show that there\u2019s a lot of activity going on across the Tri-State Area. \n \nIt\u2019s one of the most-anticipated publications we produce each year. Readers look forward to learning about what\u2019s new, and businesses are happy for the opportunity to be able to tell their stories and discuss their plans for expansion in the coming years. \n \nPride and Progress month will open with an important set of stories in our first installment, which will offer an overview of the region\u2019s economic outlook and the role the oil and gas industry is playing. The lead story will look at the cracker plants that are planned for Monaca, Pa., and southern Belmont County. Once construction at both locations really kicks in, thousands of area tradesman and women as well as many area contractors will help to build the massive facilities that will employ hundreds of area workers once production begins. \n \nArea growth will be driven by partnerships and collaboration, a point that is made by Pat Ford, executive director of the Business Development Corp. of the Northern Panhandle in Paul Giannamore\u2019s profile of the organization. Readers also will learn that our area sits in the \u201csweet spot\u201d between the two planned crackers in Giannamore\u2019s discussion with Ed Looman, Appalachian Partnership for Economic Growth project manager for Jefferson, Carroll, Holmes, Coshocton, Harrison, Guernsey and Belmont counties. \n \nThere\u2019s something special going on in Mingo Junction, staff writer Mark Law has found. Acero Junction looks to bring the former Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. facilities in the village back to life. Workers have been busy for months at the plant, and recently have run tests on the facility\u2019s rolling mill. \n \nEvan Scurti, meanwhile, is confident in the potential for growth across the area. The executive director of the Jefferson County Port Authority tells staff writer Dave Gossett that the port authority is taking a comprehensive approach to development and lays out the organization\u2019s four main priorities for this year and beyond. \n \nAnd, if you happen to drive any of the major highways in our area, you already know there\u2019s a lot of construction going on. Law will offer details about what the Ohio Department of Transportation has planned for our area. \n \nOur second installment will be published on Feb. 8 and will focus on community, retail and financial services, and you\u2019ll find stories highlighting the work being done in Hollywood City Center in Steubenville as well as a look at what the region\u2019s elected officials think the future will offer. \n \nOn Feb. 15, tourism and lifestyles will be highlighted, and will feature stories by Warren Scott on the planned expansion at Brooke Hills Park; Gossett\u2019s reporting on Steubenville\u2019s Nutcracker Village and summer concerts in Steubenville and Weirton; and Law\u2019s look at trails throughout the Tri-State Area. \n \nThe focus turns to health and education on Feb. 22, with in-depth reports on what\u2019s happening at Trinity Health System and Weirton Medical Center, the Franciscan University of Steubenville and Eastern Gateway Community College. The series will come to a conclusion on Feb. 28 with Law\u2019s look at the continued growth at the Jefferson County Airpark and Scott\u2019s report on road projects, including the new bridge that is planed to cross the Ohio River between Wellsburg and Brilliant. \n \nOf course, each of the five publications will include profiles on local businesses and the goods and services they offer to local residents. \n \nDoes our region face problems when it comes to attracting and retaining businesses? Of course it does, but there are many people who are dedicated to making existing businesses stronger and seeking new opportunities while working to make our communities stronger. \n \nWe\u2019re happy to be able to share their stories across the five installments of this year\u2019s Progress Edition. \n \n(Gallabrese, a resident of Steubenville, is executive editor of the Herald-Star and The Weirton Daily Times.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"There\u2019s progress to report","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"43952","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Steubenville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169659347","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hsconnect.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196563565","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

At least it\u2019s a good start.\u201d \n \nThis is the advice I found in a Chinese fortune cookie recently, and I try to follow it somewhat, but it was hard to do this past Monday. \n \nThe Steelers had gone down to defeat with multiple mistakes and the injury of Le\u2019veon Bell. And my \u201cRalphie onesie\u201d pajamas that I told about wearing for the past two games that brought victory did nothing to save the day. \n \nI wore them during the Miami Dolphin game, and there was a victory and also against the Kansas City Chiefs, although that one was too close for comfort. This time it didn\u2019t work. \n \nI don\u2019t know who I will be cheering for during the Super Bowl as the Green Bay Packers are gone, but I won\u2019t be wearing my flannel onesie, that\u2019s for sure. \n \n\u2014\u2013 \n \nSunday afternoon was a day of smiles, though. I was invited by Joyce Klinger to the 100th birthday of a warm and very chipper lady, Helen Bass-Smith, at the Cadiz Presbyterian Church. It was nice seeing people I have known since my days of bringing in the news while stationed at the Cadiz Bureau of the Herald-Star, starting in 1980. \n \nHelen is quick to point out that she is not a native of Cadiz because she keeps getting reminded of this by the locals. She came to Harrison County in 1935, after graduation from Toronto High School, the city where she had lived with her parents and siblings. And she did not always attend the Cadiz Presbyterian Church, where she now is noted as a loyal and active member. \n \nShe sat in the pews at the Ridge Presbyterian Church on Hanover Ridge Road near Scio for 61 years before becoming a member at the Cadiz Presbyterian Church. That seems like a long time ago, but when you have reached your 100th birthday, it doesn\u2019t seem that long. \n \nHelen was born Jan. 22, 1917, the very day 100 years later when the Cadiz church social room was filled with well-wishers who kept streaming over to wish her many more happy years. She was married to Hugh Smith, who died more than 20 years ago. There are no children. \n \nShe lives by herself and still drives her car in town and out to the Harrison Community Hospital. It was there that she volunteered her cheerful help for more than 20 years to those who were ailing and needed to see a smiling face. \n \nHer brother, Edward Bass, from Watertown, N.Y., who is a young 94-year-old, was present, along with nieces and other family members. \n \nHelen was greeted and given a framed certificate from Mayor Ken Zitko and some very encouraging words from Dale Norris, Harrison County commission president. \n \nNorris read from an outline on the gracious 100-year-old saying, \u201cShe has been a longtime dedicated ambassador for Christianity as a loyal and active member of the Presbyterian church, steadfast in her commitment to helping others and strengthening the Christian faith of her church members. And she continues to do so while celebrating her 100th birthday,\u201d Norris said. \n \n\u201cHelen has been an exceptional role model for all Harrison County residents, both young and old. She was honored by the village of Cadiz in 2007, on this same exact date, for serving as a devoted volunteer at the Harrison Community Hospital,\u201d the commissioner concluded. \n \nCommissioner Don Bethel wrote the words of appreciation for her love of others and unwavering devotion to Christianity, her Presbyterian Church and members. \n \nIt was interesting to note that her brother, Edward, was born above his parents\u2019 C.M.S. Store, a 5 & 10 cent business in Toronto. He went to Toronto High School until his freshman year and graduated from what was known as Cadiz High School in 1940. There was a brother two years older, William John, who has passed away. \n \nEd will be celebrating an anniversary himself on Feb. 2. It will be 75 years since he joined the U.S. Marines in 1942 during World War II. With a big smile, he said, \u201cYou know the saying, once a Marine, always a Marine.\u201d \n \nHis journey through the 1st Marine Division took him through Parris Island; Quanico; the West Coast; Melbourne, Australia; and ended up in Okinawa. \n \nHe plans to go with family to Hawaii in February to see the U.S. Arizona, the battleship that sank at the hands of the Japanese on Dec. 7, 1941. It was at 7:55 a.m. Hawaiian time when 350 Japanese planes bombed the U.S. Naval Base, and more than 2,000 were killed. \n \n\u201cIt has been my bucket list to see the sunken battleship for many years. Now on my 75th anniversary from enlisting I will get to fulfill it,\u201d Ed said. \n \nThe Cadiz Presbyterian Church ladies decorated a china cake cutter with flowers and Helen\u2019s name and birthdate to be used for the cutting of the three cakes to represent the number 100. She started with the number one and made a generous slice. Joyce Klinger took over after then, as Helen was surrounded with family and friends who wanted to take pictures and talk. \n \nI was surprised to see Sheila Bond, Smithfield fiscal officer, at the dinner party, but even though she works in Smithfield, she is a resident of Cadiz. She said she did not recognize me immediately either. I was out of my territory as well. \n \nThere were mylar balloons floating in the air for the celebration, and Helen, who gets around very well and moves with ease, wore the best adornment she could possibly wear, a big beautiful smile. \n \n\u2014\u2013 \n \nChar Bell Branch, a former Smithfield resident and daughter of Bob Beall, wrote to tell me that her dad died at the age of 84 on Jan. 8 in Las Vegas, where they moved in 1979. \n \nIn Smithfield, he was known as \u201cSlick 50\u201d because of his skillful moves on the football field and his jersey number of 50. \n \nAfter graduation and marriage to Grace Cooper-Beall-Webb, they moved to Steubenville, and the family joined the Mount Zion Baptist Church under the leadership of the Rev. Alfred Hunt, and he was a member of the trustee board. \n \nLamont and I met with Char, Bob and Kara \u201cCobby\u201d Bright of Smithfield for dinner when we were in Vegas in the early 1990s. Char said that her dad, who was famous for wearing distinctive cowboy hats, boots, western shirts and a big bright smile, always spoke of that meeting. He was the type who could make anyone feel like everything was going to turn out right. \n \n\u2014\u2013 \n \nI purchased more than 20 \u201cSpectator\u201d Smithfield High School newspapers that were published during the years of 1951 thorough 1959 at the Smithfield Alumni Association banquet last year at the first auction. I am finding it very interesting to read about the people I knew back then but had forgotten about and the businesses that were in the village during that time and had placed ads in the publication. Can you believe there was an advertising department at the school? \n \nI\u2019ll ask those who still live in Smithfield if they remember any of these mentioned businesses: Doris Smith Johnson Beauty Shop, Lew\u2019s Sunoco Service, Co-op Store, E.H. Welday Electric Co., Welday\u2019s Orchard, Thomasson\u2019s Hardware, Woodford\u2019s Shell Service, Buzz Park\u2019s Barber Shop, Slaga\u2019s Florist, Frances Beauty Shop, Ford\u2019s Smithfield Auto and McElroy\u2019s Drug Store. These are the ones that placed ads that week, but there are many others. \n \nI was a feature editor for the Spectator \u2014 I think Octa Foster had something to do with naming our paper \u2014 and was awarded a Quill and Scroll Award from the Herald-Star in 1954 for the best feature columns in area schools. I still have that medallion. \n \n\u2014\u2013 \n \nI would like to end this column with a poem written for the Spectator by Clara Hasley McClure, a senior at that time. There is no title but it has loads of meaning. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not the motto on your wall, \n \nThat counts in life, you know. \n \nIt is the things you say and do, \n \nIt\u2019s what your actions show. \n \nIt\u2019s not what you say you are, \n \nThat people judge you by. \n \nIt\u2019s by your attitude in life, \n \nWith what standard you comply.\u201d \n \n(McCoy, a resident of Smithfield, is food editor and a staff columnist for the Herald-Star and The Weirton Daily Times.

Salaries, rent, the cost of benefits, and other normal overhead expenses remain relatively fixed during any given year. But rather than fixating on expenses, think of these as holes in your budget bucket. Instead of obsessing on trying to keep these costs as low as possible, focus on filling the bucket. \n \nWe recently had a billing snafu with a vendor. They failed to process a payment and hit our account with $35 in penalty and interest charges. Our accounting service and two employees spent several days and endless emails and phone calls to get it resolved. \n \nI thought about how much time and effort we spent to save $35, and I realized how wasteful we had been with our time. My employees could have been scheduling client meetings for our advisors. Our accounting service could have been fine-tuning our budget for 2017 and working on the business metrics I need to evaluate our firm's profitability.This led me to wonder where else we were focusing on the wrong things. \n \nI had the opportunity to spend some time over the holidays with a business turnaround expert from Australia. He described a recent project where he took a struggling company and doubled its sales in less than a year. I asked if he had to replace most of the staff to accomplish this, and he said no, the staff was fine; they were just focused on the wrong things. \n \nNeedless to say, after my $35 fiasco, he had my full attention.  The owners realized their sales were dropping, so they went on a cost-cutting mission to maintain profitability. They suspended advertising, reduced the expense accounts of their salesforce, and cut support staff. \n \nIt sounds so foolish, but it is a natural reaction when cash flow drops to focus on cutting expenses. We all do it personally; it is how households work. But it is absolutely the wrong thing to do in a business. \n \nWhen I asked how he turned them around, he told me about \"filling the bucket.\" He restructured the compensation of the salesforce to reward the highest producers. He increased their expense accounts for meals and entertainment of clients and prospects and penalized those who did not spend their monthly amounts. He forbade them to eat lunch in the office or with each other. He brought back the support staff for the sales department and all but banished the salesforce from the office. He wanted them meeting prospects for morning coffee, talking business on the golf course, and taking good clients and referral sources to dinner. \n \nHe told me that the entire company exists to support the salesforce before, during, and after the sale. Time that a salesperson spends fixing a client issue is time not spent finding and closing another sale. Creating proposals and implementing the company's solutions are tasks that support persons should be doing--not the salesforce.  \n \nAdapting the Bucket Idea to an Advice Business \nI described our business of providing financial planning and asset management services. I explained that our salespeople, aka wealth managers, were responsible for sourcing new clients and providing the actual services of the firm. \n \nBig mistake, I was told. Those wealth managers who can source and close new business should be paired with a support advisor who gradually takes over the client relationship and provides the ongoing service. \n \nYou can imagine all the objections I gave him as to why this would never work. The clients we bring onboard want to work with the initial wealth advisor. Our support advisors aren't experienced enough or senior enough to satisfy the client.  Our real work is the ongoing advice, not just business development, etc. \n \nBaloney, I was told. Many service businesses thrive using a model of initial service by one person or team and then migration to a permanent service team. Using a good CRM system allows the initial wealth advisor to stay in the loop with key clients without having to provide the actual day-to-day service. If the support advisors aren't strong enough, train them or hire more experienced staff. If wealth advisors capable of closing business are performing any administrative or operational functions, remove those duties immediately. \n \nIn a small firm, the senior wealth advisors must wear many hats, I explained. They can't just focus on new business development. Portfolios have to be managed, financial plans have to be created, client problems have to be solved, and so on. His response was that in a small firm, there was likely just one or maybe two advisors really adept at sourcing and closing business. The challenge was not only to identify them, but instill a culture of supporting them so they could concentrate on \"filling the bucket.\" Compensation needs to be aligned with responsibility and performance. Much will be provided to these business-development leaders, but much is expected as well. \n \nHis best advice was a very clear delineation of roles within a firm, even a small one. If portfolio trading was not one of a senior advisor's roles, then they needed to keep their hands off. The people responsible for trading need the tools and the authority to make the best decisions possible.  Same goes for client service. Give them both the tools and the authority to make decisions. When problems arise, and they will, let the staff responsible develop the solutions. \n \nThis level of delegation is difficult for many small business owners, but it is the only way for those capable of filling the bucket to get out there and do it.  ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Advisors: To Grow Your Practice, Focus on 'Filling the Bucket'","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Morningstar.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658108","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"name":"Morningstar.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.morningstar.com","publisher":"Morningstar"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196572136","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nassau","zipCode":"11516","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Cedarhurst","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Five Towns Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"176334010","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Five Towns Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fivetowns.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695196572574","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A urine test on the spot revealed meth coursing through her veins. \n \n\u201cI thought I was going to be thrown in prison with all the men because I still have the title of Mr,\u201d the transgender woman said. \u201cI was afraid. News and TV tells us that being sent to prison is scary.\u201d \n \nIf we didn\u2019t separate them, people could start fighting over partners to sleep with \n \nWatcharavit Vachiralerphum, Pattaya Remand warden \n \nIt turned out not to be the ordeal she expected. The prison she was destined for \u2013 Pattaya Remand \u2013 separates lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender prisoners from other inmates, a little-known policy despite being in place nationwide since 1993, according to the Department of Corrections. Thailand, often described as a haven for gay people, has around 300,000 prisoners, of which more than 6,000 are registered as sexual minorities. \n \nAnd that\u2019s not all. The Thai government is also considering what could be the world\u2019s first prison facility exclusively for LGBT inmates. While the plans are still being discussed, in Pattaya and other prisons across Thailand LGBT prisoners are kept apart to prevent violence, officials say. \n \n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t separate them, people could start fighting over partners to sleep with,\u201d said Pattaya Remand Warden Watcharavit Vachiralerphum. \u201cIt could lead to rape, sexual assault, and the spread of disease.\u201d \n \n\n \nBy day, Pattaya LGBT inmates eat together and do their morning exercises in uniform. At night, they sleep in their own quarters, apart from the other inmates. \n \nBut most of the time, they mingle freely with the others, though they tend to stick together for daytime activities like sewing or football. Transgender women spike volleyballs next to men pressing barbells and sparing with punching bags; gay men train together in first-aid at the jail clinic, sanitising and bandaging the wounds of straight men. \n \nMany LGBT inmates agree the limited separation is a decent compromise between safety and segregation. \n \n\n \n\u201cThere are people that discriminate against gays,\u201d said Chawalit Chankiew, one of the gay clinic workers, sentenced to nine years for document forgery. \u201cIf I happen to sleep next to someone who hates gay people, I wouldn\u2019t know it unless they show it. What if they hurt me one day?\u201d \n \nTheerayut says the prison\u2019s segregation makes her one and a half year sentence more bearable. \u201cIf we behave like others, if we aren\u2019t stubborn and don\u2019t break rules, this place actually isn\u2019t so vicious,\u201d she said, sitting in a prison yard fenced with barbed wire, her long hair bobbing up and down as she spoke. \n \nBut the system isn\u2019t without problems. \n \n\n \n\u201cTransgender women who have not gone through gender reassignment surgery, they have to shave their head and live with the men, and there\u2019s going to be problems,\u201d says Wannapong Yodmuang, an LGBT advocate with the Rainbow Sky Association. \u201cSome of them are going to be OK living with the men, but there are some transgender women who might have a bad experience with men and won\u2019t want to live with them.\u201d \n \nThere are also concerns that the system does not adequately tend to the specialised health needs of transgender inmates. Hormone therapy, for example, is written off as a luxury by some. But LGBT advocates say it is essential. \n \n\n \nPlans for a separate facility for LGBT inmates on the outskirts of Bangkok could improve their treatment inside prison. The idea was first proposed as a measure to keep LGBT people safe, but it stalled over concern is that it would keep inmates far from their families. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019d be easier to control, easier to take care of, easier to develop and improve their habits and behaviour,\u201d said Watcharawit. \u201cBut they have to mix with other inmates because once they\u2019re released, they\u2019ll have to rejoin a diverse society.\u201d \n \nSome activists worry it could stigmatise them. \n \n\n \n\u201cBuilding and reallocating an entire prison facility for LGBT prisoners is as a matter of fact a measure of segregation,\u201d said Jean-Sebastian Blanc, an expert on prisons at the Switzerland-based Association for the Prevention of Torture. \u201cThere is a significant difference between a public health policy aiming at preventing transmissible diseases and segregating a segment of the population on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\u201d \n \nDeep discrimination, scorn and aggression: the reality of being transgender in \u2018liberal Thailand\u2019 \n \nSimilar proposals in Italy and Turkey have bogged down under heavy criticism. Italy announced it was rededicating a women\u2019s prison for transgender individuals in 2010, but the move was blocked by the Ministry of Justice over concerns that a special jail was a form of discrimination. Activists are attacking a proposed \u201cpink prison\u201d in Turkey over concerns that inmates there could face worse conditions than regular inmates because of anti-gay stigma. \n \n\n \nBut existing options leave much to be desired. In many prisons in the US and other countries, transgender women face a stark choice: get thrown into cells with men, or go into solitary confinement. \n \nChelsea Manning, the whistle-blower arrested for sending secret military files to WikiLeaks, was sentenced in 2013 to 35 years at a male prison in Kansas despite declaring herself a transgender woman. She was thrown in solitary confinement for attempting suicide last year, and was granted clemency by former President Barack Obama.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Top Asia-Pacific stories","group":"Top stories"},{"name":"Thailand news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Southeast Asia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"LGBT news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Crime and punishment news","group":"Society"}],"title":"World first: Thailand considers opening \u2018gay prison\u2019, already separating LGBT prisoners","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Eastern Asia","countryCode":"HK","country":"Hong Kong"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"South China Morning Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169685908","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"216"},"name":"South China Morning Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.scmp.com","publisher":"South China Morning Post Publishers"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196575350","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:22:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/140x87/public/images/methode/2017/01/29/02a16ef2-e5f0-11e6-8801-9f557f980a64_image_hires.jpg?itok=SJr5umk4"}],"video":[]}}

In Race 2 championship leader Joey Mawson extended his lead at the front with a convincing win in an action packed race. Estonian driver Ralf Aron finished in 2nd place ahead of Schumacher, who fought back from 8th on the grid.  The opening race of the MRF 1600 championship saw pole sitter Ananth Shanmugam winning ahead of Anindith Reddy and Nayan Chaterjee. \n\nSchumacher took his maiden pole in the championship after an intense battle with Newey. The 30 minute qualifying session saw Schumacher and Newey trade fastest laps before Schumacher did a 1:50.749 to seal the top spot, making it the fastest lap ever done by the F2000 at the BIC. \n\nStarting on pole, the German driver got the perfect getaway to lead into the first corner, with front-row starter Harrison Newey losing out to Felipe Drugovich going into Turn 1. Drugovich started to apply pressure on Schumacher but could never get close enough to attempt a pass. Behind him, Newey and Mawson was all over the rear of Drugovich but could not find a way past. Schumacher managed to control the pace at the front to take his third win of the season. Drugovich finished ahead of Newey and Mawson. Rinus van Kalmthout equalled his best result of the season finishing fifth, ahead of Kimi Schramm and Aron. \n\nIn Race 2, Yoshiaki Katayama started on reverse grid pole position alongside Schramm. While all drivers had a clean start there was action at the third corner with Pavan Ravishankar colliding with Drugovich and bringing out the safety car in the process. When racing resumed, Mawson pounced on Schramm at the end of the long straight and took the lead. Schramm then lost a position to Aron and two laps later Schumacher and Newey also got by. Mawson pulled away at the front and comfortably took his second win of the season with Aron and Schumacher completing the podium. Newey finished in 4th with Schramm and Van Kalmthout rounding off the top 6. \n\nMick Schumacher was thrilled to win the opening race of 2017. He commented, \u201cI am very happy with the win. I had a reasonable start and then it was important to control the pace. The circuit is very technical and very enjoyable to race on. I hope to continue this form for the rest of the weekend.\u201d \n\nIn the opening race of the MRF 1600 championship, pole sitter Shanmugam had a dreadful start and dropped back to 3rd place with Reddy storming into the lead. Shanmugam first got past Nayan Chaterjee and then overtook Reddy to take the lead. He was unchallenged after that and crossed the finish line in first place to win on debut. Reddy settled for 2nd place with Chaterjee getting a podium spot also on his debut. \n\nQualifying and Races 1&2 will take place on Saturday, January 28, with Races 3&4 taking place on Sunday, January 29. \n\nMRF Challenge 2016, Round 3, New Delhi, Race 1 \n\nDriver Name \n\nTotal Time \n\nMick Schumacher \n\nFelipe Drugovich \n\nHarrison Newey \n\nMRF Challenge 2016, Round 3, New Delhi, Race 2 \n\nDriver Name \n\nTotal Time \n\nJoey Mawson \n\nRalf Aron \n\nMick Schumacher \n\nSee more about:  mrf racing, mick schumacher \n\nThe Honda Civic is coming back, and we\u2019ve driven it this month!

are preparing for perhaps their biggest marketing and growth challenge \u2014 attracting and keeping North Carolina banking customers. \n   \nF.N.B. Corp of Pittsburgh is in the final steps of closing on its $1.4 billion deal for Yadkin Financial Corp., which was founded in Elkin and is now based in Raleigh. Yadkin is the state\u2019s seventh largest bank in terms of deposits at $5.3 billion. \n   \nMeanwhile, on Jan. 22, Pinnacle Financial Partners Inc. of Nashville, Tenn., launched its bid to gain regulatory and shareholders approval for its $1.9 billion offer for BNC Bancorp of High Point, which is 10th in N.C. deposits at nearly $4 billion. The deal is projected to close in the third quarter. \n   \nVincent Delie Jr., president and chief executive of F.N.B., said gaining Yadkin\u2019s market share and 98 branches convinced him to leapfrog over Virginia into the nation\u2019s ninth largest state. \n   \nTerry Turner, Pinnacle\u2019s president and chief executive, said taking over BNC\u2019s 75 branches in the Carolinas and Virginia positions his bank to be a strong Southeast regional bank. \n   \nIf those deals are completed, out-of-state banks would represent six of the top-10 banks in North Carolina as measured by deposits. \n   \nHowever, the reality that F.N.B. and Pinnacle face is that all of their predecessors in buying N.C.-based banks have struggled to gain or maintain market share and deposits beyond what they bought. That\u2019s based on reviewing annual North Carolina deposits data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. \n   \nOver the past 12 years, those banks include: Wells Fargo & Co. (San Francisco); SunTrust Banks Inc. (Atlanta); PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (Pittsburgh); Fifth Third Bancorp (Cincinnati); Pacific Western Bancorp (Los Angeles); Capital Bank Financial Corp. (Miami, now Charlotte); Bank of the Ozarks Inc. (Little Rock, Ark.); and First Horizon National Corp. (Memphis). \n   \nIn some instances, lost deposits and market share came from removing headquarters deposits from the bank they bought, such as Wells Fargo with Wachovia Corp., SunTrust with National Commerce Bancorp\u2019s Central Carolina Bank subsidiary, Fifth Third with First Charter Bank, and PNC Financial with RBC Bank of Raleigh. \n   \nFor example, Wells Fargo gained in late 2008 Wachovia\u2019s top deposits market share of $111 billion. Since then, Wells Fargo\u2019s N.C. deposits have ranged from $51 billion to $60 billion. Wells Fargo slipped to third behind BB&T Corp. in the 2016 FDIC data report. \n  \n Opportunity  \n  \nTony Plath, a finance professor at UNC Charlotte, said the soaring economic growth in Charlotte and the Triangle, coupled with steady growth in the Triad, is too good of an opportunity for the out-of-state banks to pass up. \n   \n\u201cWe\u2019re simply running out of banks here in North Carolina in the mad rush to consolidate these things into bigger, and not-necessarily-better, regional franchises,\u201d Plath said. \n   \nYadkin Financial, NewBridge Bancorp and BNC, found it necessary to attract private-equity ownership during the 2007-11 financial crisis. \n   \nWith that funding in hand, the banks were able to employ a growth-by-acquisition strategy over the past five years. Between the three of them, they bought a combined 19 community banks, the majority in N.C. \n   \n\u201cIt\u2019s all about putting a shine on the business to make it more marketable, and then taking advantage of the relative attractiveness of the N.C. market to sell these banks to out-of-state banks that operate in less attractive markets, such as Pennsylvania and Tennessee,\u201d Plath said. \n  \n A new trend  \n  \nThe out-of-state buying trend runs counter to what had been the pattern of N.C.-based banks being preferred acquirers in Southeast markets. \n   \nBank of America Corp. is the top bank in Florida and Maryland, and second in South Carolina, while BB&T is first in West Virginia, second in Kentucky and third in South Carolina. \n   \nOf BNC\u2019s $7.4 billion in assets, $4.7 billion were bought or acquired since 2009, including taking over five South Carolina banks and one Virginia bank. \n   \n\u201cWe\u2019re used to having a solid number of strong homegrown community, regional and national banks in North Carolina,\u201d said Peter Gwaltney, president of the N.C. Bankers Association. \u201cSo when you see this many go away in recent years, it doesn\u2019t feel good and it\u2019s not what we would prefer.\u201d \n   \nHowever, Gwaltney said it\u2019s not surprising that North Carolina would experience the loss of banking headquarters as part of the consolidation trend. \n  \n Starting anew  \n  \nBoth Gwaltney and Plath said that while they are hopeful that there are investors willing and able to begin another round of startup banks to replace those being bought, they said the cost is getting nearly prohibitive in the current regulatory environment. \n   \nThe motivation for startup banks tends to come from three sources: high-level executives at major banks wanting to run their own bank before they retire; investors hoping for a cash cow in five to seven years; and industry officials certain they can mine a particular market niche. \n   \nWhen TriStone Community Bank debuted in 2004 in Winston-Salem, it had raised $16.5 million through a public stock offering of $11 a share. \n   \nBy comparison, analysts said a startup bank now likely would be required to raise $25 million to $30 million to get state regulators\u2019 approval. \n   \n\u201cThe startup business model just isn\u2019t viable in a post-Dodd-Frank regulatory environment where banks are limited in the number of commercial real-estate loans they can make,\u201d Plath said. \n   \nStill, Plath said he could see North Carolina gaining one or two startup banks in the next year or two, more likely in Charlotte and the Triangle. \n   \n\u201cWe need stronger loan demand before we\u2019re going to see any new banks, and interest rates get back to a more normal level where banks can actually make a few bucks through lending,\u201d Plath said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Richard Craver Winston-Salem Journal"},"topics":[{"name":"Charlotte news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Banking news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Wells Fargo news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"Regulatory news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Out-of-state banks face big challenge trying to crack N.C. marketplace","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Forsyth","zipCode":"27101","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Winston Salem","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Winston-Salem Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169725249","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Winston-Salem Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.journalnow.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196579193","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(Reuters)  \nThe series against England has been a completely dominated by the home side \u2013 till now; it has been a season where first the English Test side led by Alastair Cook & co. were whitewashed 4-0 and later the ODI side led by Eoin Morgan lost a nail-biting high-scoring series 2-1. Until the Test series ended, it was quite predictable that India will win courtesy key roles played by captain Virat Kohli (leading the batting charts) and Ravichandran Ashwin (leading the bowlers pack). \n \nBut, things changed as England are now leading the T20 series. Cricket purists clearly indicated that the ODI and T20 series will be more closely fought encounters. That has been proved right, as Team India under the reign of new captain Virat Kohli is under pressure of losing a home series \u2013 the T20 series. The match to be played today things have become a bit more tougher, as Team India has a poor record at the VCA stadium in Jamtha, Nagpur; having lost both the previous encounters \u2013 to Sri Lanka by 29 runs on Dec. 9, 2009 and New Zealand by 47 runs on March 15, 2016 in the ICC World T20. \n \nIf England win today, it will be their first series win against India in India since 2012-13 season.

It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Shaw snapped a shot into the top corner of the net to open the scoring. A few minutes later, Wheat Kings goalie Jordan Thompson made a great save on a short-handed two-man breakaway to keep Brandon within one. \n\nThe Wheat Kings evened the score 1:58 into the second period when Connor Gutenberg ripped a Kale Clague pass past Tigers netminder Michael Bullion. Ty Lewis put Brandon up 2-1 later in the frame, but James Hamblin tied it 44 seconds later when he split the defenceman and scored on a breakaway. \n\nWith 27 seconds left in the frame, Jevne trailed the play and netted his first goal of the game to give Medicine Hat a lead it wouldn\u2019t relinquish. \n\nMatt Bradley of the Tigers and Tanner Kaspick of the Wheat Kings scored 14 seconds apart early in the third period before Chad Butcher skated into the zone and sniped a shot past Thompson with 3:10 remaining. Jevne added an empty-netter before Zach Russell closed out the scoring for Brandon with 52 seconds remaining. \n\nAnning felt his side had a lot of chances, but failed the pull the trigger. The Wheat Kings recorded only 22 shots on goal. \n\n\"I felt that we generated enough scoring chances, especially in the third period I thought we had some really good looks and scramble plays at the net,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t think we did a good enough job on execution to force their goaltender to make enough saves. When you don\u2019t get the puck to the net, you don\u2019t give yourself opportunities to score and you don\u2019t have those opportunities to get second chances and really get their defencemen into a scramble mode. We need to do a better job executing.\" \n\nAnning will look for a lot of improvements when his side visits the Calgary Hitmen today at 5 p.m. \n\nIt\u2019s an important game for both teams as Brandon holds the first wildcard spot in the Eastern Conference with 51 points, while Calgary is one point behind Saskatoon for the second spot with 45. \n\n\"Tomorrow\u2019s a big game for us,\" Anning said. \"It\u2019s a big game for our hockey club. It\u2019s a game with playoff implications. It\u2019s a team that\u2019s starting to score more here and is right in the mix.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders.

But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said.

Making good speeds towards the finish, with just over 3,600 miles to sail to the finish line in Les Sables d'Olonne, Colman has checked off another milestone. \n \n\"How to \u2018eat an elephant', that was the metaphor my mother used to use when I was at school and when I was intimidated about my homework. That was what she used to say, \u2018take it bite by bite' and the Vendée Globe is a big beast, and I have been breaking it up and eating it bit by bit.\" - Grinned Colman on Vendée LIVE! today belying his preferences as the race's sole vegetarian skipper. \n \n\n \n\"I have just cut my outbound track a few minutes ago. I am officially a three times round the world sailor and that is quite special.\" \n \n\"The wind has strengthened and is now above the range of the Code Zero. I am guessing here because my wind instruments have stopped working again. But I am delighted. I have made really, really good progress, especially this past night. I have knocked off Salvador, knocked off Recife. The milestones are falling. I started out this race by talking about \u2018chunking big challenges'. With the circumnavigation now complete, then there is just a Transat to go.\" \n \nColman is even more passionate now about his no-emissions technology which should see him become the first skipper to finish the race using only renewable energies. His Foresight Natural energy uses an electric motor which generates his power via a propeller. When the boat is moving the prop opens about one third and turns generating electric power which is stored in nine batteries. Colman has solar panels on his mainsail on the coach roof. He has a Watt & Sea hydro generator as back up. Fully charged he has a range of five to seven days depending on how hard the autopilot has to work. As his electric motor is also motive power for the IMOCA a data logger monitors his electronic input and output as the equivalent of an engine \u2018seal'. \n \nColman spoke to 2004-5 skipper Conrad Humphreys who was failed by his engine and generator systems during his race on Hellomoto. The Plymouth based skipper and adventurer has become a strong advocate for sustainable energies. Colman told him: \n \n\"I have a large amount of energy that is stored in the battery pack and a battery pack which is about six times the size of the other guys, and so I have an incredible autonomy. I don't need to think about charging for days on end. That was a revelation for me. To go days on end without charging takes a huge mental load off me which I did not really realize I was carrying. With a conventional system you are thinking of charging one or two times a day, thinking hour by hour when you need to charge, when to start the engine how long to charge for. And the other thing is that as long as the boat is moving I have almost unlimited power. I am energy positive. I don't need to think about it. I can create as much energy as I want. I don't need to think about rationing. Overall the system is super reliable. I have a big bronze propeller which very very strong and is situated behind the keel. It is very protected and there is only one moving part in the electric motor. There are hundreds in a diesel engine. So it is fundamentally more reliable. I have had no problems at all. I am looking forwards to getting home and sharing with the sailing community the ins and outs of the system.\" \n \nHumphreys asked about the downsides? \n \nColman replied: \n\" I can speak frankly. You do need to think a little bit tactically about when you charge. You store a lot of energy, but you need to think about getting through calms. Down by Rio I was beating my head against a wall in the calms there and so you do need to think about the good times to charge are in terms of your routing, entering into the slow parts with sufficient solar panel charging. So you do need to look at it and decide when the good times to charge are and what the balance is. \n \nI would struggle to charge only with the solar panels I have permanently installed, but I have auxiliary panels I can unroll and use. So I could also be 100 per cent reliant on solar panels if I needed to be.\u201d \n \nHe concluded: \n\"Ocean Racing, and especially solo ocean racing, is the only mechanical sport that can truly set out to claim to be clean. You will never have F1 beating its chest about its footprint on the earth. So that was my first motivation. And my second motivation is that I truly believe it is more reliable and that is a story which is borne out by your experience (to Conrad Humphries) when you had two diesel engines break down on your Vendée Globe. They can be taken out by dirty diesel, fuel filters or any number of systems that can render them useless, and so in terms of reliability - which is absolutely king in non stop racing around the world, electric generation with these kind hydrogenerators are the most sure and reliable system that exists.\" \n \nSunday at Cape Horn \n \nSébastien Destremau had 230 miles still to sail on his TechnoFirst FaceOcean to reach Cape Horn and so should be there during Sunday afternoon. After gusts to 40kts the winds should ease for him today to a more amenable 25kts for the first passage of Cape Horn for the skipper who only decided he wanted to take on the Vendée Globe on the eve of the 2012-13 race start when he was working for a TV station. In ninth place Eric Bellion \u2013 250 miles ahead of Colman- should cross the Equator this evening.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2340","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Tamworth","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Northern Daily Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169733885","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"28"},"name":"Northern Daily Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.northerndailyleader.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196597714","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2340","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Tamworth","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Northern Daily Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169733885","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"28"},"name":"Northern Daily Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.northerndailyleader.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196609284","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Letaba Rest Camp \n \nLetaba Rest Camp is situated on the bend of the Letaba River. The camp is midway between the southern and northern boundaries, reports the  Lowvelder . \n \nThe name means \u201criver of sand\u201d. The riverbed is an excellent location for game viewing, particularly elephant. \n \n\n \n2. Orpen Rest Camp \n \nOrpen Rest Camp is situated on the western border of the KNP. It derived its name from the surname of the donor of the land, Eileen Orpen. \n \nIt is an area of scattered trees and wide-open plains populated by the three big cats. You can also look forward to encounters with wild dog. \n \n3. Talamati Bushveld Camp \n \nTalamati Bushveld Camp is situated in a large open valley. Talamati is a Xitsonga word that means \u201clots of water\u201d. \n \nDespite the meaning of the name, the river is actually dry. The clay soil acts as a giant sponge holding a vast reservoir of underground water. The vegetation there is lush all year round and attracts grazers. \n \n4. Sirheni Bushveld Camp \n \nSirheni Bushveld Camp nestles on the edge of the KNP\u2019s northern plains. \n \nThe Mphongolo River flows close by. Sirheni is a Tsonga word that means \u201ccemetery\u201d. There is an elephant graveyard at a site near to the camp. From the camp\u2019s bird hides a wide variety of game and birds can be watched. \n \n\n \n5. Skukuza \n \nSkukuza is a Shangaan word meaning either \u201che who sweeps clean\u201d or \u201che who turns everything upside down\u201d. It is the biggest camp in the park. \n \nSome Krugerholics even call Skukuza the \u201ccapital\u201d of the Republic of Kruger! \n \nIt is close to the Kruger Gate and an excellent springboard to the rest of the Park. \n \n\n \n6. Punda Maria \n \nThe name of the Punda Maria rest camp was given in 1919 by the first ranger to be posted to the area, Captain JJ Coetser. \n \nHe mistakenly named his post Punda Maria in the belief that this was the Swahili name for zebra, the first big game he saw on arrival. \n \nThe correct Swahili name is actually \u201cpunda milia\u201d or striped donkey. When the error was pointed out to him, he chose to retain the name, in honour of his wife, Maria. \n \nDr. Salomon Joubert said that in 1959, the Parks Board changed the name to Punda Miliya. \n \nDr. Van Warmelo, a well-known ethnomologist, said that the name should be spelt Punda Milia and the board accepted that. \n \nIn 1981 Dr. Tol Pienaar did a submission to the board and two acquaintances of Coetzer Hewit Ivy and Astley Maberley said that this is the correct version of how it came about. \n \nThe board accepted the explanation and the name was restored in 1981. \n \n\n \n\u2013  Caxton News Service \n \nRead original story on lowvelder.co.za","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"This is how these six Kruger camps got their names","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Estcourt and Midland News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"533461454","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Estcourt and Midland News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://estcourtnews.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196622966","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n\nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n\n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n\n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n\n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n\nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n\nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n\nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n\nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n\nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n\nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n\nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n\nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \nReleased under special circumstances \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n\nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n\n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n\nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n\nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n\nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n\nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n\n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n'The executive order is unlawful' \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n\nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n\n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n\nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n\n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n\nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n\nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n\n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n\nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \nLegality questioned \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n\nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n\n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n\nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US.

(Photo: File/Standard) \nThe vast wealth of the Kenyatta family was considered such a crucial factor in Kenya\u2019s internal security that the CIA, America\u2019s spy agency, issued a special report on it the day Kenya\u2019s founding father was buried in 1978. \n \nThe report, which was made public last week, talked of thousands of acres of land owned by Mzee Kenyatta and his wife Mama Ngina, high-powered wrangles over gemstones mines, a colossal stake in the charcoal trade, secret exports of ivory and an unspoken fear that Kenyans would revolt and seize back land from the First Family. \n \nStamped \u2018secret\u2019, the Economic Intelligence Weekly Review dated  August 31, 1978 is part of nearly 800,000 declassified files that the CIA was forced to publish online just ten days ago. It gives an insight into the explosive mix of power and business in the post-independence Kenya and might explain why the Kenyatta family has always appeared to be indebted to President Daniel arap Moi, who took over on Mzee Kenyatta\u2019s death, amid a wave of resentment against the country\u2019s ruling class. \n \nThe CIA, in the report, equates the Kenyatta family to royalty and expresses fear that it might be the target of \u201cwealth redistribution\u201d following the change of government. \n \nContrary to its analysis, however, Moi not only vowed to protect Kenyatta\u2019s legacy in the Nyayo philosophy \u2014 following in Mzee\u2019s footsteps \u2014 but anointed a scion of the Kenyatta clan, now President Uhuru Kenyatta, as his successor when he stepped down in 2008 after ruling Kenya for 24 years. Uhuru\u2019s first stab at the presidency was thwarted by the candidature of Moi\u2019s former Vice-President Mwai Kibaki, who rode to victory on a national coalition and a last-minute backing of Raila Odinga. \n \nALSO READ: Mzee Kenyatta\u2019s dancers demand land settlement \n \nAccording to the CIA\u2019s assessment in 1978, the Kenyatta family was \u201cresented\u201d, perhaps because of a public perception that their wealth had been acquired through dubious means. The CIA wrongly speculated that that Moi and the then Attorney General Charles Njonjo were likely to \u201ccapitalise on the widespread dislike of Mama Ngina and on public discontent over corruption to take over large shares of the family\u2019s holdings.\u201d Such a move would lead to conflict, it warned. \u201cWhether attempted as a first step toward widespread income redistribution or merely as a shift of resources in favour of the new rulers, such a move would almost certainly provoke a strong political response from the Kenyatta family,\u201d the report says. \n Mama Ngina Kenyatta. (Photo: John Muchucha/Standard) \nThat \u201cstrong political response\u201d is undefined, but part of the 13-million page document shows America was worried that the ministers who had been loyal to Kenyatta were likely to overthrow Moi or ensure that he did not succeed Kenyatta after acting as President for 90 days as the Constitution then prescribed. \n \nThat did not happen. After being sworn in as Acting President, Moi neutralised ministers considered closest to Kenyatta, such as Paul Ngei and Mbiyu Koinange, and outmaneuvered his opponents with the support of Njonjo and the Laikipia politician G.G Kariuki, deftly establishing his own rule \n \nThe Kenyatta family was already rich, and the CIA was able to find what it describes as \u201cextensive holdings of farms, plantations, hotels, casino and insurance, shipping and real estate companies\u201d as part of the wealth portfolio. \n \nVast farms \n \nIt reported: \u201cKenyatta himself owned only about a half-dozen properties covering roughly 4,000 hectares, mainly farms in the Rift Valley and in the district of Kiambu where he was born. His wife, Mama Ngina Kenyatta, however, owns at least 115,000 hectares including a 13,000 hectare ranch in the Kiambu district, two tea plantations at Matu and Mangu, and three sisal farms near the Tanzanian border. She also has considerable holdings in the resort areas around Mombasa and is involved in coffee plantations and in the Kenyan ruby mines.\u201d \n \nThe Standard on Sunday has been unable to establish the veracity of this assertions, which were cabled to Washington by the agency\u2019s Nairobi operatives. Mama Ngina, who is distinctly private and whose public appearances are rare, and Uhuru\u2019s half-sister Margaret, now in her eighties and ailing, are depicted as very wealthy at that time. Margaret, the second African Mayor of Nairobi, was the daughter of Kenyatta\u2019s first wife Wahu. \n \nALSO READ: Jomo and Jaramogi: A tale of Kenya\u2019s enduring political dynasties \n \nOne of the CIA\u2019s memos says: \u201cMama Ngina and Margaret Kenyatta are probably the country\u2019s two largest charcoal and ivory traders \u2013 particularly lucrative businesses. Although the export of these items is banned because depletion of Kenya\u2019s forests and wildlife threaten the underpinning of the Kenyan economy, both women have been able to obtain special licenses. For instance, shortly after a ban on ivory exports (except for tusks from elephants that died of natural causes or shot for control purposes), went into effect, the United Africa Corporation, whose chairman and chief stockholder is Margaret Kenyatta received an export licence for 1,250 baby elephant tusks.\u201d \n \nThe document accuses Kenyatta and his inner circle of having skimmed off part of the money that was to be used to resettle Kenyans on land bought from white settlers. They allegedly used the cash to \u201caccumulate land\u201d. When MPs considered setting a limit on how much land a person could hold, these moves were blocked, it says \n \n\u201cAt independence in 1963, the British established a fund to help the Kenyan Government purchase farms from European settlers in this area and redistribute them among land-hungry African farmers. Although hundreds of African farmers were resettled through this scheme, some of the funds allegedly were used by family members and Kenyatta\u2019s ministers to accumulate land. To protect the holdings of its members and the family, the government blocked every parliamentary attempt to limit land ownership,\u201d reads the memo. \n \n\u201cFamily members and close associates control a large part of the land in the White Highlands, the homeland of Kenyatta\u2019s tribe, the Kikuyu.\u201d \n \nTo explain how seriously the Americans took what they viewed as public resentment of the First Family, the agency quoted parliamentary debates, newspaper reports, and intellectuals who had all expressed displeasure with the regime \u2013 just 15 years after independence. \n \n\u201cThe Kenyatta family\u2019s hold on the economy is increasingly resented. Public criticism has been fanned by open parliamentary debate about scandals and high-level corruption, which has been widely publicized by the country\u2019s free press. Students and faculty at the University of Nairobi are particularly concerned about the uneven distribution of Kenya\u2019s wealth and income. They and, increasingly, the man on the street are very critical of the family\u2019s involvement in the charcoal and ivory trade, which endangers vital national resources,\u201d the CIA said. In a 1979 diplomatic cable, seen by The Standard on Sunday, which is not part of the CIA cache, the then US ambassador Anthony Marshall said the expectations of a public raid on the Kenyatta\u2019s had been thwarted. \n \nGame over \n \nALSO READ: Why 2017 will mark end of the Kenyatta, Oginga rivalry \n \n\u201cContrary to the expectations of many, the Kenyatta family and the close associates of the former president have not been attacked by the new government on the issue of the corrupt means through which they obtained much of their wealth. On the other hand, we hear that Moi has let it be known that, while he will not stop anyone from enjoying his ill-gotten gains, the game is over for the Kenyatta clique and no more corruption will be tolerated from them,\u201d the cable reads. \n \n\u201cAt the time of the president\u2019s death, there were rampant stories that Kenyatta\u2019s wife, Mama Ngina, would seek to flee the country in order to save herself from the wrath of the new government or the populace at large.  This did not, however, happen, and Mama Ngina still enjoys a respected position in Kenyan society. She divides her time between family farm at Gatundu and a residence on the grounds of the State House, which has been set aside for her use,\u201d reads the cable, perhaps referring to the Kenyatta family home adjacent to State House, Nairobi. \n \nThe CIA files also mentioned other members of Mzee Kenyatta\u2019s family. \u201cHis son by his first wife, Peter Muigai Kenyatta, holds a seat in Parliament and is part owner of Inchcape, a trading company that handles among other things the Ford Motor Concession in Kenya. Peter Kenyatta and his sister Margaret, the former Mayor of Nairobi, also own large tracts of land. The late President\u2019s cousins include the director of Lonrho in Kenya, the chairman of the company that built the Mombasa-to-Nairobi gas pipeline and Kenya\u2019s sole film distributor,\u201d the file said. \n \nThe Americans were partly upset with Kenyatta and Mama Ngina, whom they blamed for the deportation of an American citizen, John M. Saul, a mining geologist deported shortly after discovering rich ruby deposits at the Coast. A June 19, 1975 cable by ambassador Marshall, notified the US State Department of the deportation and blamed the \u201creal reason for the expulsion\u201d on \u201cgreedy Kenyans in high places\u201d. \n \nMr Saul had surrendered a 51 per cent  of his precious discovery, to his \u201cAfrican partners\u201d \u2013 read top officials in the then Kenyatta government\u2014but the State, through the then Minister of Natural Resources, William Odongo Omamo \u2013  insisted that there was no way he was going to hold 49 per cent of the company. \n \n\u201cOmamo informed Saul that it had been \u201cdiscovered\u201d that two of four deposits to have been exploited by new corporation had been taken over by companies representing personal interests of Mama Ngina, President Kenyatta\u2019s wife, and Beth Mugo, Kenyatta\u2019s niece, on grounds that Saul\u2019s claims were not properly registered. Omamo moreover told Saul that the original group of Kenyan shareholders now dissatisfied with their shares of shrunken assets of the corporation and had demanded that Saul\u2019s share be decreased from 49 per cent to 20 per cent to give them larger proportions,\u201d reads the cable. \n \n\u2014shiunduonline@gmail.com \n \nALSO READ: Born to lead?

Bogoslof is on an island about 60 miles west of Unalaska. \n \n\"A volcanic cloud was observed in satellite data beginning at (5 a.m. Alaska time),\" AVO staff wrote. \"Subsequent images show the volcanic cloud moving towards the east. The cloud is ice-rich, but likely contains volcanic ash.\" \n \nMichelle Coombs, the observatory's scientist in charge, said volcanologists notified state officials early Tuesday but had expected only possible trace amounts of ashfall in Unalaska. \n \nBrian Hagenbuch, a general aviation meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Alaska Aviation Weather Unit in Anchorage, said that an advisory to pilots for the ash cloud was canceled at about 11:20 a.m. \n \nThe cloud passed over Unalaska between 7 a.m. and 7:30 a.m., Hagenbuch said. Its subsequent track on radar took it east over the Gulf of Alaska, where it dissipated later Tuesday morning. \n \nBogoslof has been erupting since mid-December, sending ash clouds to altitudes of up to 31,000 feet. Last week, an ash cloud from the volcano forced several aircraft to divert around it. \n \nCoombs said there wasn't any immediate prognosis for future eruptions at Bogoslof, given its unstable behavior. \n \n\"We feel like it's Groundhog Day because it keeps erupting, but previous eruptions have lasted three weeks \u2014 we're already beyond that,\" Coombs said. \"Certainly these eruptions, these explosions, could continue on, but we'll just have to see.\" \n \nAt about 9:45 a.m. Tuesday, AVO said it had been tracking an \"energetic earthquake swarm\" since Monday near another Aleutians volcano, Takawangha.

They\u2019re co-ordinating with private attorneys and firms that have volunteered to help. They\u2019re reviewing statutes, setting priorities and seeking donations. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all-out war,\u201d said Vermont Law School Professor Patrick Parenteau. \u201cIf you\u2019re an environmentalist or conservationist, this is indeed a scary time.\u201d \n \nTrump\u2019s first week in office only heightened their anxieties. He moved to resume construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines that the Obama administration had halted, while signalling intentions to abandon his predecessor\u2019s fight against global warming, vastly expand oil and gas drilling on public lands and slash the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s budget. \n \nGOP lawmakers, meanwhile, introduced measures to overturn a new Interior Department rule barring coal mining companies from damaging streams and to remove some wolves from the endangered species list. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019ve wasted no time in doing bad things,\u201d said Pat Gallagher, director of the Sierra Club\u2019s 50-member legal team, which he said is likely to grow as environmentalists increasingly regard the courts as their best option, even though success there is far from certain. \n \nThe Department of Justice, which represents the federal government in environmental lawsuits, declined to comment, while the White House did not respond to emails seeking comment. Doug Ericksen, communications director for Trump\u2019s transition team at EPA, said of the environmentalists that he\u2019s \u201cnot sure what they think they\u2019re preparing for\u201d but suspects they are stoking fear of Trump as a fundraising tool. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019re more concerned about raising money than protecting the environment,\u201d Ericksen said. \n \nJim Burling, litigation director for the Pacific Legal Foundation, a non-profit property rights group that sues regulators on behalf of businesses and landowners, also contended environmental groups were exaggerating the Trump administration\u2019s threat for political and financial gain. \n \nThe government bureaucracy is entrenched, Burling said, and, \u201cwho happens to occupy the White House hasn\u2019t made that much difference.\u201d \n \nEnvironmentalists say their fears are justified by the new administration\u2019s antagonism toward government\u2019s role in keeping air and water clean and the planet from overheating. \n \nDonations began increasing after Trump\u2019s election, \u201ceven before the fundraising letters were sent\u201d asking for support to fight the administration\u2019s actions, said David Goldston, government affairs director at the Natural Resources Defence Council. \n \nEarthjustice, which has represented the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in its fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline, has about 100 staff attorneys and plans to bring more aboard, said Tim Preso, who manages the group\u2019s Northern Rockies office. \n \nThe Chicago-based Environmental Law & Policy Center is adding four attorneys to its pre-election staff of 18 and is co-ordinating with more than a dozen outside attorneys who would file citizen suits against polluters for free if agencies fail to enforce existing rules, said Executive Director Howard Learner. \n \n\u201cWe cannot fully substitute and replace the EPA doing its job,\u201d Learner said. \u201cBut on the other hand, we\u2019re not going to default to zero if the EPA steps backward when it comes to clean air and clean water enforcement.\u201d \n \nOn inauguration eve, five law professors filed a brief in support of a 2015 regulation giving EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers discretion to regulate tributaries and wetlands far upstream from navigable lakes and rivers to protect water quality. \n \nDozens of states have sued to block the rule \u2014 including Oklahoma, led by state Attorney General Scott Pruitt, now Trump\u2019s choice for EPA administrator \u2014 saying it gives government too much power over private property. \n \nShortly after Trump took office, his White House webpage listed the rule among \u201charmful and unnecessary policies\u201d he would target. \n \n\u201cIf the Trump administration won\u2019t defend the rule, I want to stand alongside environmental groups and do what I can to defend (it),\u201d said David Uhlmann, a University of Michigan law professor and former Justice Department prosecutor, who helped file the brief. \n \nGoing to court is just one tactic environmental lawyers will use, said Erik Schlenker-Goodrich of the Oregon-based Western Environmental Law Center, which also plans new hires. They will monitor agencies for failure to enforce pollution law or cutting corners when writing permits for activities such as oil and gas drilling, he said. \n \nThe Sierra Club\u2019s Gallagher, who sued over oil drilling beneath national parks during the George W. Bush administration, said another tactic would be making liberal use of open-records laws to obtain scientific data and other materials that might otherwise be purged. The group already has requested records on climate change from the EPA. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised at what they\u2019re doing, but maybe a little surprised at how fast and furious it\u2019s all happening,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cBut we were bracing for it and we\u2019re ready.\u201d \n \n___ \n \nFlesher reported from Traverse City, Michigan. \n \n___ \n \nFollow Webber and Flesher on Twitter: https://twitter.com/twebber02, https://twitter.com/JohnFlesher","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Environment news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Environmentalists preparing to battle Trump, GOP in court","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"T1Y","state":"Alberta","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Calgary","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"680 News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667246","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"585"},"name":"680 News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.680news.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/twebber02","https://twitter.com/JohnFlesher"],"sequenceId":"695196627727","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:49:16Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A team of five instructors will attempt to cover the wide range of skills needed for a direct marketing operation, including how to write a business plan, the legal side of running a processing operation, and how to find a market for the product. \n \n\"This is really an appetizer,\" Fong said. \"We start to give you a taste of what you need to do to set your business up.\" \n \nThe class isn't just for salmon fishermen. Fong said one student who has signed up is a sea cucumber diver. \n \n\"Some of the whitefish fishermen are also interested,\" he said. \n \nFong and his colleagues have experience in the seafood industry, and will also bring in additional people from the processing industry for the last session. \n \nFong said he first helped with teaching the a direct marketing workshop in the early 2000s. After the low salmon prices of the late 1990s, fishermen asked for help looking for ways to improve their profitability, so the first workshops were developed. From 2001-2004, the material was presented in one-day workshops in various coastal communities. \n \nBut interest waned somewhat when prices improved. Now, with some tough market conditions for a variety of species and low salmon again, fishermen have been showing renewed interest, Fong said. \n \n\"Out in the bay, [you see] set-netters start small-scale processing plants,\" he said. \" ... In Kodiak, fishermen pay processors for custom processing.\" \n \nThe workshop was revived for the Young Fishermen's Summit, and now it's turning into a longer class, with five meetings in February. This time around, the course is being offered via an online interface. Spreading it out over several meetings will give students a chance to mull the ideas they are learning about, and they'll have homework \"to help them think about things,\" Fong said. \n \nThe things to think about, Fong said, are logistics and planning. The course will cover how fish actually get processed, whether via custom processing with a larger processor or a new, small facility, the product type that is produced, cold storage, and how the fish gets from the ocean to customers in a timely fashion. \n \n\"This gives them a look step-by-step at the costs a business has to incur to get to the retail step,\" Fong said. \n \nThat will also include the marketing side, such as how to do market research and find a customer base. The class will also cover the costs involved in starting a direct marketing business, and look at the time that it takes to develop that business, so that fishermen can figure out whether or not the endeavor might pencil out. \n \nAfter the course ends, Fong said the MAP agents will continue helping students who choose to pursue direct marketing with individual consultations and additional resources as necessary. \n \nThis time around, the Marine Advisory Program is shooting for 20 students. After registration was open for about a day, they had five enrolled. \n \n\"If there's a lot of demand, we would give the workshop again,\" Fong said. \n \nMolly Dischner can be reached at mdischner@reportalaska.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Marketing news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Program offers marketing class for fishermen","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Anchorage","zipCode":"99518","state":"Alaska","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Anchorage","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Arctic Sounder","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"170850788","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"8"},"name":"Arctic Sounder","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thearcticsounder.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196628177","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There are good reasons to be worried at this time and I need to stand up and voice my concerns as a citizen participating in the democratic process. It's my right but also my responsibility.\" \n \nThe marches were held the day after the inauguration of President Donald Trump. While the parent event was the Women's March on Washington, there were sister events held across the country and internationally \u2014 as far north as Arctic Slope and as far south as Antarctica. \n \nIn the U.S. alone, more than 3.3 million people marched in more than 500 cities. \n \n\"This was about people, about everybody,\" said Diana Solenberger, who attended the northernmost march with her boyfriend, John Bergman. \"If you're a white person, you have to stand up for the people who may not have their voices heard. This is not just about women. This is about men, women, the LGBTQ community, people of color. I think that was what made me happiest about the march. It was a very diverse group of people.\" \n \nJust as the people who marched came from a variety of backgrounds, the issues they were marching for ranged from the environment to women's rights to Standing Rock. \n \n\"I think a lot of people have different motivations. My mom, for example, wanted only to stay positive and show support for the greater movement,\" said Utqiagvik marcher Sara Thomas, who is Pierce's daughter. \"I wanted to show support for those now at risk of deportation, at risk of being added to a registry, at risk of losing access to basic healthcare, being more susceptible to hate crimes, but I also absolutely marched in protest of the inauguration of a man who I do not think should have ever made it to this point. Each person has their own take.\" \n \nThe national event was officially nonpartisan and was meant to reflect the diverse identities of all who participated. Solenberger and Bergman, for example, both say this march was a break from what they would typically do. \n \n\"I don't have a lot of faith in politics but [it was important] just to be a part of a group of like-minded people that share the view that we could do better for our country,\" Bergman said. \"It felt good to be part of a movement, saying we are people, we are here, we exist.\" \n \nThey don't consider themselves political, but saw this march encompassing much more than any kind of partisanship. \n \n\"By marching with your feet and showing up and standing up, you can demonstrate that there are a lot of people who are nervous,\" Solenberger added. \"I've never, ever gone to a protest before, but these are human rights issues, these are not political issues, these are people's issues.\" \n \nMany of the marchers in both Utqiaġvik and Kotzebue carried signs they had made at home the night before. Generations often walked together, with grandparents and grandchildren hand in hand. As the processions made their way down the street, drivers honked and shouted as they drove past. \n \n\"It was an incredible and very moving event to take part in,\" said Griffin Hagle, one of the handful of men who marched in Utqiaġvik. \"I was lucky enough to attend the presidential inauguration in 2009, but before yesterday, I never thought of myself as the protest type. I participated with my partner and others in the event here because I strongly believe women's problems are men's problems, especially in Alaska where the rate of rape is 250 percent the national average, and, more generally, to send a clear message that elections are never the last word in a healthy democracy. I think braving a minus 31-degree wind chill is as good a way as any to show the leaders of our government we will be watching them.\" \n \nIn what is being called a historic turnout for a national movement, people across the country bridged the vast distances between states and communities and ideologies to walk in partnership with one another for one day. In the far reaches of the Arctic, many participants said they felt more connected to the rest of the country for a day. \n \n\"It was bitter cold, but I felt warmed by the sense of solidarity and I am grateful to those who organized it,\" said local Utqiaġvik author Debby Dahl Edwardson, for whom the march was deeply rooted in current events. \"I marched because I stand for love in the face of racism, sexism and intolerance. These were among the sentiments I heard voiced repeatedly by our president-elect and I do not support them, can never support them. I am proud that as an American I still have the right to stand up and voice my dissent. I pray we do not lose this right in this oppressive political climate.\" \n \nOver in Kotzebue, local residents came out in similarly chilling temperatures to walk along the shore. For Lucy McConnell, like Edwardson, it was the current political climate that drew her and her family out to the street. \n \n\"The temperature was minus 21, or minus 51 with wind chill, and we had a good crowd show up,\" McConnell said. \"I marched because I am a woman, I have three daughters, and I believe we are strong, resilient, and deserving of respect. When I replay the statements made by our current president in my mind, I imagine them said against me, my mother, my grandmother, my aunties, my nieces, my sisters, and my beautiful daughters. I want to march because that kind of behavior and demeaning speech is unacceptable by anyone.\" \n \nRegardless of the differences of beliefs, ideas, ages, or backgrounds of those who marched in both towns on Jan. 21, one sentiment seemed to tie them together. This was something they felt they just needed to do. \n \n\"It was fantastic,\" said Solenberger. \"It was one of those things. Before, yeah it was cold, yeah it was windy, but you know, if I don't go, there will come a day when I have children and they'll ask, 'Were you part of this?' And I'll say, 'Yes, yes I was.' This is going to go down in history.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Locals march in solidarity at the top of the world","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Anchorage","zipCode":"99518","state":"Alaska","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Anchorage","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Arctic Sounder","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"170850788","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"8"},"name":"Arctic Sounder","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thearcticsounder.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196629058","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Despite being begged to do so, it also failed to send a grader to allow firefighters access to the Hamabuya farm nor to get aerial support to combat the fire. \n \nThis was despite the Letaba Fire Protection Association having a spotter plane and helicopter on standby and a Working on Fire team being on standby. \n \nMopani insisted it could not call for aerial support because it was not a member of the Fire Protection Association, but the chairperson of the Letaba Fire Protection Association, Trevor Phillips, testified the municipality had been asked in vain many times to become a member. \n \nHe said Mopani was entitled to request aerial support if it wished to do so. \n \nJudge Fourie ruled that Mopani had a legal duty to have taken positive measures by calling for aerial support before the fire became uncontrollable. \n \n\u2013 Caxton News Service \n \nRead original story on citizen.co.za","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"\u2018Negligent\u2019 Mopani municipality to pay for timber farm blaze","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Estcourt and Midland News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"533461454","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Estcourt and Midland News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://estcourtnews.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196629223","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Payton Hill poured in 15 second half points and received great support from senior Gavin Ogan who came off the bench with 9 second half markers. The two 6'5\" towers also led Unioto to a 32-15 rebounding advantage on the night.\n\nJeff Postage finished the game with 21 of Adena's 39 points. The Warriors shot 34% from the floor and committed 17 turnovers. Adena now stands 6-5 in conference play.\n\nThe Shermans shot 49 % from the floor despite going only 1 of 14 from the three point line for the game. Unioto was a blistering 13 of 15 from the foul line.\n\nHill led the way with 24 points. Ogan notched 9 off the bench while Tre Ivey put in 7 as a sub. Logan Swackhammer added 9 for the SVC Champs.\n\nUnioto has three conference games remaining with their consecutive conference winning streak now at 52 in a row.

You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\" Trump said. \n \nAlong with Syria, the ban affects travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n \nThe Department of Homeland Security said about 375 travelers had been affected by the order, 109 of whom were in transit and were denied entry to the United States. Another 173 were stopped by airlines before boarding. \n \nThe new rules blindsided people in transit and families waiting for them, and caused havoc for businesses with employees holding passports from the targeted nations and colleges with international students. \n \nPegah Rahmani, 25, waited at Washington's Dulles airport for several hours for her grandparents, both Iranian citizens with U.S. green cards. \"They weren't treating them very well,\" she said. \n \nRahmani's grandfather is 88 and legally blind. Her grandmother is 83 and recently had a stroke. They were released to loud cheers and cries. \n \n'TIP OF THE SPEAR' \n \nSeveral Democratic governors said they were examining whether they could launch legal challenges, and other groups eyed a constitutional challenge claiming religious discrimination. \n \n\"I don't think anyone is going to take this lying down,\" said Cleveland immigration lawyer David Leopold. \"This is the tip of the spear and more litigation is coming.\" \n \nThe White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Senior officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security told reporters the government would implement any appropriate orders. \n \nHowever, Mark Krikorian, the director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, called such lawsuits \"last ditch efforts\" that would only apply to a few individuals, and he said a broader constitutional argument would be hard to win. \n \n\"The first amendment doesn't apply to foreigners living abroad. The law explicitly says the president can exclude any person or class of people he wants,\" Krikorian said. \n \nSome leaders from the US technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, issued warnings to their staff and called the order immoral and un-American. \n \n\"This ban will impact many innocent people,\" said Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc UBER.UL, who said he would raise the issue at a White House meeting on Friday. \n \nArab travelers in the Middle East and North Africa said the order was humiliating and discriminatory. Iran vowed to retaliate. \n \nSudan called the action \"very unfortunate\" after Washington lifted sanctions on the country just weeks ago for cooperation on combating terrorism. A Yemeni official expressed dismay at the ban. \n \nIraq's former ambassador to the United States, Lukman Faily, told Reuters that Trump's ban was unfair to a country that itself has been a victim of terror attacks, and could backfire. \n \n\"We have a strong partnership with US, more so in the urgent fight against terrorism. This ban move will not help, and people will start questioning the bond of this partnership, Faily said. \n \nAllies in the United Kingdom, France and Germany were critical. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted a photo of himself welcoming Syrian refugees. \n \nGREEN CARD CONFUSION \n \nConfusion abounded at airports as immigration and customs officials struggled to interpret the new rules. Some legal residents with green cards who were in the air when the order was issued were detained at airports upon arrival. \n \nHowever, senior administration officials said it would have been \"reckless\" to broadcast details of the order in advance. \n \nOther officials said green card holders from the affected countries would require extra screening and would be cleared on a case-by-case basis. \n \nAirlines were blindsided and some cabin crew were barred from entering the country. \n \nTravelers were handled differently at different points of entry and immigration lawyers advised clients to change their destination to the more lenient airports, said Houston immigration lawyer Mana Yegani. \n \nAt Chicago O'Hare International Airport, brothers Bardia and Ayden Noohi waited for four hours for their father Kasra Noohi - who has an Iranian passport and a US green card - to be allowed through. \n \nThey knew Trump had pledged tougher rules but did not expect the problems. \"I didn't think he'd actually do it,\" Bardia Noohi, 32, said. \"A lot of politicians just talk.\" \n \nThousands of refugees seeking entry were thrown into limbo. Melanie Nezer of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society said she knew of roughly 2,000 who were booked to come to the United States next week. \n \nTrump's order indefinitely bans refugees from Syria. In a television interview, he said he would seek to prioritize Christian refugees fleeing the war-torn country. \n \nUS officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were not consulted on the action and in some cases only learned the details as they were made public. \n \nAt the State Department, a senior official said lawyers were working to interpret the executive order, which allows entry to people affected by the order when it is in the \"national interest.\" \n \nHowever, a federal law enforcement official said: \"It's unclear at this point what the threshold of national interest is.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Chaos, anger as Trump order halts some Muslim immigrants","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"KE","country":"Kenya"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"The Star (Kenya)","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"262196020","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"57"},"name":"The Star (Kenya)","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.the-star.co.ke"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196633109","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Juan Francisco del Canizo, a Universidad Complutense de Madrid researcher, said: \"Knowing how to mix the biological components, in what conditions to work with them so that the cells don't deteriorate and how to correctly deposit the product is critical to the system.\" \nThe process for producing these tissues can be carried out in two ways: To produce allogeneic skin from a stock of cells, done on a large scale, for industrial processes; and to create autologous skin, which is made case by case from the patient's own cells, for therapeutic use, such as in the treatment of severe burns. \n \n\"We use only human cells and components to produce skin that is bioactive and can generate its own human collagen, thereby avoiding the use of the animal collagen that is found in other methods,\" the researchers noted. \n \nThis method of bioprinting allows skin to be generated in a standardised, automated way and the process is less expensive than manual production.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Now print human skin with this 3D bioprinter","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ProKerala.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"261879685","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"ProKerala.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.prokerala.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196634516","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:27:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They plan to meet in Washington early next month. \n \nTrump spoke to Australia's Turnbull for 25 minutes and emphasized the close relationship between the two countries.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump talks to Putin, other world leaders about security threats","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"KE","country":"Kenya"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"The Star (Kenya)","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"262196020","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"57"},"name":"The Star (Kenya)","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.the-star.co.ke"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196650840","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:53:39Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There has reportedly been a flurry of activity in the past several weeks to address leaky roofs, broken equipment, peeling paint and other conditions some say make the campus appear substandard.\n\nThe complaints were aired at a town hall meeting late last year, during which faculty also complained about adequate classroom and laboratory space. Subsequent interviews with personnel revealed conditions that ranged from what some instructors called \u201cembarrassing\u201d to those that actually hinder researchers from conducting experiments.\n\nFollowing the town hall meeting, Chancellor Kim Wilcox announced personnel changes in the administration of the facilities department. In an interview in December, he said repair and renovation projects were being prioritized.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard in the last few weeks to move that along faster,\u201d Wilcox said.\n\nOne of the changes Wilcox made was to put Mike Pazzani, vice chancellor of research, in charge of overseeing the campus\u2019 facilities. Pazzani said he realizes there is a serious problem.\n\n\u201cWe all feel the urgency of this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair for faculty not to be able to do their research and for students not to have classrooms.\u201d\n\nPhysics professor Ward Beyerman said his lab struggles with keeping a suitably clean environment.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of black stuff that comes out of the ventilators,\u201d Beyerman said.\u201d Sometimes you\u2019ll come in and there\u2019s black stuff all over your desk. In any lab where they\u2019re doing optical experiments if you have dirt coming in from the ventilation system, that degrades the optics. Optics get dirty with time. Here that time period is a lot shorter than one might expect.\u201d\n\nBeyerman said his team has installed filters in the ventilation system, but they don\u2019t completely take care of the problem. And there are other issues as well.\n\nThere is water damage from leakage in the walls, he said. The lab sits partly below grade.\n\n\u201cWe have seepage in places,\u201d he said. It has damaged lab equipment, he added.\n\nPazzani said he has accelerated repair and renovation work. Over the recent holiday break, he said, about 30 faculty offices were painted and new carpeting was installed in the campus\u2019 largest lecture hall. Damaged seats in the 500-seat hall \u2013 Pazzani estimated 5 percent needed repair or replacement \u2013 were also fixed.\n\nThe campus has about $100 million in deferred maintenance, he said, noting that was not unusual for a university the size of UCR. However, he added, at the two other universities where he has worked \u2013 UC Irvine and Rutgers \u2013 \u201cthey were are little bit quicker at getting these things done.\u201d\n\nMany of the problems faculty complained about pre-date Wilcox\u2019s tenure. The degrading of some facilities, researchers said, is a long-standing issue.\n\nOne researcher, who declined to be named, said leaks in the roof of the entomology lab \u2013 also an old building \u2013 require workers there to put out buckets when it rains.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 4 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Palm Beach","zipCode":"33410","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"West Palm Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WPBF","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664683","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"130"},"name":"WPBF","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wpbf.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196669543","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

By organizing the current edition of the festival at Pune, the objective was to sensitise people from other regions to the culture of the North East as envisaged in the \u201cEk Bharat Shreshta Bharat\u201d programme of India\u2019s Prime Minister. A decision had now been taken to organize the festival in different cities every year as part of the \u201cEk Bharat Shreshta Bharat\u201d vision. Mittal was delivering his address at the inaugural ceremony of the festival at National Film Archive of India (NFAI), Pune on Saturday. The three-day festival is being held at NFAI campus, from January 28 to 30. \n\nHighlighting some of the initiatives taken by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to promote cinema in the North East, Mittal said the focus has been to provide multiple platforms through workshops, film festivals, interactive sessions and special screenings at IFFI focusing on the region. As part of the new initiative, the Ministry sponsored 10 film makers from the North East for the first time to attend the IFFI in Goa. The objective was to give an opportunity to young and emerging film makers from the region to interact with the foreign delegates attending IFFI and also explore collaborations with international film production houses, ensuring wider reach and audience for NE films. The Directorate of Film Festivals organized a special session on the North East film industry at the Indywood Film Carnival in Hyderabad. It also took the initiative to organize the first edition of the IFFI chapter of North East in Imphal in December 2016 in partnership with Manipur Film Development Corporation. \n\nRegarding the excellence of the films of the region, Mittal said that the National Film Awards and Indian Panorama over the years had been discovering and honouring the talents from the North East, especially in languages which were not specified other than the Schedule VIII of the Constitution. Some of the films had won accolades in the International Film Festivals all over the world. The Indian Panorama had eight films selected from the North East region this year. During his address, the secretary complimented the students of Pune from the North East region who had taken the pain and efforts to participate in the three-day festival by showcasing the culture and cuisine of the region. Taking into account, the enthusiastic response from the city, Mittal assured that the festival and such screenings would be organized henceforth regularly in Pune. \n\nThe opening film for this festival \u201cKothanodi\u201d by the debut director Bhaskar Hazarika has wowed the international audience with his poetic film depicting folk stories. The festival is also screening \u201cLoktak Lairambi\u201d which is part of the Indian Panomara selection. The film has already been making waves in the international film circuit after being premiered in Busan and has now been selected for forthcoming Berlin film festival.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Three day North East Film Festival, \u2018Fragrances from the North East\u2019 starts at NFAI, Pune","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Udayavani","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169732468","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Udayavani","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.udayavani.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196669708","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In a statement issued on Wednesday, Eso Oodua urges all Yoruba people to\u2026Read more\u2026 \u2013 By Muftau Ayandele \u2013 Yoruba people across the world have been urged to prepare themselves for a sovereign nation of the people of the South West. In a statement issued on Wednesday, Eso Oodua urges all Yoruba people to begin the process to actualise a new nation form the people, stretching from Lagos, through Jebba, Lokoja to Warri\u201d.\n\nThe group said that \u201cYoruba people are bitter, disenchanted, angry, hungry and desperate for a revolutionary change in a filthy land where only the cruel, the mischievous and the dishonest can easily survive.\u201d\n\nSaid the group \u201cOur position is emboldened by what is going on in Nigeria, the killings, joblessness, the massive migration of hostile and armed people into the South West, the collapse of values, the disintegration of public trust, the leadership ruin, and the floundering fortunes of the people in the hands of self-serving, greedy, malicious and self-destructive elite.\u201d\n\nA statement signed by the group\u2019s spokesperson, Dr. Akinrogun Ahmed Akindola urged Yoruba people at home and abroad to prepare for the \u201cinevitable battle of freedom leading to the official founding of Oodua Republic which begins from Lagos, through Jebba, Yagba, Lokoja, Okun and Itsekiri territories in Delta State.\u201d The statement was made available to Irohinoodua through email. The group said other parts of the country have been compelled to resort to \u201carms uprising, bombing, kidnapping and even suicide\u201d saying that what has sustained a fragile peace in Yoruba land is nothing but the civilisation of the people which he said is no longer able to stand in the face of \u201cpublic and state terror\u201d imposed on the people. \n\nDr. Akindola said, \u201cNigeria to Yoruba people means death, poverty, backwardness, retrogression and repression of our rich potentials\u201d. He said the Yoruba political class have failed to allay the fears and aspirations of the people adding that only a sovereign state of the Yoruba people will resolve the chain of hurdles that stand on the path of sustainable development in Yoruba land. \n\nHe said the lukewarm attitudes to previous elections by Yoruba people in their territories represent a vote of no confidence in the entire Nigerian political system and all that pertains to it. \u201cOur position is borne out of historical facts and the traumatic experiences of the Yoruba people since 1914 when Nigeria was created by martial fiat. Our campaign for Yoruba Nation has therefore become irreversible. It is a reflection of the reality that many of our people have given up hope on Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe group said the 50 million people Yoruba Nation is bigger than 52 countries in Europe and 82 member countries in the United Nations and it will be the third largest country in Africa after Ethiopia and Egypt apart from being the single biggest homogenous black nation in sub-Sahara Africa\u2019.\n\nHe informed that the Blueprint for the economic and social rejuvenation of Yoruba Nation has been put in place and would be put before the people and chosen credible leadership \u201cas soon as we have our own country of Oòdúà Republic\u201d.\n\nDr. Akindola elaborated that in the last ten years, the members of the group have asked and answered questions about the future politics, economy, social engineering, culture, traditions, religion, philosophy, language of the New Oòdúà Republic. We are ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is time to free the people of Yoruba land from poverty of leadership, celebration of mediocrity and excusing of criminal acts in the name of politics. Our people are tired of the miseries of Nigeria and all that pertains to it, and want to be in control of their own destiny\u201d, he explained, adding, \u201cThe road to ending violence, poverty, death, anguish and pain in our territories is to assert our rights to self determination\u201d.\n\nThe group stated \u2018Our resolve is cast in iron. We serve this notice to the world to be aware. After more than a century of traumatic experience in Nigeria, it makes a lot of sense to try something new. Our culture, language, values, economic and political potentials remain in bondage as long as we remain in Nigeria, a country that has brought Yoruba people nothing but shame and ignominy.\u201d \n\nThe group accused Yoruba politicians of being \u2018selfish, parochial, corrupt, naive and lacking integrity and completely any sense of history. They have sold the heritage of the Yoruba people. They are in power for personal gains. It is now time for the masses of the Yoruba people to fulfill the historical responsibility of pushing the \u201carijenimodarus\u201d and the \u201cJudases\u201d amongst us, off the track for the Yoruba people to be able to reclaim her lost heritage and bring back the floundering fortunes of a once glorious people and highly endowed land. \n\nThe group said it will work with similar groups in Nigeria that are prepared to take the bull by the horn and loose the \u201cfetters of iron of subjugation and misery\u201d.\n\nDr. Akindola \u201curged millions of Yoruba people at home and abroad to see this as a clarion call for freedom and the whistle for liberty out of the valley of blood and sorrow that has been the lot of Nigeria. \n\n\u201cWe want to advise our fellow Yoruba people living outside of Yoruba land to consider returning to motherland, as we will not be able to guarantee their safety should the enslaving maggots at \u2026","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Nigeria: Yoruba urged to prepare for own sovereign nation","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"MyInforms","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552614979","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"MyInforms","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://myinforms.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://africanheraldexpress.com/blog8/2017/01/29/nigeria-yoruba-urged-to-prepare-for-own-sovereign-nation/"],"sequenceId":"695196672819","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://i1.myinforms.com/300x200/default.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Some said they had been humiliated.\n\nIran, one of the seven countries, said it would stop U.S. citizens entering the country in retaliation to Washington's visa ban, calling it an \"open affront against the Muslim world and the Iranian nation\".\n\n\"It's not right to portray huge groups of Arabs and Muslims as possible terrorists,\" Najeeb Haidari, a Yemeni-American security manager in Yemen, said a day after Trump put a four-month hold on refugee arrivals and temporarily barred travellers from war-torn Syria and six other mainly Muslim nations.\n\n\"This is a stupid, terrible decision which will hurt the American people more than us or anybody else, because it shows that this president can't manage people, politics or global relationships,\" Haidari added.\n\nSudan called the decision to ban entry of its citizens very unfortunate in light of \"historic steps\" just weeks earlier to lift U.S. sanctions for cooperation on combating terrorism.\n\nIn the most sweeping use of his presidential powers since taking office a week ago, Trump signed an executive order on Friday to pause the entry of travellers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for at least 90 days.\n\nHe said separately he wanted the United States to give priority to Syrian Christians fleeing the war there. The travel curbs began immediately, causing confusion for would-be travellers with passports from the seven countries.\n\nUNFAIR DECISION\n\nSources at Cairo airport said the five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni, arriving in transit to Cairo airport, were stopped and re-directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas.\n\nA Syrian family holding U.S. visas who had travelled overnight from Beirut to Paris was prevented from boarding a connecting flight onto Atlanta, Lebanese airport sources said. They flew back to Beirut later on Saturday.\n\nIn Doha, Qatar Airways advised passengers bound for the United States from the seven newly banned countries that they needed to have either a U.S. green card or a diplomatic visa.\n\nFarea al-Muslimi, a U.S.-educated Yemeni political commentator with the Sana'a Center for Strategic Studies said, \"It's insane - but what part of Trump is sane?\"ers.\"\n\n\"This punishes thousands of innocent people for things they have no control over, when the last few attacks in America had to do with radicalized U.S. citizens, not foreigners.\"\n\nA 34-year-old Sudanese man who won the U.S. Green Card lottery said he was worried he would be forbidden entry. \"If I\u2019m barred...this will destroy my life because I resigned from my work in Sudan and was preparing to settle in America,\" he said.\n\nFariba, an Iranian-American who declined to give her family name and lives in New Jersey, said her parents would not be able to make a planned visit to celebrate Iranian New Year in March.\n\n\"What have we done to deserve such a ban? ... This ban will ruin our lives. Thank you Mr. President. Are you making America great by hurting innocent people?\"\n\nSome people planning U.S. travel said the curbs would harm their careers. Others feared for the safety of their families.\n\n\"HUMILIATING INSULT\"\n\nIn Baghdad, Bayan Adil, a doctor working in the Iraqi Health Ministry who applied for a U.S. visa to attend a medical seminar, said Iraqi academics should visit Europe instead of the United States, where they were no longer welcome.\n\n\"Trump's decision is unfortunately a humiliating insult not only for us as academics but for all Iraqis,\" she said.\n\nHer comments were echoed by Abd Al-Jafar, a 43-year-old university professor in Sudan's capital Khartoum, who said he had sought to go to the United States for doctoral studies.\n\n\"This decision, if implemented, will be a disaster,\" he said. \"I have work in Sudan and have no desire to emigrate to the U.S., just to study there. This decision is illogical.\"\n\nIn Beirut, Joumana Ghazi Chehade, 34, a refugee from Yarmouk in Syria living in the Lebanese capital's Burj al-Barajneh camp, said the decision would \"destroy a lot of people\".\n\n\"Of course we're not going to go blow anything up ...

However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council. \n \nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet. \n \nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney. \n \nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families. \n \nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\". \n \nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections. \n \nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies. \n \nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\". \n \nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts. \n \nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state. \n \nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs. \n \nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean. \n \nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts. \n \nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council.

She owns a comparatively humble semi at Northbridge, in her Willoughby electorate. Photo: Daniel Munoz \n    exit   \nSydney's booming spring property market has delivered the new Berejiklian government a budget windfall. \n \nThe amount of residential stamp duty flowing into the state coffers hit new monthly records in November and December, Office of State Revenue figures show. \n \nThe NSW government collected $730 million from the residential property transfers last month alone \u2013 about $100 million more than the previous December. November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier. \n \nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts. \n \nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July. \n \nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier. \n \nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016. \n \nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256. \n \nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years. \n \nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability. \n \nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\". \n \nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\". \n \nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year. \n \nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets. \n \nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16. \n \nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year. \n \nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion. \n \nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2153","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Bella Vista","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Hills News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169714159","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Hills News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hillsnews.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196683676","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Meanwhile Nadal is bidding to become the first man since 1968 to win each of the four major titles twice. But then Nadal began to dominate with his crushing forehand, and Federer  started to struggle. He clinched the match soon after in the tiebreak, winning his 14th consecutive final. \n \nBut Federer is in the midst of a stunning resurgence and Nadal has slowed down a bit, so who will win this latest chapter in their historic rivalry? \n \nAnd Dimitrov, serving from behind in the fourth set, kept his composure into that stanza's tiebreak and was able to stay focused and play tactically ideal in the breaker to push the match into a deciding set. Playing two of the best back-to-back points he has likely ever contested, Nadal hit a stunning backhand up the line for a victor and then followed that up with a race to the net to put away a deft volley. \n \nThe Australian Open may be the Grand Slam that American tennis audiences pay the least attention to, but this year something very special is going on down under. \n \nFederer , attempting to secure his 18th Grand Slam title, has not beaten 14-time major victor Nadal in the final of a Slam since Wimbledon in 2007. \n \nRafa Nadal returns a shot during his match against Milos Raonic at Melbourne Park, yesterday. \n \nThe Swiss took the fight to the Spaniard early, earning 10 break point chances over three consecutive Nadal service games. \n \nFor Nadal, it's his second five set win of the tournament (the first over top teenager Alexander \"Sascha\" Zverev in the third round) after losing five-setters in his last three hardcourt majors. Making matters worse, Federer was also replaced by Nadal at the top of the rankings a month later then suffered a back injury after winning the US Open. They have only met once previously in an Australian Open final, albeit back in 2009, and Federer won in five sets. \n \nAt Wimbledon one more , despite dropping the first set, it was little sister Serena's title for the taking for the second year in a row, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2. \n \nA nervous Raonic, watching his serving rockets being fired back at him, appeared rattled by the tactic early in the match . \n \nWawrinka said he had no concerns about Federer's timeout, adding that he didn't think it had any bearing on the outcome of the match . \"That's one of the things that he improved a lot\". \"No one has ever beaten me as much as Venus has\". In Grand Slam matches , he's 9-2 against Federer , including 3-0 at the Australian Open. He won the third set. Few could have imagined on that day that fans would have to wait this long for a major-final rematch on something other than Nadal's dominant surface of clay (a surface on which Nadal has probably been better than anyone else has ever been on any surface). \n \nFederer will be looking to extend his record haul of Grand Slam titles by claiming an 18th on Sunday, while Nadal can move ahead of Pete Sampras and take over second place outright in the history books if he claims a 15th major title. \n \nFederer looked like he would wrap up the match in straight sets and march into his 28th grand slam final - including six in Melbourne - when he was up by two sets and with Wawrinka walking off the court nearly in tears to have his knee strapped. Since that French Open final, they clashed in two Aussie Open semi-finals matches in 2012 and 2014, both of which were won by Nadal. \n \nAfter the fourth set, Federer took a cue from his countryman and did something odd for a guy who notoriously speeds matches along: He took a medical timeout to treat an adductor muscle injury in his leg.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Susanna Cadau"},"topics":[],"title":"Serena Williams wins record 23rd major with win over Venus","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe","countryCode":"IT","country":"Italy"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Solonews.net","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"570925548","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Solonews.net","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://solonews.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196683987","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

This may be the old line about how if you didn't know how old you were, how old would you think you were? \n \nVenus Williams, 36, and her sister Serena, 35, will fight it out for the women's title on Saturday, in an exact replica of the finals bill at Wimbledon nine years ago. \n \nIt's hard to regard him and Nadal as underdogs, given all they've achieved in the game, but that's what they are now. But here is Federer with his own chance at 18, continuing a career of awesome grace, once again playing as handsome a game of tennis as any man or woman has ever played. \n \nAfter the fourth set, Federer took a cue from his countryman and did something odd for a guy who notoriously speeds matches along: He took a medical timeout to treat an adductor muscle injury in his leg. Tape around the knee. Back he comes, on the court and into the match . But the facilities are one thing, quality is another. the work must be better and more efficient. Federer, for his part, turned a little more tentative, only making six net approaches in the third set and five in the fourth . \n \n\"I just think he's an incredible tennis player\", Federer said. \n \nWhoever wins, the match is sure to be memorable. \n \n\"We have not been there in that situation for a while, so that makes the match different\". \n \n\"Jimmy has what we all want. But I understand the magnitude of the match against Nadal, no doubt about it\". While Serena has won five Grand Slams in the past four years, her older sibling, with whom she shares a home in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, last advanced to a final in 2009, when she was 29. Nadal his 15th. Federer already has the mark for the most in history. \n \nNadal could not convert his first two match points, having no answer to Dimitrov forehands, but it was third time lucky for the Spaniard, an errant backhand from his opponent ending a match that ebbed and flowed in all the right places. [It] is exciting for me and for both of us that we [are] still there and we [are] still fighting for important events. \n \n\"I worked a lot during this month and a half at home and I never ever dreamed to be back in a final of the Australian Open, in the second tournament of the year after a lot of months without competing, but here I am and I feel lucky and very happy\". They have 29 majors between them. In short, Federer has handled Nadal's serve far poorer than he used to in his pomp. As John McEnroe once said, you can not be serious. \n \nGanguly, however, remained confident about Federer's chances of lifting his fifth Australian Open title, while adding that age was just a number. \n \nThe \"big four\" had quickly become the \"big two\", as Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic separated themselves from the pack.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Susanna Cadau"},"topics":[],"title":"Two legends reunited for Australian final battle","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe","countryCode":"IT","country":"Italy"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Solonews.net","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"570925548","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Solonews.net","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://solonews.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196687098","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A partly offsetting rating factor is the group's high investment concentration in Qatari real estate and equity assets. A.M. Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of A- (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of \"a-\" of Qatar General Insurance & Reinsurance Company PJSC (QGIR), the operating holding company of the QGIR group. The outlook of these Credit Ratings is stable. A.M. Best expects QGIR's prospective risk-adjusted capitalisation to remain at a strong level, supported by its large capital base, low net underwriting leverage and the good credit quality of its reinsurance panel. However, the group's balance sheet remains heavily concentrated to real estate assets, which accounted for approximately 75 per cent of total investments as at Sept. 30, 2016. Although QGIR's investment policy exposes the group's risk-adjusted capitalisation to significant volatility, its large capital buffers provide some cushion against potential investment losses. To date, QGIR has demonstrated its ability to prudently manage its investment exposures. QGIR's enterprise risk management practises continue to evolve in line with its risk profile. The group has strengthened its capital management capabilities by developing an internal capital model that incorporates sensitivity and scenario analysis, in order to protect its balance sheet. This has enabled the company to manage prudently its underwriting and investment exposures in recent years, and enhanced its ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to support its insurance operation. The group's operating performance is solid, with the bulk of profits generated from its investment activities, particularly from the substantial unrealised gains arising from the real estate portfolio. While unrealised gains are likely to reduce in the next few years, earnings are expected to remain dependent on investment income. Management actions taken to restore the technical results of QGIR and its Shari'ah-compliant subsidiary, General Takaful Company W.L.L. (General Takaful), have started to materialise, as demonstrated by improvement in the positive underwriting results during 2016. A.M. Best anticipates that General Takaful will maintain its underwriting discipline as it expands. With gross written premium of QR 513 million ($141 million) as at Sept. 30, 2016, QGIR has a good business profile domestically as a leading Qatari insurer. The company has maintained its domestic market position and achieved growth in recent years by focusing on developing its personal lines book of business. QGIR's profile is enhanced by General Takaful, which generated QR 231 million ($ 63 million) of gross contributions (not consolidated within QGIR's premium) in 2015. (c) 2017 2016 CPI Financial.

They want us to pay the extra money when there is not the extra lanes,\" he said.\n\nTransurban and the Andrews government have said freight operators will benefit from the widened tollway, because it will provide quicker and more reliable travel times.\n\nThey have also forecast a reduction in truck traffic on suburban streets due to a 30 per cent increase in capacity.\n\nOnce complete, the project will deliver \"a reduction in commercial vehicles using local roads, as 3000 more commercial vehicles will be able to access the freeway,\" a briefing document for freight operators says.\n\nIt also argued the increase was fair given the damage heavy vehicles do to road surfaces.\n\n\"Trucks cause a significantly greater amount of wear and tear on the freeway network and this is reflected in the truck tolling fee structure,\" the document said.\n\nAbout 26,000 commercial vehicles use CityLink each day. Extra lanes are being added to the Bolte Bridge as part of the CityLink/Tulla widening project. Photo: Justin McManus. Martin Wurt is spokesman for the Maribyrnong Truck Action Group, which has lobbied to reduce truck traffic in Melbourne's inner west.\n\nHe said higher tolls would inevitably cause an increase in suburban truck traffic without truck bans on residential streets.\n\n\"Without truck bans, operators are going to avoid tolls where they can, particularly the smaller owner-operators who don't receive a lot of money for doing the empty container runs,\" Mr Wurt said.\n\nA spokesman for Luke Donnellan, Victoria's roads minister, said the industry had been given two years' warning about the toll increase.\n\n\"Trucking rates are being brought into line with other states and territories \u2013 VicRoads and Transurban have been working with the freight industry over the last two years to ensure they had time to adjust.\" The story first appeared on The Age.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Adam Carey"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Big rise in CityLink truck tolls tipped to push heavy vehicles onto local roads","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"3400","state":"Victoria","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Horsham","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wimmera Mail Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"268400591","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"13"},"name":"Wimmera Mail Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mailtimes.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196703573","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:49:22Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/cd477594-a07c-49d4-897b-4dde7e9af0aa.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

A major generator of Victoria's coal-fired electricity is set to be expanded, sparking protests from environment groups over the effect on carbon emissions.\n\nThe planned upgrade of the Loy Yang B power station in the Latrobe Valley comes as its majority owner, Engie, prepares to shut down the Hazelwood plant and coal mine in March.\n\nThe Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has granted \"works approval\" to upgrade turbines at the plant, which will result in the burning of an extra 400,000 tonnes of coal each year.\n\nLoy Yang B provides about 17 per cent of Victoria's energy needs.\n\nThe EPA insists it has imposed strict conditions on the power generator, so there will be no additional detrimental impact on the environment.\n\nEPA development assessments manager Tim Faragher said the decision allowed higher-efficiency turbine blades to be fitted to the power-generating units.\n\nHe said the new turbines would improve power generation capacity 8.6 per cent but decrease the intensity of emissions by 5 per cent.\n\n\"The upgrade will make Loy Yang B the least greenhouse-intensive brown coal-fired power generator in Victoria,\" Mr Faragher said.\n\nHe said at least 114 megawatts of coal-fired electricity generation capacity had to be retired before the upgrade could proceed. However, the closure of Hazelwood would satisfy that reduction.\n\nHazelwood produced about 13 per cent of Victoria's emissions and up to a quarter of its electricity.\n\nEnvironment Victoria chief executive Mark Wakeham said the EPA's decision was \"extremely disappointing\".\n\nThe plant's expansion would make it harder for the state government to reach its target of zero emissions by 2050, he said.\n\n\"If Victoria is to keep its commitments to contribute to global efforts to stay below two degrees of warming, brown coal-power stations need to be phased out urgently,\" Mr Wakeham said.\n\nThe EPA confirmed that burning the additional coal would result in a 4 per cent increase in carbon emissions at Loy Yang B.\n\nBut Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio said the decision meant lower emissions for Victoria.\n\nLatrobe Valley community group Voices of the Valley has also raised concerns about the expansion. The group's president, Wendy Farmer, said the power station's pollution allowance was too high.\n\nEngie welcomed the move, saying the upgrade would improve the station's efficiency and \"increase operating flexibility\".\n\nThe upgrade will occur in 2019 and 2020 during \"planned major outages\". In a community update issued before the approval, Engie described Loy Yang B as one of the most efficient power stations in the Latrobe Valley.\n\n\"The new turbine design for the retrofit of the existing turbines will result in further improvement,\" it said.\n\nLoy Yang B employs about 150 full-time staff. It is supplied with coal by a neighbouring mine.\n\nFriends of the Earth criticised the expansion, saying it would prolong coal generation when urgent action was required to tackle climate change.\n\n\"It's time to bring the EPA into the 21st century so it can play a key role in tackling climate change,\" the group said.\n\nIt has previously been reported that Engie hopes to sell Loy Yang B.

They're mentally tough as well. They always kept going. \n \n\"It's something that I learned from them a lot, is how to hopefully do the same, which hopefully I've been able to do.\" \n \nWilliams had been reluctant to talk about records in Melbourne to keep the pressure off, but she is now ready to acknowledge her standing as one of the greatest women players of all time, if not the greatest. \n \n\"I definitely think so. I mean, between Martina, myself, Steffi Graf, hands down we are leading that conversation,\" she said. \n \nHer achievement took 19 long years from her Grand Slam debut as a 17-year-old in Melbourne in 1998, and she is not ready to stop just yet. \n \nBut she insists there are no new goals, despite Court's 24 titles being within reach. \n \n\"I never had a number. That's the beauty of it,\" she said. \n \n\"When I started this journey, I just wanted to win a Grand Slam. Then I just wanted to win. Every time I step on the court, I want to win.\" \n \nAnd in an ominous sign that there is still more to come, she added: \"I don't want it to stop. I want to keep it going.\" \n \n- Enjoy the moment - \n \nBeing at the top for so long means Williams now carefully selects her tournaments, and she is set to take a break now until Indian Wells in early March. \n \nShe said she wanted to enjoy winning in Australia, and give it time to sink in. \n \n\"One thing I learned in the past is you have to enjoy it. That's the beauty of winning Australia, you have a few months to relax,\" she said. \n \n\"If you win the French, it's like back-to-back-to-back-to-back. Australia, you have time to enjoy the moment before the next Grand Slam.\" \n \nWilliams also has wedding plans to make after her recent engagement to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who was courtside for her historic victory. \n \nShe revealed that elder sister Venus would be a bridesmaid, but not when the marriage would take place nor where. \n \nBut she said it was special having Ohanian by her side in Melbourne. \n \n\"He's been so supportive in the stands.

These topics have been at the centre of recent debates about how digital innovation changes financial fields,\" said HE Obaid Humaid Al Tayer, Minister of State for Financial Affairs. \"This seminar will discuss both the challenges and opportunities derived from Fintech services, and the importance for regulatory authorities to keep up with the technological changes. It is also important to find balance between risk treatment and the misuse of technology to avoid over regulation which may limit innovation.\" The seminar will commence with a speech by Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of IMF, with HE Pierre Gramegna, Minister of Finance in Luxembourg and HE Obaid Humaid Al Tayer, Minister of State for Financial Affairs as the key note speakers. The seminar will be held in the presence of HRH Prince Guillaume, Crown Prince of Luxembourg; HE Younis Haji Al Khoori, Undersecretary of MoF; HE Khalid Ali Al Bustani, Assistant Undersecretary for International Financial Relations and a number of international experts in government financial fields. \n \nThe seminar will include a range of activities including a discussion panel moderated by Ross Leckow, Deputy General Counsel IMF and as key note speaker Pierre Gramegna, Minister of Finance, Luxembourg, and as panel speakers Howard Lee, Senior Executive Director HKMA; Jill Carlson, Partner Lead, Chain; and Patrick Murck, the Berkman centre at Harvard. The panel discussion will be followed by a Q&A session which will allow participants to raise questions and inquiries about Fintech. \n \nThe Ministry of Finance has proposed to have open sessions on the sidelines of World Government Summit to stress the importance of the Fintech services in government financial work, and highlight the Ministry's role in leading change and achieving the future agenda. The Ministry has previously organised two workshops on Fintech in collaboration with the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF), which covered the modern technologies applied to financial services, its impact on the banking sector, and the challenges face by Arab regulatory authorities to establish a suitable environment to adopt these new technologies. Theses workshops also discussed the mechanisms for managing crises in the financial services sector, as well as the impact of Fintech services in managing and erasing risks. \n \n(c) 2017 2016 CPI Financial.

I\u2019ll do anything to help the team win,\u201d said Bethea, who made 4 of 6 3-point attempts to go with five rebounds in 25 minutes. \n \nCorey Silverstrom also had 14 points for Chico State (18-3, 11-2 CCAA) while Robert Duncan had 11 points and four assists. Jalen McFerren totaled nine points, four assists, and he grabbed nine rebounds for the second straight night. Justin Briggs\u2019 10 points and nine rebounds, along with Bethea\u2019s total, helped the bench outscore UC San Diego\u2019s reserves 24-12. \n \nThe Tritons (15-5, 10-3 CCAA) were led by Adam Klie\u2019s 24 points, Christian Oshita had 16 points and seven rebounds as the two combined to go 15 of 29 from the field. The rest of UC San Diego was 8 of 27. \n \nBethea hit a 3 to get the deficit to single digits at 50-41. Soon after, an 18-4 stretch for the Wildcats that included a 9-0 run turned the game around. Another Bethea 3 had the Wildcats within 52-46. \n \nA dunk by Briggs tied the game at 54 with 7:18 left before another Bethea 3 gave Chico State a 57-56 lead and had the Acker faithful roaring with 6:46 left. \n \nIsaiah Ellis then somehow grabbed an offensive rebound and got the layup to go down as he did, too, for a 61-60 Chico State advantage with 2:26 left. \n \n \n\u201cHonestly, Isaiah Ellis is a huge key to us winning this game,\u201d Bethea said. \u201cI love that dude.\u201d \n \nDuncan found Ellis as he hit a jumper in the paint as part of his nine points and a 65-62 lead with 34 seconds in the game. \n \nKlie answered with a jumper to get UC San Diego within 65-64, but with 26 seconds left the Tritons had to foul. McFerren made both free throws. \n \nA tying 3 from Klie was off the mark with 4 seconds left, and McFerren got the rebound and made two more free throws to end it. \n \nThe Tritons made their first four 3-point attempts but ended up 5 of 16 from outside on the night including missing all eight in the second half, a stunning turnaround after leading the hosts 42-29 at the break. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t have to say much at halftime,\u201d Chico State head coach Greg Clink said. \u201cThey knew.\u201d \n \nUC San Diego led 22-9 after its fourth 3 with 10:49 in the first half. \n \nA 9-0 Chico State run cut the San Diego lead to 28-22 with Duncan providing six of the points and Bethea providing plays. His steal and assist to Duncan for a layup capped the spurt after he scored with an offensive rebound and layup. \n \nMichel Shoemaker, a Corning High graduate and former Butte College standout, played 11 minutes and scored four points for the Tritons as a large contingent of Corning fans cheered him on. \n Women  \nUC San Diego 68, Chico State 48 >> The Wildcats took a 40-39 lead in the third quarter, but the first-place Tritons responded with a 9-0 run to end the period and kept going in the fourth quarter on Marcella Hughes\u2019 3-pointer as the first of two 12-0 runs that paved the way to their 12th straight victory. \n \nExcept for Whitney Branham\u2019s third 3 of the night that had Chico State within 51-43, the Tritons led by double digits the rest of the way. \n \nThe Wildcats missed 11 of 12 shots at one point in the quarter as UC San Diego (16-3, 12-1 CCAA) pulled ahead by as much as 20 multiple times. \n \nBranham led Chico State (12-7, 7-6 CCAA) with 13 points.

Trump and his team insisted the order was not intended to target Islam and its followers, but the hashtag #muslimban trended, and many Muslims both in America and abroad said they viewed the measure as a broadly conceived and stinging exclusion. \n\nCapping a day of high-stakes drama, a federal judge in New York, Ann M. Donnelly, ordered a halt to deportations of travelers who arrived at airports with valid visas to enter the U.S., saying that sending them back to the affected countries could cause them \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d But she did not rule on the legality of the executive order, nor did she say that others who have not yet arrived in the U.S. can be allowed to proceed. \n\nOpponents of the president\u2019s directive vowed to seek a wider court win. Lawyers from groups including the American Civil Liberties Union said they intended to press ahead with efforts to overturn the president\u2019s overall order on constitutional grounds. And they rejoiced at their early victory. \n\n\u201cClearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country,\u201d said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero. \u201cOn week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n\nIn a separate and more limited ruling, a federal judge in Virginia ordered a weeklong stay against removing people with permanent U.S. residency who had been detained under the presidential order at Washington Dulles International Airport. \n\nAs the directive\u2019s effects spread, thousands staged spontaneous protests against refugee detention at airports across the country, including in Los Angeles and San Francisco. At New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, demonstrators waved signs and read from the famous Emma Lazarus poem inscribed in the Statue of Liberty. \n\nAt more than a dozen airports, including Los Angeles, Newark, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and Atlanta, immigration attorneys stepped up in droves to offer free services to those detained. \u201cA lot of tears and emotion here,\u201d said Hassan Ahmad, a lawyer from northern Virginia who hustled to Dulles airport. \n\nThe New York order appeared to affect the 100 to 200 people who were detained in transit to the United States. While the order will prevent them from being sent home, it was less clear whether they will have to remain in detention while their asylum cases are being decided. \n\nOne of the two detained Iraqis named in the case, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was an interpreter who had worked on behalf of the U.S. government. Freed after 19 hours in custody, he wept as he spoke to reporters, thanking supporters and calling America \u201cthe land of freedom, the land of rights.\u201d \n\nThe groups bringing the legal challenge, who also included the International Refugee Assistance Project and the National Immigration Law Center, said a separate motion sets the stage for a larger action involving other would-be refugees, visitors and immigrants stopped at other ports of entry. \n\nArab American advocacy groups also were reacting to the new order, warning that it was disrupting travel all over the world. \n\n\u201cWe see complete chaos in the way this has been implemented,\u201d Abed A. Ayoub, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said in a conference call with reporters. \n\nThe directive, he said, had caught up not only desperate refugees who had thought themselves within a hairsbreadth of safety, but many more with already established lives, homes and families in the United States. \u201cThis order needs to be rescinded,\u201d he said. \n\nIn another legal challenge, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would file a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. The suit, to be filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Virginia, argues that the executive order is unconstitutional because of its apparent aim of singling out Muslims. \n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that refugees \u2014 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2014 are a threat to national security,\u201d the group\u2019s national litigation director, Lena F. Masri, said in a statement. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d \n\nThe order, signed Friday by Trump during a visit to the Pentagon, suspends all refugee entries for 120 days. In addition, it indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees and bars entry to the U.S. for 90 days for those traveling from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n\nProminent Muslim figures raised their voices in opposition to the temporary refugee ban, saying children would be among those suffering the most from it. \n\nNobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by the Taliban, said in a statement that she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d that Trump was closing the door on \u201cchildren, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war.\u201d \n\nOn Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said the travel ban also covered holders of green cards, who are authorized to live and work in the U.S. Some reports have put the number of such permanent residents from the affected countries as high as half a million. \n\nAn administration official said that current green card holders from the affected countries would be allowed to remain in the U.S. \u2014 but that those caught outside the country at the time of the ban\u2019s imposition would have to be allowed back in on a case-by-case basis. Those with business overseas will have to meet beforehand with a consular official. \n\nThe measure\u2019s scope was also widened by a State Department announcement that dual nationals from the seven affected countries who also held passports from third countries such as Britain or Canada could be blocked \u2014 in effect denying U.S. entry to citizens of closely allied nations.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Laura King"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Trump's ban on some U.S. entries sparks confusion and protest worldwide, and legal rebukes at home","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Maricopa","zipCode":"85301","state":"Arizona","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Glendale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Glendale News Press","feed":{"genre":"Obituaries","tags":[],"id":"169773059","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Glendale News Press","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.glendalenewspress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196723515","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:35:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:31:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d99bc/turbine/la-na-pol-refugee-policy-20170128/600"}],"video":[]}}

He has no problem with using federal funding for either purpose. \n \nNo matter how loudly local and state politicians scream and threaten court actions as he picks his fights, Trump will have the upper hand. Thanks to our reliance on federal funds for AIDS care, homelessness relief, Muni, housing and countless other programs \u2014 as a county as well as a city \u2014 San Francisco is extremely vulnerable. \n \nAnd don\u2019t think Trump doesn\u2019t have it in for us. The Kathryn Steinle killing was one of his first go-to examples during the campaign of the supposed threat posed by immigrants who are in the country illegally. Our sanctuary city ordinance has morphed over the years to become one of the most militant in the U.S. \n \nTrump may not legally be able to cut funding outright for vital services, but he could make compliance and cooperation with immigration laws part of the scoring process for receiving federal grants. That means we\u2019d probably lose money to more cooperative cities. \n \nIn typical Trump style, his executive orders the other day targeting sanctuary cities and border security were vague in terms of what the new rules will be. That leaves him plenty of room to maneuver. \n \nFor example, did you notice for all the talk around immigration, Trump has not said a word about H-1B specialty visas, many of which go to tech workers coming in from India? \n  More by Willie Brown   \nThose visas are a big benefit to Silicon Valley, whose leaders are now Trump\u2019s new best friends. \n  \nPresident Trump\u2019s bombastic handling of the media reminds me of my Uncle Itsy. \n \nEvery night, Uncle Itsy would go out onto the street with a pea and three little cups. He\u2019d take out the pea, shuffle the cups and take bets on which cup the pea was under. \n \nEvery night he came home with a hundred bucks in his pocket. \n \nFinally I asked him how the suckers never managed to pick which cup had the pea under it. \n \n\u201cI make such a show of shuffling the cups around that they never notice that pea is hidden in my hand.\u201d \n  \nFrom the looks of our nation\u2019s new Cabinet, you would think the South won the Civil War. \n \nHe\u2019s got Sonny Perdue, a Georga native, for Agriculture, and Tom Price, a Georgia resident for most of his adult life, for Health and Human Services. Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson and Energy Secretary nominee Rick Perry are from Texas. Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is from Alabama. From South Carolina we have U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. \n \nThey are the Confederate Cabinet. \n  \nRonnie Lott was in good spirits the other day at Le Central. The pro football Hall of Famer is trying hard to swing a deal to keep the Raiders in Oakland. He was looking for some hints on how to persuade NFL owners to reject the team\u2019s move to Las Vegas and get Raiders owner Mark Davis into negotiations with Lott\u2019s group. \n \nI had one word of advice: Money. I could have added, lots and lots of money. It\u2019s the only language the NFL understands. \n  \nMovie time: \u201cXXX: Return of Xander Cage.\u201d This new Vin Diesel-Samuel L. Jackson joyride has more stunts, more cliches and more special effects than would seem humanly possible. \n \nIt opens with Diesel skiing down a mountain with no snow and doesn\u2019t stop until every acrobat in China does a kung-fu tumble. It\u2019s made for Imax, and my bet is that it is going to rake in a great big pile. \n  \nBoard of Supervisors President London Breed invited me and a few of her friends to dinner at Alexander\u2019s Steakhouse. It\u2019s on Brannan between Third and Fourth. They serve up an entertaining combination of Asian and Midwestern cooking, but the prices are more like Fort Knox. \n \nThe steaks, and all you get is a steak, start at $50 and go up to $125. \n \nThe sides start at $9 and go up \u2014 and up. \n \nAnd the place was packed. We had to go to dinner at 5:45 p.m. just to get a table. \n \nThe server asked what kind of wine I wanted and I said, \u201cJust give me a glass of something that you would have at home.\u201d \n \nIt was 40 bucks. \n \nAs we were leaving, I went up to our server and, pointing at the empty $40 glass of wine, asked, \u201cIf that\u2019s what you serve at home, when can I come over?\u201d \n  \nIt\u2019s been a week, and the images of the huge Women\u2019s March down Market Street are still on my mind. We had 100,000 people walking in the pouring rain, messing up traffic for hours, and there wasn\u2019t a single complaint, arrest or overturned garbage can. \n \nThe after-party, hosted by Mark Mosher and his wife, Erica Waters, was the best. Marchers got admission to the party by sharing their protest signs. PG rated, of course. \n \nAmong the best: \u201cSuper-callous-fascist-racist-extra-braggadocious.\u201d Could not be missed: \u201cTwinkle, twinkle, little czar. Putin put you where you are.\u201d One that has become universal: \u201cWe shall over-comb.\u201d \n \nAnd I showed up with: \u201cMaybe all of you should have voted.\u201d \n \nWant to sound off?

He has shared some of his pictures and top tips to help inspire others in photography. \n \nHe said that one of his favourite places to take pictures in our region is the iconic Humber Bridge. \n Humber Bridge  \n\n \nThis is his picture of the Humber Bridge at night. He said that many photographer's like to take pictures of the bridge, but he tries to make his unique by taking pictures of it at night time. \n \nHe also said that he likes to take pictures of Normanby Hall including its ground and wildlife. \n Normanby Hall  \n\n \nMr Riach also said that Horkstow Bridge near the River Ancholme is also a top picture taking spot. He took this picture: \n \n Horkstow Bridge  \n\n \nMr Riach said that Horkstow Bridge is another one of his favourite locations to take pictures. \n \nHe has also taken pictures of buildings that might not immediately strike you as being good photo opportunities, such at the White Hart in Brigg. \n The White Hart  \n\n \nAnd he has also taken pictures of places and buildings in Scunthorpe that in every day life we might take for granted. \n \nMr Riach said: \"At The Pods you can get some lovely reflections from the pond.\" \n \nHe also gave these tips for anyone looking to get into photography: \n \n\"My advice is that if you're just starting and you're not sure if you'll continue with it, is not to spend to much initially. I started by buying cameras on Ebay,\" he said. \n \nHe added that it was best to start off with a more basic camera and to build up and that there are plenty of places to get help and advice. \n \nHe said: \"There are loads of online and Facebook amateur groups who share pictures and chat about their images and you can find tutorials on YouTube.\" \n \nTake a look at these pictures taken by Mr Riach in Scunthorpe \n The Pods \n \n\n \n Church Square  \n\n \n Ashby Ville Lake \n \n\n St Lawrence's Church  \n\n Buttercross  \n\n Wrawby Mill  \n\n \nRead today's top stories \n \n\n\n Follow us on","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Scunthorpe Telegraph"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"England news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Scunthorpe Telegraph published Top 10 photogenic places in northern Lincolnshire and top tips...","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Lincolnshire","zipCode":"DN15","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"North Lincolnshire","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Scunthorpe Telegraph","feed":{"genre":"Events","tags":[],"id":"169662407","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Scunthorpe Telegraph","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://scunthorpetelegraph.co.uk","publisher":"Local World"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.scunthorpetelegraph.co.uk/top-10-photogenic-places-in-northern-lincolnshire-and-top-tips-for-amateur-snappers/story-30079562-detail/story.html#comments","http://www.scunthorpetelegraph.co.uk/news","http://www.scunthorpetelegraph.co.uk/jobs","https://www.facebook.com/thisisscunny","https://twitter.com/ScunTelegraph"],"sequenceId":"695196741206","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:20:00Z","adultLanguage":"true","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.scunthorpetelegraph.co.uk/images/localworld/ugc-images/276413/Article/images/30079562/15822840-thumb.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Credit: A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute \n\nThe near-spherical outer structure of the dengue virus has been recreated in remarkable detail by a team of bioinformaticians in Singapore. The virtual model could show researchers how the virus fuses with and infects human cells at the molecular level. \"We want to understand the relationship between structure and dynamics along the pathway of fusion and infection, with a view to developing new vaccines and therapies,\" says Peter Bond, who, together with Chandra Verma, led the study at the A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute. \n\nDengue is a mosquito-borne virus that infects an estimated 400 million people a year, resulting in 21,000 deaths worldwide. It is a flavivirus\u2014the same family as the Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever. Flaviviruses share a common structure: a single-stranded RNA genome encased in a capsule made up of a fatty lipid sandwich stuffed with proteins called envelopes and membranes. \n\nOnce inside human cells, the smooth outer shell of the dengue virus forms spikes and fuses with the membrane of transport vesicles called endosomes, infecting the cell through the release of the viral genome. Researchers are particularly interested in how the external envelope proteins facilitate this process. \"These proteins are the first thing to come into contact with our immune system,\" says Bond. \"If we are going to protect ourselves, we need to recognize and, ideally, neutralize them.\" \n\nThe problem with standard experimental techniques such as cryoelectron microscopy for visualizing biological systems is that they can only detect ordered, uniform solids. Dengue's lipid membranes, however, are in a free-flowing state, somewhere between solid and liquid. Bond and Verma's teams overcame this hurdle using computational modeling, which applies Newton's laws of motion to a static structure \"to create a movie that zooms in on all the jiggling atoms.\" \n\nThey simulated the viral shell, and played with different components to see what happened with the overall structure. \"We used a Frankenstein-style approach to chop off bits of protein from the virus and see how it affected the morphology, a difficult job in the wet lab.\" \n\nSurprisingly, the membrane's curves seemed to be held in place by scaffolding proteins external to the membrane. And the positioning of envelope and membrane proteins was secured by specific interactions with negatively-charged lipids in the fatty membrane, a finding that could be exploited for treatment development. \n\nThe results have important implications for the fusion process (see image), which Bond and Verma plan to study in more detail through a larger Singapore-wide collaboration supported by the Ministry of Education. The teams are also expanding their scope to other flaviviruses, including Zika. \n\nMore information: J.K. Marzinek et al.

Infante Telegram & Gazette Staff @ocvictor  \nIncreasingly, it\u2019s becoming harder and harder to take water for granted. In Flint, Michigan, lead contamination poisoned the drinking water supply. California, the nation\u2019s largest agricultural producing state, has wrestled with a drought for five years, and we\u2019ve even dealt with a drought here in Worcester. And then there\u2019s Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota, where members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe have led a protest against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which they argue is a threat to their clean water supply, as well as to their ancestral burial grounds. Water, which seemingly runs so freely when you turn the tap, is suddenly among the country\u2019s most heatedly political things. \n \nThere have been numerous attempts to capture the conflicts brewing around water in song, but most attempts have landed flatly, cliché protest songs with very little depth. But somehow, Worcester musician Sean Ryder has managed to capture the urgency with his new song and music video, \u201cWater is Life (Boots are on the Ground).\u201d \n \n\u201cWater isn't sacred anymore,\u201d sings Ryder, \u201cThe river's black with oil and with blood./We can't drink that filth anymore./Bodies buried deep beneath the mud.\u201d \n \nIn many ways, it\u2019s a straight-up traditional protest song, born out of the large-scale protests that subsided when the Obama administration denied the project an easement to continue construction. Those protests are beginning to mobilize again, with President Trump\u2019s executive order to continue the project, so this song is particularly well-timed. \n \nThere\u2019s a tension between Ryder\u2019s restrained vocals and his fuzzed-out, heavily distorted guitar that gives the song a rich texture. Ryder imbues each verse with a sort of melancholy, one accentuated by the video\u2019s use of footage from the protests, including footage of armed soldiers and police officers attacking protesters, who are being beaten, pelted with tear gas and sprayed with hoses. \n \n\u201cThey'll tear us down swinging black batons,\u201d shouts Ryder, as the video reflects the reality of what he\u2019s singing, \u201cshoot pepper spray and tear gas in the crowd./Fire rubber bullets at our heads./Each wound a scar we'll wear it strong and proud.\u201d \n \nIt\u2019s not a happy song, but then, it\u2019s not a happy situation, and it\u2019s one that\u2019s set to begin again imminently. But even as Ryder offers the ominous refrain, \u201cboots are on the ground\u201d \u2014 casting the situation as an act of war, being waged against the indigenous population \u2014 one can still find a spark of hope burning in the song, a sense that, even though the odds are overwhelming, defiance isn\u2019t a lost cause. \n \nEmail Victor D.

Would it be a mistake to choose a winter fabric for a piece that will be in my living room all year round? \u2014 Andrea \n \nDear Andrea: Sofas are a major furniture piece and a focal point in your living room. They can also be costly, so I understand why you are questioning your decision. However, velvet is a classic choice that adds regal panache to any room. Velvet's short, densely woven fibers are luxurious to the touch and lovely to behold no matter what the season. Light plays with the nap, producing shadows and dimension to the cloth and the piece that it covers. We are seeing a heightened passion for jewel tones right now, with the rich hues of emerald green, plummy ruby reds and sapphire blues showing up in showrooms everywhere. \n \nVelvet covered chairs and sofas are favorite choices for traditional and period styles, but they also add panache to a contemporary setting. The furniture lines can be very simple, while the color and character of the velvet add dimension and interest to the sleek and minimal lines of the room. \n \nIt is easy to make the transition from cold to warm weather. Layer your blue sofa with white cotton cushions, and drape a summery pastel throw over the back. For all-year-round balance, look for an area carpet that has white running through it. Even a change in a table lamp will transform the mood. \n \nFor those who would like to experiment with velvet on a smaller scale, here's a fun winter project that will make you look like a couturier from a famous fashion house. The plush velvet cushions shown here have been decorated with a rubber stamp to give a subtle pattern to the fabric. It's heat from an iron that makes the impression in the nap of the velvet, and it won't work on nylon, polyester or washable velvets. Choose silk, rayon, rayon acetate or viscose. You'll find rubber stamps online and at craft stores. I used a peacock feather stamp. Cut your fabric to the size you choose \u2014 18-inch squares are a good size for a sofa. Add 5/8 inch on all sides for seam allowance. Practice stamping on velvet scraps first. Turn the iron on to the wool setting, but no steam. Place the stamp, rubber side up, on the ironing board. Lightly spray the back of the fabric with water. Lay the fabric right side (velvet) down on the stamp. Press the iron on the back of the fabric and DO NOT move it. Hold for about 20 seconds and then lift the iron off carefully. The image will be imprinted onto the velvet. \n \nMark the position of the images you wish to create on the velvet fabric with pins, and remove each pin before you iron. Repeat until you are happy with your design. Sew the cushion together and add tassels to the corners. \n \nI know that you will enjoy your blue velvet sofa for years, and when you decide to redecorate, it will be happy to take on a new look. \n \nDebbie Travis' House to Home column is produced by Debbie Travis and Barbara Dingle. Email questions to house2home@debbietravis.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Debbie Travis"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"House to Home: Velvet adds style to any type of decor","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Worcester","zipCode":"01615","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Worcester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Telegram.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"599979381","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"26"},"name":"Telegram.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.telegram.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196749746","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It had a headlight in the center of the grille that turned with the direction of the steering wheel. It sounds like a good idea to me. Why hasn't that idea been incorporated in other cars? I would appreciate your comments. - Harry \n \nRAY: The 1948 Tucker (called the Tucker 48) had a bunch of innovative safety features, including a perimeter frame for crash protection, a reinforced roof in case of rollovers, a padded dashboard and a shatterproof glass windshield - all stuff we take for granted today. \n \nBut most people remember that \"third eyeball,\" \"Cyclops\" headlight in the middle of the front grille that turned with the steering wheel. \n \nIt was a great idea, and guess what, Harry? You can now get it on a number of new cars, often as optional equipment. Not the third, middle eye, but regular headlights that swivel with the direction of the car. \n \nThey're called adaptive headlights, and they usually work with small electric motors that can adjust the aim of the headlights about 15 degrees in either direction. \n \nLike everything else these days, they use computer power to figure out how fast the car is going (so your headlights aren't flying back and forth every time you parallel park), the angle of the steering wheel and how quickly the car is turning. \n \nBased on those inputs, the electric motors aim the lights to try to keep their illumination on the road ahead of you while you're making a turn, rather than lighting up the trees at the side of the road. \n \nSome cars also use a separate \"side\"-pointing light for very-low-speed turning, like when you're turning off the road into a driveway. That can be helpful, too. \n \nThe adaptive headlights we've tested work really well. They're absolutely a desirable safety feature. I suspect they'll trickle down to more and more affordable cars over the next few years. \n \nBut even now, you can get them on certain (usually higher-end trim levels) cars as common as the VW Jetta, all new Minis, the Mazda 3 and 6, the 2017 Hyundai Elantra and the Subaru Outback. \n \nDo you really need that truck if you only make one trip to the lumberyard per year?

When I park on a hill and put the car in first gear, it creeps downhill in increments. This also happens when I add the hand brake at a \"reasonable\" pull. To get it to not creep down the hill, I have to pull the brake handle almost vertical. This seems wrong, but the dealer where I bought the car says they can't get it to lose position on a hill, and he tells me that engines these days have less compression. But my 2008 Subaru had even less compression than the Forester, and first gear held hills just fine. Is this the new normal? - Poke \n \nRAY: Under normal conditions, Poke, if you put your transmission in first gear or reverse, there ought to be enough compression in a 2.5-liter engine to keep the car from rolling. Of course, if you're on a steep hill, the weight of the car can overcome the compression of the engine and cause the car to move. \n \nThat's why we have, yes, the parking brake! And if pulling the parking-brake lever all the way up stops the car from rolling, that's exactly what you should do. The parking brake may need to be adjusted. You can ask your dealer to check it for you. \n \nYou also can chock the wheels by turning them toward the curb, which means the car would have to overcome both the inertia of the engine and the height of the curb to roll away.  \n \nMy other suggestion is to have the service manager come with you to where you park the car, and show him that it rolls. Even better, ask him to drive separately in another 2016 Forester so that you can compare the two. \n \nIf another new 2016 Forester stays put, then I suppose your compression could be bad or your clutch could be slipping. But I find either of those possibilities unlikely because (1) the car is brand-new and you'd notice poor performance if the compression were bad, and (2) you've been driving stick shifts for five decades and presumably haven't burned out the clutch in 3,600 miles. \n \nI'm guessing this has mostly to do with where you park. You can try using reverse instead of first, as it often has a slightly taller gear ratio. But I think you'll find that the ultimate solution is to make regular and firm use of the parking brake, Poke. \n \nBumps and potholes do more than merely annoy drivers.

As executed in the 2017 Kia Cadenza Limited sedan, it is more than a good marketing strategy. It is an approach to the U.S. car market that could upset traditional notions of automotive luxury and serve notice to the likes of Infiniti, Lexus and - yes - even BMW and Mercedes-Benz. \n \nWe are talking in terms of exterior beauty, interior materials and design, structural integrity, and advanced electronic safety and driver assistance technology. \n \nDrive feel and handling are not bad, either. They are not as good as that of a BMW 5-series, a Mercedes-Benz AMG model or an Audi 7. But feel and handling in the Kia Cadenza are very good. And if you've never been behind the steering wheel of a BMW 5-series or an Audi A7, you won't miss or regret never having done so as the driver of a Kia Cadenza. \n \nYou won't miss the pricing of those traditional high-end cars, either. Even fully loaded, with nearly all driver assistance and advanced electronic safety options and Kia's highest trim level, the Limited, the Cadenza beats traditional luxury car prices at $45,290, including factory-to-dealer shipment charges. \n \nIn 2014, when the Cadenza was introduced, it was an easily ignorable bargain in comparison with traditional luxury competitors. No longer. The 2017 model is substantially improved. Exterior design does more than imitate something traditional. It sets its own standard with a catchy vertical, concave grille. Rear-end LED taillights are attractive. The entire exterior is muscular yet smooth, simple and overall attractive. \n \nThe interior, done with quilted Nappa leather seat trim, feels rich. Equipped with reliable, easily controllable seat heater, the Cadenza Limited feels especially comfortable on a subfreezing winter's day.  \n \nAdvanced electronic safety is everywhere in this one. Its systems include windshield heads-up display combining information on blind-side monitoring and lane-departure warning; forward-collision mitigation; hill-start assist control, which helps ease any fears of rollback on steep inclines; and rear cross-traffic alert and parking assistance. \n \nIt is available in three trim levels - Premium, Technology and Limited. Buy the Technology if you want the best value in a Cadenza. Buy the Limited if you want the Cadenza with most available options.  \n \nAll Cadenza models are front-wheel-drive and equipped with a gasoline 3.3-liter, fuel-injected V-6 (290 horsepower, 253 pound-feet of torque). The engine is smooth and responsive. But, no, it won't impress anyone fond of scooting around in an Audi A7. Who cares? Just think of what the A7 costs. \n \nNuts & Bolts \n \n2017 Kia Cadenza \n \nBottom line: The Kia Cadenza is automotive luxury with value. The Cadenza Technology probably is the best value in this line. The Cadenza Limited is the safest and most comfortable. \n \nRide, acceleration and handling: I've been thinking about this category for a while, stung by the criticism that I am a conservative in this area. I am not conservative. I just drive a lot, and I am convinced that the Cadenza Limited will please most drivers who obey traffic laws. \n \nHead-turning quotient: It is a beautifully styled car inside and out. \n \nBody style/layout: The Cadenza is a full-sized, luxury, front-engine, front-wheel-drive sedan, completely restyled for 2017. \n \nEngine/transmission: It comes with a 3.3-liter, 24-valve, fuel-injected V-6 (290-horsepower, 253 foot-pounds of torque) with variable valve timing. The engine is linked to an eight-speed automatic transmission that also can be operated manually via steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters. \n \nCapacities: Seating is for five people. Cargo capacity is 16 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 18.5 gallons of gasoline. Regular grade works fine. \n \nMileage: I averaged 22 miles per gallon combined city-highway with lots of idling in the city because of subfreezing weather and light snow. \n \nSafety: Standard equipment includes ventilated front disc and solid rear disc brakes; four-wheel anti-lock brake protection; emergency braking assistance; stability and traction control; blind side monitoring and lane-departure warning; post-collision and pre-collision safety systems; side and head air bags. \n \nPricing: The 2017 Kia Cadenza Limited starts at $44,390. Price as tested is $45,290, including $900 factory-to-dealer shipment charge.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Warren Brown Special to The Washington Post"},"topics":[{"name":"Hyundai Motor Company news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Volkswagen news","group":"Companies"}],"title":"'Affordable luxury' gets real with Kia's Cadenza","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Worcester","zipCode":"01615","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Worcester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Telegram.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"599979381","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"26"},"name":"Telegram.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.telegram.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196750940","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I\u2019d say that\u2019s not a bad start. Nobody paid much attention to the content of his message, so lost we all got in the endless back-and-forth about the size of his audience. Well, enough already. If you can\u2019t say what you want to say in 15 minutes, you might just as well sum it up in a Tweet, which would be shorter by at least seven words and take only a twelfth of the time to read off the teleprompter. \n \nIt\u2019s a pretty well known fact that our first president, George Washington, orated for precisely two minutes on his, and they named the whole city after him. Poor William Henry Harrison went on for an hour and three quarters. He spoke in a raging snowstorm, and died of pneumonia a month later. I see no record that the media of his day second-guessed either the length of his speech or his choices of outdoor clothing. \n \nI always liked the story about Woodrow Wilson. One member of his cabinet, perhaps kissing up to the big boss, congratulated him on the brevity of his addresses, and asked how long it took him to write them. \u201cIt depends,\u201d the president told him, \u201cIf I\u2019m to speak for 10 minutes, I need a week for preparation; if 15 minutes, three days; if half an hour, two days; if an hour, I\u2019m ready now.\u201d \n \nThe words people seem to listen for most are, \u201cI do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d When \n \nRichard Nixon heard the address by John Kennedy, the man who had just defeated him, he remarked to one of JFK\u2019s aides, \u201cI wish I had said some of those things.\u201c \n \nThe aide asked, \u201cWhat part? The part about \u2018ask not what your country can do for you\u2019?\" \n \n\u201cNo,\u201d Nixon, not noted for his humor said, \u201cThe part that starts, \u201cI do solemnly swear ... \u201d \n \nPresident Trump showed himself to be nothing if not consistent. As always, he repeated sentences he personally liked. Are they up there on the teleprompter, I wonder, or is he able to remember them for the two seconds they remain on the screen? \n \nSome critics (the ones who were able to tear themselves away from the prolonged discussions about the crowd size) suggested the address lacked poetry and didn\u2019t soar in the manner of many of his predecessors. \n \nThat put me in mind of an experiment by Mike Royko, the late great columnist for the Chicago Trib. He fed Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address into a computer programmed to critique writing by analyzing \u201cstylistic errors.\u201d To Abe\u2019s opening line, \u201cFourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal,\u201d the unimpressed robot sniffed, \u201cLong sentences can be difficult to read and understand. Consider revising so that no more than one complete thought is expressed in each sentence.\u201d In other words, \u201cWhere\u2019s the window dressing, you hack?\u201d \n \nI could see the president was itching to put the speech behind him and get on with making America great again. Making America great again. (He says almost everything twice just in case you missed it the first time. If you took away those repetitions, I guess he may have spoken only seven and a half minutes.) Anyway, the man has been busy. His aides get calls in the middle of the night. Rumor has it they sleep in their suits. I doubt the report that his staffers all have serious cases of the bends and are being treated in a hyperbaric facility somewhere in Georgetown. \n \nFake news. Fake news.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Sid McKeen: 'I do solemnly swear,' and then some","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Worcester","zipCode":"01615","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Worcester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Telegram.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"599979381","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"26"},"name":"Telegram.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.telegram.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196751262","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The birds he watched \u201clived in gardens of steel, glass, concrete, and electricity. There was a bird with a plastic \u2018frozen mango\u2019 bag on its face and another bird nesting in a shattered light fixture. \u2026 The birds were doing ordinary bird things \u2014 perching, flying, preening, hunting, nest-building \u2014 but there was no doubt that they were of rather than above the mess and grit and trash of the world.\u201d \n \nAnd so she asks if she can accompany the musician on a bird walk. \u201cI wanted to be enraptured and feel I was still inspirable,\u201d she writes. \n \nOne bird walk turns into a year of birding, during which Maclear meditates on her past, her parents, her marriage, books she loves, the nature of art, death, happiness, climate change and whatever else comes to her fertile, deeply curious mind. Though structured as a chronological memoir, hers is not a typical \u201cyear in the life\u201d narrative. Each chapter is built around bird observations, but her excursions to the urban-bird habitats serve mainly as jumping-off points for her intelligent and thoughtful ramblings. \n \nHer metaphors and verbs are often bird-inspired, but these allusions feel natural, never forced, and her descriptions are vivid and original: \u201cA horned grebe sporting a punky Klaus Nomi hairdo put on a little show, diving and disappearing.\u201d Hooded mergansers have \u201ccrests resembling Elizabethan bridal hats. They dove for barnacles while giant ice cubes clinked around them.\u201d A solitary male gadwall \u201cstayed still long enough for me to fixate on its delicate herringbone feather pattern.\u201d \n \nOccasionally she takes her sons birding with her, and when the younger one grows tired, she gathers him up \u201cuntil he was folded in my arms like a futon.\u201d \n \nOn one walk, fairly early on, she recalls the birds that smashed into the windows of her elementary school when she was a child. \u201cI remember their little matchstick legs poking up at the sky,\u201d she writes. \u201cI remember thinking it seemed cruel that a bird should be punished for believing it could fly.\u201d \n \nMaclear, who lives in Toronto, writes books for children, and her prose here is direct and clear, each sentence carrying as much weight as a line in a picture book, or in a poem. \u201cIf you listen to birds,\u201d she writes, \u201cevery day will have a song in it.\u201d \n \nThis book is a lovely song \u2014 a symphony \u2014 for all of us.

(The landlord wanted more of it.) \n \nWhich meant John Wayne Gacy's clown suit and John Dillinger's death mask and James Caan's pistol from \"The Godfather\" might have gone back into assorted collections and attics. But no. \n \nInstead, the museum was to move to Tennessee and reopen as the Alcatraz East Crime Museum. It was to sit comfortably on Pigeon Forge's six-lane, slow-moving Parkway in a neighborhood that already included the Hatfield & McCoy Dinner Show, the Hollywood Wax Museum, Smoky Mountain Opry, Wonder Works, Dolly Parton's Lumberjack Adventure and, of course, Dollywood. And pancake joints and go-kart tracks and hotels and motels and outlet malls and T-shirt emporia. \n \n\"I just really felt a visitor to the Pigeon Forge area was our visitor type,\" said Janine Vaccarello, chief operating officer. \"They love our country, they love military, they love law enforcement, love guns - they embrace exactly what we are.\" \n \nBut Nov. 23, as workers were tweaking and installing and polishing for the planned Dec. 16 opening, came the first report of a wildfire near Chimney Tops Trail, a scenic hiker route in the national park about seven miles south of Gatlinburg. \n \nDays later, with the fire still feeding, came high-wind warnings. Then, reports of more fire in the mountains, and the fires were spreading. Evacuation notices, first for Gatlinburg and then for Pigeon Forge as well, went out Nov. 28. \n \n\"'Please contain it,'\" Vaccarello recalled saying to herself. \" 'Do not enter this Parkway area.' There were already fires in that area. You could smell them. But they were in very rural areas.\" \n \nThe fire didn't enter the Pigeon Forge Parkway area. \n \n\"We didn't have any loss of life here,\" said Leon Downey, executive director of the Pigeon Forge Department of Tourism. \"All of our businesses continued to operate.\" \n \nIt entered Gatlinburg. \n \nGatlinburg lost 14 lives. More than 2,400 structures were destroyed or damaged, including the home of the town's mayor. \n \nThe city's oldest hotel is the Gatlinburg Inn. It was built on the city's Parkway (narrower and even slower than Pigeon Forge's) in 1937. Its guests have included Liberace and Lady Bird Johnson. The song \"Rocky Top\" was written in one of its rooms. Its general manager is Gary Bailey. \n \n\"The mountain behind the hotel,\" he said, \"was completely on fire.\" \n \nFor more than a week, this city of 3,900 \u2014 which annually funnels 10 million visitors to the nation's most-visited national park \u2014 was on lockdown. \n \n\"You had to show ID to get in,\" Bailey said, \"and you had to be out by a certain time. And that was due to safety concerns, plus I'm assuming there were concerns about people getting in and looting some of the businesses that were closed. \n \n\"We didn't have any of that.\" \n \nWhat they had was, mostly, a sense of relief. \n \n\"When we came into town for the first time, we realized, 'Hey, it was bad, but on the whole, Gatlinburg is still intact.' \" \n \nTrue, some motels were remnants. Many places to stay and shops \u2014 downtown Gatlinburg, more sedate than Pigeon Forge, is primarily shops and little restaurants \u2014 suffered smoke damage. \n \nOn back roads, charred houses and cabins were in evidence. Skeletal bicycles and melted stoves and gutted automobiles were grim reminders. Blackened trees and brush told their own stories. \n \n\"This was kind of everybody's first rodeo,\" Bailey said. \"It was traumatic to see. And, of course, some people lost their lives \u2014 people that we know.\" \n \nDiana Wolfe takes reservations at Twin Cedar Cabins in Gatlinburg. The company owns nine rental cabins. Two were lost in the fire. She knows others were less fortunate. \n \n\"It's a disaster that we're dealing with,\" she said. \"People call and say, 'Why would we want to come there? Everything is gone.' \n \n\"Well, it's not gone. Gatlinburg is open, ready for business. We were all affected, we all lost things, we're all recovering \u2014 but if these people don't come back, then we're really going to be devastated.\" \n \nApproaching Christmas, most Gatlinburg hotels that stood near-empty during the cleanup were busy again. Almost all shops and eateries and attractions had reopened, and those still closed were expected to be ready soon. Parkway was back to its usual crawl; sidewalks were seasonally busy. \n \nYes, Gatlinburg was open for business, and people were coming back. \n \n\"Generations of families have traveled here and have memories of their vacations here, of throwing rocks in the river and whitewater rafting ... and having pancakes\" said Marci Claude, of the Gatlinburg Convention and Visitors Bureau. \"And they grieve with you. \n \n\"And then they support you.\" \n \nAnd there's also this. \n \n\"People can look at the bad side, if they want,\" said Steve Ellis, who handles sales and marketing for Parton properties in Pigeon Forge. \"But all the stuff's going to be rebuilt. Carpenters, electricians, you go to get lumber - it's jobs.\" \n \nOn Dec. 16, authorities declared the fires in Great Smoky Mountains National Park nearly 100 percent contained and stopped issuing bulletins. \n \nBack in Pigeon Forge, all was absolutely normal. Dollywood, the amusement park, reopened the first weekend in December. Other attractions were doing fine despite the inevitable misconceptions. \n \n\"I talked to a lady the other day,\" said Ellis, \"and she thought the mountains physically burned. The mountains themselves. She said, 'Is it flat up there now?' \n \n\"If people came here before, there's no difference.\" \n \nTwo days before Christmas, thanks to good work by first-responders and a blessed event - rain - the national park lifted its ban on campfires. \n \nAnd Dec. 16, right on time, the Alcatraz East Crime Museum \u2014 like everything in Pigeon Forge and almost everything in Gatlinburg \u2014 was open for business. \n \n\"Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever.\" - Dolly Parton lyric","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Alan Solomon Chicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Natural disasters news","group":"Science"}],"title":"After devastating wildfires, Gatlinburg, Tenn., welcomes back tourists","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Worcester","zipCode":"01615","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Worcester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Telegram.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"599979381","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"26"},"name":"Telegram.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.telegram.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196752229","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Simonett, leader of the progressive bluegrass-rock band Trampled by Turtles, works under the banner of Dead Man Winter on \"Furnace\" to delve into the dissolution of his marriage and the splintering of his family. It's a deeply personal album he says he put out only after \"a long and violent debate with myself.\" From the wrenching first stanza of \"This House is On Fire,\" Simonett spins the desolate landscape of his heartbreak into art. Cut live-to-tape in rustic Cannon Falls, Minnesota, the album sets achy lyrics against an elegant acoustic backdrop that accentuates the hurt but never veers into self-indulgence. That Simonett delivers it without wallowing in self-pity or defensive rationalizations about why things didn't work out is a monumental achievement. \"Mockingbird, you come to my window, in the dead of night, to see if we're all right,\" he sings with clear-eyed solemnity in the elegiac \"Weight of the World.\" ''The moonlight in your eyes, and then you're gone.\" You'd have to go back decades to find a more cathartic breakup album \u2014 perhaps as far as Bob Dylan's \"Blood on the Tracks,\" the gold standard for such things. \"Furnace\" reassures us that the human heart is beautiful even when it's in anguish. Its memorable anthems to lost intimacy and disconnection will remind those who have been there that they're not so alone after all. \u2014 Scott Stroud, The Associated Press \n \n\"a girl a bottle a boat,\" by Train  \n \nSome people simply adore Train. Others simply loathe them. The band's new album is unlikely to change anyone's mind. The band \u2014 now without lead guitarist and founding member Jimmy Stafford \u2014 has returned with an unmemorable, fluffy and yet desperately needy soft-rock CD, \"a girl a bottle a boat.\" Train, the band behind \"Drops Of Jupiter (Tell Me)\" and \"Meet Virginia,\" is once again as edgy and raw as a Labradoodle puppy. If Train was an article of clothing, it would be mom jeans. Take \"Play That Song,\" the new CD's first single. It's instantly cloying and catchy \u2014 the way \"Hey, Soul Sister\" was \u2014 until you realize they've swiped the melody from \"Heart and Soul,\" the Hoagy Carmichael tune kids learn to play on the piano. Fans will adore it. Others will consider it a crime against rock. On the new 11-song disc, Train tries some doo-wop (\"Valentine\"), some faux-Coldplay (\"Drink Up\"), dance-pop (\"Lost and Found\") and a bombastic piano ballad (\"You Better Believe\"). But it's all so very limp, especially coming off their completely unnecessary remake of \"Led Zeppelin II\" last year. Even the album's comma-less title \u2014 apparently advocating drunken boating? \u2014 doesn't really fit the vibe. The best song is \"Working Girl,\" but it's marred by typically atrocious lyrics that rhyme \"game\" with \"Aspartame\" and \"never been\" with \"Ritalin.\" Still, lead singer Patrick Monahan does have this advice for anyone firmly anti-Train: \"If you don't like it, let me get the door for you.\" \u2014 Mark Kennedy, The Associated Press  \n \n\"Graveyard of Good Times,\" by Brandon Can't Dance \n \nBrandon Can't Dance is the nom de indie rock of Philadelphia songwriter Brandon Ayres. In the manner of rising DIY stars like Car Seat Headrest and Alex G (with whom he has toured), Ayres has followed several self-releases on his Bandcamp page over a number of years with this official coming-out party on the Lucky Number label. It's a bit of a jumble, with Ayres sometimes sounding like a collection of influences: vocals that alternately recall Elliott Smith, Wayne Coyne, and Ira Kaplan of Yo La Tengo, and songs that mix synthy dance-floor moves (\"Smoke & Drive Around\"), 1980s Europop (\"Pop Queen of the Teen Scene\") and tongue-in-cheek self-mockery (\"So Deep, So Tortured, So Freak\"). But the catchy tunes keep coming over the course of a 16-track album on which Ayres is too intent on enjoying himself to worry about the identity crisis he'll surely outgrow. \u2014 Dan DeLuca, The Philadelphia Inquirer \n \n\"London Fog 1966,\" by The Doors \n \nBefore The Doors celebrate a golden anniversary in March with a three-LP take on their still-provocative debut (\"The Doors: 50th Anniversary Deluxe Edition\"), the never- before-released origin-story tapes of their time as a house band at \"fantastic L.A.'s\" London Fog \u2014 a Sunset Strip dive bar \u2014 finally arrive. Good. Though The Doors presented shamanic monotone poet Jim Morrison, cabaret organist Ray Manzarek, and company as fully formed psychedelic sensualists whose snaky sound reflected a darker California than the usual sunshine dream of the era, the quartet's roots were in raw rural blues. When drummer John Densmore and guitarist Robby Krieger find the pocket of Big Joe Williams' \"Baby, Please Don't Go,\" they burrow deep. When Morrison reaches into his personal primordial ooze to appropriate Muddy Waters' hurt for \"I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man,\" you hear how The Doors' next steps were logical progressions of a blue-black start. Minus any studio cleansing, these tunes are crackling gut-punch jazz-psychedelia shot through with Morrison's meaty croon. Here's hoping Rhino finds more tapes. \u2014 A.D. Amorosi,  The Philadelphia Inquirer \n \n\"Hidden Figures: The Album,\" Various Artists \n \nTo tell \"Hidden Figures'\" rarely heard story of the brainy African-American women working at NASA at the dawn of the 1960s, director-screenwriter Theodore Melfi brought in nu-soul auteur Pharrell Williams to compose, star in, and oversee its soundtrack, co-compose its score (with Hans Zimmer), and produce the film. Rather than shrink at the responsibility, Williams rises high; not just with sweet retrofit R&B appropriate to the Motown era and the optimism of the space race, but with his usual sunny disposition pop-hop, this time tinged with strains of gentle folk and sacred song. Though the former describes Williams' own chipper anthem \"Runnin',\" the gloriously emboldened \"I See a Victory\" encompasses the Virginia native's rich gospel inspirations. Williams offers similar raw religiosity for duet partner Lalah Hathaway on \"Surrender.\" Along with producing grand raging tracks for Mary J. Blige (\"Mirage\") and saving a hint of hard soul for himself (\"Crystal Clear\"), Williams _ with movie costar Janelle Monae _ tackles \"Jalapeno\" and brings back another side of his sound, the blistering electro-rock-funk of his onetime band N.E.R.D. More of that _ please _ would have added a star to this review. \u2014 A.D.

Romanesque arches run in lines along the textured walls of much of the dining area, matched by mirrors of the same shape and size in the remaining portion. The cityscape and still-life paintings between the arched openings, like Teresa\u2019s food offerings, wear the Ferrentino family\u2019s birthplace proudly. The dark wooden tables add a rustic vibe. \n \nMost of the dinners, from $10 pasta to $27 Zuppa de Pesce, offer soup of the day or salad and a starch. These number more than 60 entrée selections. And that\u2019s not counting grinders, an eight-item children\u2019s menu from chicken fingers to stuffed shells, all $7-$8, and a page of specialty pizzas. \n \nMany but not all are red-sauce items, and the half-dozen veal dinners don\u2019t simply mimic the chicken selections. There is a larger array of seafood, from fried American favorites to Haddock Florentine with Spinach and a Cream Lemon Sauce ($18), and several more. Several beef selections are on or off the menu. Our Saturday-night entrance was greeted by the specials chalkboard that spoke of two prime ribs, Italian and regular. Our server never spoke of the specials to us, so good thing for you I was in a literate frame of mind. \n \nWhen it comes to appetizers it\u2019s pretty darn Italian, running from $7 to $11 (no Buffalo wings here) with your calamaris to your antipastos and but also including Joe\u2019s Polpette including two meatballs in marinara sauce and ricotta cheese ($9). And there are five selections with add-ons from scallops to steak, besides the side salads so easy to get with dinner. \n \nIn this general area I paused at the Tortellini Soup ($3 or $5) but went with a Meat Tortellini Alfredo ($8) appetizer \u2014 there\u2019s also a $15 meal portion \u2014 and soup of the day, Orzo Minestrone, that was included with my entrée. I never looked back. \n \nThe tortellini had trace amounts of sausage which lent not as much flavor as the blend of Romano, Parmsan and mozzarella cheeses that bathed the perfectly cooked pasta. The soup\u2019s tomato broth was talking to me with its peppery flavor and wide assortment of vegetables, reassuring me that it was just what the doctor ordered for my early-stage sore throat. \n \nSometimes a place in its fourth decade is still doing the same with bread it was when it opened, but I can\u2019t imagine that\u2019s the case here. The rolls before dinner came warm with a medium-crisp crust and airy soft insides, served with an herb-garlic olive oil. \n \nBy dinner we chickened out. My companion\u2019s Chicken Broccoli with EVOO and Garlic ($16) over pasta did all it\u2019s supposed to do, with large chicken chunks and a boatload of broccoli. \n \nI went with Chicken Breast a la Calabrese, a large rolled breast topped with mozzarella cheese in a buttery sherry wine sauce ($18). Cut inside the tender tube and let flow a molten river of mozzarella with parsely, reaching a waiting throng of button-size mushrooms that accompany this rich, rich dish. The accompanying pasta, on the side, had a sweet, chunky marinara sauce for contrast. Leave the cardiologist at home and take a dive into this dish. \n \nAn adequate tiramisu was $6 at the top end of a dessert selection of cannoli, ice cream cake roll or cheesecake with or without strawberries. Dessert was, at this point, too much to finish even while splitting it \u2014 but no surprise here. The pleasant surprise was dinner for two, coffee/tea included, was right around $50 for a generous, multicourse spread, before taxes and tip. \n \nIt could have been a busier night, as evidenced by the squad of servers seeming to await a Saturday-night full house that never arrived. While there were families and young children aplenty as well as elder parties, a swath may have been held away by a Patriots playoff game running at the same time. \n \nTo say Teresa\u2019s was ready and able to serve would be a vast understatement; it\u2019s known also as a banquet and special events place, remember? But seven days a week, even the casual evening diner can simply be ready to be well taken care of.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Bob Datz Telegram &amp; Gazette Reviewer"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Italy news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Dining Review: Italian flavor overarches diners at Teresa\u2019s","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Worcester","zipCode":"01615","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Worcester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Telegram.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"599979381","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"26"},"name":"Telegram.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.telegram.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196752731","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Then he heads to the basement, takes out a prayer mat, sets a timer for five minutes and does everything but pray before returning upstairs when the clock runs out. \n \nMany comedies - and certainly many comedies under Apatow's guiding hand - would play the scene for maximum (and likely raunchy) laughs. (In many comedies, the lead character wouldn't be a Pakistani Muslim, either, but that's another matter.) Yet a more serious tone percolates here. The son has given up tradition, but hardly happily, and there's something a little touching, even sad, about him having to conceal his choice. \n \nThe moment provides an early signal of a film far more interested in sympathizing with alternate points of view than in exploiting them for easy laughs. That idea is underscored later when the character and his parents argue angrily about the assimilationist direction their son's life has taken, a scene you'd more likely find in a Salman Rushdie novel than the movie of a man who made \"Knocked Up.\" \n \nAh, but Apatow is not the only influence here. The director is Michael Showalter, also behind the zany humanity of last year's hit \"Hello, My Name Is Doris.\" And the character is an aspiring stand-up comedian played by Kumail Nanjiani, the Karachi-born \"Silicon Valley\" star. Nanjiani spent three years writing the script with his wife, Emily Gordon, basing it on the couple's rocky, real-life courtship - and, equally important, his own fraught relationship with his traditionalist Muslim parents. \n \nWhen \"The Big Sick\" made its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on Friday night, it instantly distinguished itself as an early breakout and something of a unicorn. (Spoiler alert for the next paragraph: Skip ahead if you want to avoid.) \n \nStarring Zoe Kazan as Emily (and with terrific supporting turns by Ray Romano and Holly Hunter as her parents), \"Sick\" traces what happens when - deep breath - the young couple fall in love, he conceals from Emily his parents' insistence that he marry a Pakistani woman (and her existence from his parents), the couple have an explosive breakup, she becomes unexpectedly seriously ill, he has to navigate her parents while she's incapacitated and, oh, yes, also pursues his faltering career as a two-bit comedian. \n \nIndeed, for a small movie, Nanjiani packs a lot of ambition on its shoulders: dating, career paths, intergenerational religious conflict, mortality, Muslims in post-9/11 America and the plight of the stand-up comic (hey, it's still an Apatow movie). \n \nBoth Apatow and Nanjiani, for all his dry-as-the Kharan Desert delivery, are keen to make the comedic moments ripple with danger. \n \nWhen Romano's dad character fumbily asks Kumail his thoughts about 9/11, the Pakistani American replies, \"You're asking my position on 9/11? Well, I'm anti. (Pause) We lost 19 of our best men.\" \n \nBut it's also a movie with emotion overflowing at every turn. I've rarely found the redemption in an Apatow movie - for all the talk about \"heart\" and \"sweetness\" - to feel especially close to how those moments play out in real life. Not so here, where the feeling of missed opportunities and human connection resonates like the real thing. \n \nPartly that's a function of an indie/Sundance movie. And partly it's a function of Nanjiani and Gordon pouring their own lives into the script. (They've now been married 10 years.) \n \nI asked Nanjiani at an after-party how they found the dramatic-comedy balance. \"It was about trying to make a movie like 'Tootsie' or 'Broadcast News' - a movie where the dramatic scenes are really dramatic and the comedic scenes are really funny,\" he said. \"Most dramatic comedies now try too much to walk a line, they're only a little funny and only a little dramatic.\" \n \nOf course, trying to do really funny and really serious could make a film wildly bitonal, swinging too much from one moment to the next. For the most part, he avoids this problem. \n \nTaking the stage at the premiere, Gordon noted her smooth relationship with Nanjiani's parents, and she was asked how they finally reached a good place. She deferred to the man who was for so long caught between them. \n \n\"A lot of (messed-up) dinners,\" Nanjiani quipped, echoing a line from the movie. \"We took the first step of 40 on the road to reconciliation. (Pause) We're in the low 30s right now.\" \n \n\"The Big Sick\" was purchased at the festival for $12 million by Amazon Studios.

Farhadi won the foreign-language Oscar in 2012 for \"A Separation.\" \n \nEurope's gaze at itself was revealing. Germany's \"Toni Erdmann\" sets Eastern European capitalism as a backdrop for the strained relationship between a conformist daughter and her prankster father. Denmark's \"Land of Mine\" raises questions about morality and blame as German soldiers clear land mines on a beach. \"A Man Called Ove\" from Sweden looks at immigration through the eyes of a suicidal railroad worker. \n \nThe nominated films explore the fissures, bonds, expectations and unpredictability of relationships, especially when characters are forced to confront change. \"The Salesman\" hits all these notes as a couple navigate vengeance, fear and the insecurities of home after a wife is attacked by a stranger in the shower. That film, like \"Toni Erdmann,\" directed by Maren Ade, draws the viewer deep into the intricacies of psychology and emotion. \n \n\"It's in crisis that we reveal our true selves,\" Farhadi recently told The Times. \"Film to me is like a court trial. The spectator is the judge.\" \n \n\"Toni Erdmann\" has been a favorite of critics, but the way it tests the bounds of family troubles - the father (Winfried) is a rambling jokester who wears oversized fake teeth and an outfit that makes him look like Bigfoot - is bracingly unconventional. Perhaps too much for some in the academy. The unsentimental film crystallizes German sardonic wit, yet it movingly plays on Winfried's act-of-love strategy to embarrass his daughter (Ines) until he frees her from her rigid mask. \n \n\"Tanna\" summons a different kind of existential crisis amid battling tribes in the South Pacific. Unfolding amid thatched huts, grass skirts and a flickering volcano, the film, based on a true story, centers on the fate of two lovers after one of them is chosen to marry someone in an opposing clan to keep peace and preserve island culture. Directed by Bentley Dean and Martin Butler, the film is a picturesque paean to a way of life far from the tug of modern forces. \n \n\"Land of Mine\" glimpses the dangerous irony of changing fortunes. It explores compassion, hate and justice along a Danish beach where Nazis had laid 45,000 land mines to prevent an Allied invasion. But the Danish army is back in control and has pressed German POWs into the meticulous task of clearing the mines. Directed by Martin Zandvliet, the movie follows \"A War,\" about the Afghanistan conflict, as the second Danish film in two years to be nominated for an Academy Award. \n \nWhimsy mixes with Scandinavian stoicism in a \"A Man Called Ove,\" directed by Hannes Holm, after a laid-off railroad worker and recent widower attempts to hang himself. The title character is a gruff bore who becomes enamored with his Iranian immigrant neighbor in a tender story that speaks to larger questions of culture and diversity that have been agitating Europe in recent years. \n \n\"No one should be all on their own,\" Ove's neighbor tells him. \"Not even you.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jeffrey Fleishman Los Angeles Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Denmark news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Foreign-language Oscar picks: World of turmoil turns to escapism","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Worcester","zipCode":"01615","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Worcester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Telegram.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"599979381","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"26"},"name":"Telegram.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.telegram.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196753147","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Classes are out of session, and it's prime time for a school holiday, particularly a weeklong cruise. However, there are some suggestions we'd recommend considering to ensure smooth sailing before and during the season: \n \nReserve Your Voyage Well in Advance \n \nWith so many children off school, spring break (like Christmas) is one of the busiest times of the year for family trips, and that means plenty of people will want to book a cruise during the same exact window as you. \n \nParents of schoolchildren with schedules slightly staggered - Easter break versus spring break, for instance - from mainstream schedules have a slight edge, but ships will fill up quicker during either period. To make sure you get the cabin choice you want, book early. Doing so even a full year or longer out is not a bad idea. \n \nBudget for Higher Cruise Fares \n \nRegardless of how soon you make a spring break booking, it is very likely to be more expensive than those made for the off-season. So, expect higher prices and budget accordingly. Alternatively, keep an eye out for cruise specials during the year that may apply to spring sailings to try and save some money at least. In many cases, third and fourth guests in a cabin can sail for reduced rates or completely free. \n \nExpect More Children and Teens \n \nIt should go without saying, but your family will not be the only family onboard. Spring-break cruises see some of the greatest numbers of children and teens of the entire year. That means kids clubs, pools and the buffet will be far more crowded, especially on family-friendly cruise lines such as Carnival Cruise Line, Disney Cruise Line, MSC Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line, Princess Cruises and Royal Caribbean International. \n \nBook an Alternative Cruise Line \n \nIf you're a family with older children or teens less interested in traditional kids facilities at sea, you might do well to consider a different cruise line to find more breathing room away from lots of youngsters. \n \nEven premium, upscale and luxury lines are likely to receive more families during spring break than usual, but they will be less overrun with children than standard mainstream brands. Celebrity Cruises and Holland America Line still feature kids facilities, for example, and are great for multigenerational travelers as well. \n \nBe Considerate of Passengers Without Kids \n \nNot everyone else onboard for spring break necessarily has children of their own. While those without kids onboard are sure to expect a fair share of juvenile encounters, they surely will appreciate good behavior from all offspring. So, please be mindful that you are sharing this vacation with strangers who will thank you for keeping your children from screaming and running up and down the halls. A little discipline goes a long way. \n \nTake Advantage of Exclusive Venues \n \nFamily members like to sail because of the great travel memories that can be made together, but everyone occasionally enjoys some time to themselves. That's why cruise lines include spaces just for children and just for adults to escape to. \n \nMom and dad might enjoy a cocktail and entertainment in the evening while their children are having a blast in the kids club. The benefit of a cruise ship is neither group is ever far apart, and a rendezvous back at the cabin afterward is super easy. \n \nPick Another Time of Year \n \nIdeally, to avoid the need to adhere to any of the tips above, your family might prefer a different time altogether. School holidays in the middle of the year are compressed with little wiggle room for planning. \n \nHowever, summer vacation time between school years is a broader period with more options and less density of people during any singular week. As such, this is a better alternative for scheduling a cruise longer than seven days, or there's always the option to take shorter weekend getaways during the year with minimal time required off school or work.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jason LeppertTravelPulse"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"7 tips for families traveling on cruise for spring break","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Worcester","zipCode":"01615","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Worcester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Telegram.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"599979381","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"26"},"name":"Telegram.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.telegram.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196753338","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Now more than ever, there are tremendous numbers of spice companies and celebrity chefs marketing their unique blends. While it may seem confusing, it's actually good news for the home cook. These blends are perfectly matched and easy to use, most having a sprinkle top built into the container for a shake or two of flavor in a jiffy. \n \nBlends represent regional flavors from all over the world: Tuscany, Provence, the American Southwest and even sunny Spain. Today's recipe uses the sultry and savory flavors of the Southwest, with chilies, cumin and red pepper. I find myself using the Southwest blend of spices in everything from salsas to veggies to seasoning a steak. Once you start to experiment with different spice combinations, you'll learn which companies and mixes you like best. I prefer those blends that are salt-free so I can add my own amount of salt to each recipe. \n \nToday's recipe for Quick Veggie Corncakes is spiked with the zesty spices of the Southwest and is a terrific solution to the wintertime drought in fresh veggies, too. These little cakes are perfect alone or served with salsa and sour cream. Serve them with salad, fish, chicken or even a spicy hamburger. That's just how flexible they are. Grab a blend or two and start experimenting.

This represents the only public, accredited MSW program offered in downtown Worcester. \n \nWestfield State chose Worcester because of the strong demand for an affordable, well-established MSW program to be offered in that city. Developing an affordable and accessible MSW option with a community-focused partner provides a valuable resource for the city, the surrounding area and the commonwealth, according to Tricia M. Oliver, director of campus communication at Westfield State. \n \nClasses are held online or in person at the YWCA, Ms. Oliver said. \n \nApplications for the hybrid program are now being accepted for fall enrollment. \n \nCollege Town asked Ms. Oliver if there is a limit for the number of students. \n \n\u201cEnrollment begins in fall 2017 with an anticipated 16 students. We expect the program to develop over three years to a full capacity of 64 students, graduating 24 annually starting May 2020,\u201d she said. \n \nBased on 2016-17 tuition and fees, the total cost to complete Westfield State\u2019s traditional, three-year MSW program is $27,984 and the part-time, two-year advanced standing program costs $15,688, according to Shelley Tinkham. Westfield State dean of the division of graduate and continuing education.  \n \nAmong the advantages to the partnership with the YWCA is its connections with area social services and heath care organizations and agencies, which will be helpful to enhance students\u2019 learning, Ms. Tinkham said. \n \nThere are some other options in the Worcester area for Central Massachusetts residents pursuing master\u2019s degrees in social work. \n \nSpringfield College School of Social Work began offering graduate level classes at St. Vincent Hospital in Worcester in September 2011, but students may only take four courses at St. Vincent, two in the fall and two in the spring, all on weekends. The remaining courses need to be completed at the Brennan Center on the Springfield College campus. \n \nApproximately 30-35 students are enrolled in the program, according to Damon Markiewicz, associate director for media relations at Springfield College \n \nWheelock College's Wheelock@Worcester offers an MSW program designed for those working for social service agencies, community health or education settings, advocacy organizations or career-changers committed to effecting change in the social conditions and well-being of diverse groups of individuals, children and families. \n \nCourses for the off-campus master of social work program take place at Anna Maria College in Paxton and will continue to be held there through this current spring semester. \n \n\u201cWheelock is currently assessing options and will soon identify a new Worcester location in order to continue offering our human rights and justice based MSW program,\u201d said Alexandra V. Smith, director of communications and media relations for Wheelock College \n \nAnna Maria College recently launched a new master\u2019s in social work program, which is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. Classes will start with the fall semester. \n \nAMC hosts Special Olympics games \n \nThe Anna Maria College Student-Athlete Advisory Committee will host two days of regional basketball games in partnership with the Special Olympics of Massachusetts today and Feb. 12. There will be four games per day, with each game starting on the hour, beginning at noon on both days. \n \nToday, the AMCATS will welcome the COH Ducks, the Auburn Eagles, the Seven Hills Huskies and the Mass. Bandits. The public and the Anna Maria community are also encouraged to attend these free events. There will be music, giveaways, contests and fun for the whole family throughout each day. \n \nDocumentary on Market Basket at Assumption \n \nAssumption College\u2019s MBA program will sponsor a screening of \u201cFood Fight: Inside the Battle for Market Basket\u201d at 7 p.m. Feb. 6 in Kennedy 112 at Assumption College, 500 Salisbury St., Worcester. Tom Bennett, the producer of the movie, will be in attendance to answer questions after the screening. \n \n\"Food Fight\" is the story of the battle to save Market Basket and about the power of ordinary, passionate people to rewrite corporate history. \n \nThe event is free. \n \nHC prof named Regis president \n \nThe Rev. Thomas Worcester, S.J., professor of history at the College of the Holy Cross, will become the 11th president of Regis College, the Jesuit Faculty of Theology at the University of Toronto and one of North America's Roman Catholic ecclesiastical faculties. \n \nHe will begin his five-year term on Aug. 1, prior to the 2017-2018 academic year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"College Town: MSW program offered at Worcester YWCA","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Worcester","zipCode":"01615","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Worcester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Telegram.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"599979381","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"26"},"name":"Telegram.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.telegram.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196754330","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n\nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n\n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n\n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n\n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n\nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n\nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n\nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n\nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n\nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n\nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n\nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n\nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n\nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n\nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n\nReleased under special circumstances \n\nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n\nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n\n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n\nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n\nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n\nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n\nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n\n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n\n'The executive order is unlawful' \n\nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n\nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n\n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n\nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n\n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n\nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n\nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n\n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n\nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n\nLegality questioned \n\nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n\nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n\n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n\nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US.

I'll take the latter, being fonder of soft lights and cozy nooks than I am of more calories, banged-up shins or binge shopping. Not to say they aren't all worthy pursuits. Quite fortunate that I do not have to go anywhere to work. \n \nI don't know who out there shares my fondness for visiting bookstores, near and far. I love the different set-ups inside stores and the pleasant collision of reading materials. Some have sofas and soft chairs, others offer tables and hard chairs. Some have coffee corners (which I love) and cookies. All have an unpredictable collection of literature. You just don't know what you'll find. \n \nOut near Springdale, Utah, the town at the exit to Zion National Park, there's an odd little book joint called the Virgin Goods Book Store (and Community Post Office), where I found a nice collection of literary journals for about 50 cents each. I have to browse quickly, as there is much to do and my companions are always thinking about that, but I always find something good. It's likely that passing tourists on Route 9 stop to trade in their books for something new. \n \nThe beauty of these stops is not just in finding books, but in connecting with local people who can give you tips to restaurants, inns, nearby sites worth checking out. \n \nCloser to home, there are quite a few spots for return visits \u2014 the Barrow Bookstore and the Concord Book Shop (open seven days), both in Concord, bring in local authors and offer signed first editions, books by regional authors and more; Bearly Read Books, Route 20 in Sudbury (closed Mondays), offers rare books as well, meeting space and collections of various genres that may interest your book club, ranging from classics and mysteries to fantasy, history and special interests. \n \nAnother seven-day store is the Book Bear in West Brookfield, which has used, rare and out-of-print books, buys and sells, priding itself on a diverse, ever-changing selection. It's on Route 9. \n \nBooklovers' Gourmet in Webster (open Tuesday-Saturday) offers books, pastries and brews at 55 East Main St., with cozy seating and occasional author visits/signings. A book group and a writers group meet here. Deb Horan aims to provide a literary home here for readers. \n \nTaproot is another interesting place to find an unusual book. Rock collectors will enjoy browsing crystals of all kinds. Open seven days a week, it's a small, somewhat eclectic book and gift shop at 1200 West Boylston St. (Route 12, near O'Connor's), Worcester. Irene Evory and Richard Barca are the owners. Being community-minded, they will match customer donations to several charities: Abby's House, Worcester County Food Bank, the Heifer Project and the Jimmy Fund. \n \nThere's a new store in Marlboro as well, mentioned in the last column: Stax Discount Books, owned by Michael Joachim, is at 193A Boston Post Road (Route 20 West), offering new, discounted books. \n \nTatnuck, on Lyman Street, Westboro, has added a large amount of gift items, but the coffee and sandwich cafe is a good one, and there are easy chairs in the back for Wi-Fi use or reading, with at least half the store dedicated to new books and magazines, often discounted. I still pop in regularly, finding goodies in both sides of the store. \n \nI have not visited the Montague Bookmill in years, and I have it in mind to get there next time I'm in the territory. It's west on Route 2, just before Greenfield. Plan to allocate time for a visit to 440 Greenfield Road. Dubbed: \"Books you don't need, in a place you can't find,\" the bookshop has rooms to explore in an old mill building along a hefty river. There's coffee too. It's an outing by itself, with a nearby arts center. \n \nIf you're out and about, the Toadstool Bookshop in Peterboro, New Hampshire, at 12 Depot Square is a must-visit. With frequent author visits, and new and used book sections, the bookstore is vital and active (toadstool.com). There's a second store in Keene, recently moved to Main and Emerald streets. \n \nOne thing I really like about bookstore visits is the assortment of nice people who work there. There's usually time for a book consult or just a casual bookish conversation about the weather and such. Many provide space for Wi-Fi users to stop awhile and work or entertain themselves. \n \nA number of independents have teamed up with large distributors like Amazon to speed their books to customers by mail, etc., and some operate solely online, but I'm not so interested in that; I like spending some quality time in a new place, soaking up the words and the spirits of the place. \n \nArea book club meetings \n \nCharlton Public Library readers will discuss \"The House Girl\" by Tara Conklin at 6:30 p.m. Feb. 9. \n \nClinton's Bigelow Library continues its Short Story Reading Group at 10 a.m. Feb. 11 and Feb. 25, discussing and reading works by Irish novelist and short-story writer William Trevor.

But, really, who can say what will happen next that TV will feel the need to respond to? \n \nAlready, though, conspiracy-minded fiction like ABC's \"Designated Survivor\" and \"Scandal\" feels less escapist than it did before we were told of Russia's attempts to interfere with a real U.S. election. \n \n\"Homeland,\" which hedged its bets many months ago by writing in a female president-elect (Elizabeth Marvel, \"House of Cards\") who's at odds with the intelligence community, looks smarter than ever. \n \nBut a show doesn't have to be set in the world of politics to be political, or prescient. \n \n\"Outsiders,\" on basic cable's WGN America, is a drama about the Farrells, a large extended family living off the grid atop a mountain in Kentucky whose way of life is threatened when a mining company acquires the land they've occupied for generations. \n \nBelow the mountain sits a town full of out-of-work coal miners and their families, who are as important to the story as the Farrells. \n \n\"The world that we've created, you have a population of basically sort of disenfranchised, unemployed, desperate, rural people who are angry and they need jobs and they need money and they're angry at a group of people that have even less than they do,\" \"Outsiders\" creator Peter Mattei told reporters. \n \n\"These two groups are kind of at war with each other, and at the top of it and kind of benefiting, ultimately, from this (are) \u2026 some corporate billionaires working with the state government. So I think that's a pretty decent metaphor for the whole country right now,\" he said. \n \nThis season, responding to some fatal encounters last season with the Farrells \u2014 led by a character played by David Morse, who looked to be a goner in the season finale \u2014 the authorities' next idea will be to build a very long fence to contain them. \n \n\"We came up with that story point a month before there was ever any talk about a fence going up anywhere else,\" said executive producer Peter Tolan. \n \nMaybe so, but a second-season story line about the crushing cost of illness, even for someone who manages to get access to health insurance, seems particularly timely, illustrating the hopelessness of people who may never see their situations reflected in an episode of \"Grey's Anatomy.\" \n \nHealth-care concerns could also explain one appeal of the Farrells' lifestyle. Their homegrown remedies may not be more effective than modern medicine, but at least the family doesn't have to fight with insurance companies for the right to try them. \n \nMost people we see on television aren't struggling as much as those on \"Outsiders,\" but economic diversity does exist in shows such as ABC's \"The Middle\" and CBS's \"Mom,\" Showtime's \"Shameless,\" and Netflix's new \"One Day at a Time,\" where money's not an abstract concept. \n \nThe third season of ABC's anthology series \"American Crime,\" which premieres March 12, looks to be a deep dive into human trafficking, immigrant labor, and the economics of farming, set in North Carolina. \n \nCreator John Ridley, who explored a racially charged murder in Modesto, California, in the show's first season and the consequences of a sexual assault in its second, set in Indianapolis, didn't need the November election to know there were stories to be told about places far from Hollywood. (\"Shots Fired,\" a forthcoming Fox drama about the aftermath of a fatal police-involved shooting, is also set in North Carolina.) \n \n\"Irrespective of who's in office, I've always wanted to tell stories that had a bit of urgency,\" Ridley said. \"If people look at things through a slightly different lens, based on what's going on, that's not necessarily a bad thing.\" \n \nThere have always been \"electric moments\" in politics, he said. \"But if all we're doing is addressing things that are happening in the moment \u2026 as opposed to addressing the larger infrastructure that seems to have been in place for decades and decades, then I think we're missing the bigger picture, and I think we're missing bigger opportunities.\" \n \nOn the other side of the economic divide, one opportunity television won't be missing in a Trump administration is to tell more stories about billionaires. \n \nThe tech billionaire who's trying to revolutionize medicine in CBS's \"Pure Genius\" will have a counterpart on Fox beginning Feb. 6, when \"APB\" premieres, with Justin Kirk playing a tech billionaire who privatizes a police precinct in Chicago after his best friend is murdered. \n \nShowtime's \"Billions\" got there first. \n \nReturning for a second season Feb. 19, it stars Damian Lewis as Bobby Axelrod, a financial wizard whose disdain for regulation puts him in the crosshairs of U.S. Attorney Chuck Rhoades, played by Paul Giamatti, who also happens to be a producer on \"Outsiders.\" \n \nEven before a billionaire was elected president, \"Billions\" showrunners Brian Koppelman and David Levien say, they were interested in America's fascination with the ultra-moneyed. \n \n\"Why is it that someone on TV, on a reality show, that \u2026 the primary thing they've done is earn a lot of money, and they're charismatic, why do we forgive everything else, as a culture, and celebrate these people?\" Koppelman said. \"We were asking that question a year before the election, and we're asking the question in a more penetrating way in the second season.\" \n \n\"Billions\" \"is not directly about national politics. But what it is about is the kind of person who allows ambition, and the need to dominate, to drive a lot of their behavior. And so the resonances are there,\" he said, adding, \"The show's still funny. We didn't get on a soapbox.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ellen GrayPhiladelphia Daily News"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"TV is there for a divided country","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Worcester","zipCode":"01615","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Worcester","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Telegram.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"599979381","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"26"},"name":"Telegram.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.telegram.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196755805","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It can even be daunting. When you come home from a hard day of wrangling penguins, the last thing you want to do is put together a meal with 27 different ingredients. \n \nSo you reach into the larder (does anyone even have a larder anymore? When's the last time you saw the word \"larder\"?) and pull out a handful of ingredients. No more than five. And you make a meal, or at least a dish. \n \nIt may not be as complexly flavored as the one with 27 ingredients, but on the other hand, there is less to go wrong, too. It's clean. Efficient. Simple. \n \nSimplicity is key. \n \nAnd from such simplicity can come bold flavors. I made a pot roast out of five ingredients, and it is so roundly delectable that I am calling it Five-Ingredient Bourguignon. \n \nThat may be stretching the point, but only a little. I began with a hunk of meat (top or bottom round; I used top) and I braised it until tender in red wine with onions and thyme. \n \nThe key is to cook the meat at a low simmer for a long time (mine took a little under two hours). This not only makes what is typically a tough piece of meat deliciously tender, but it also gives a chance for the acidity in the wine to mellow out as the alcohol cooks away. \n \nIt's a breeze to make, and the result is a hearty roast, just right for a cold winter's night. \n \nFor a side dish to stand up to the beef _ or an excellent vegetarian main course _ you might want to consider White Beans With Rosemary and Garlic. \n \nNaturally, this is a dish of white beans that has been flavored with rosemary and garlic, plus olive oil and salt. But the recipe comes from Alice Waters, who revolutionized American cooking with her world-famous restaurant Chez Panisse, so you know it is going to be extra good. \n \nAnd so it is. Beans, garlic and rosemary combine to bring out an almost unworldly earthiness in each other; it is a truly great grouping of flavors. Waters' recipe calls for soaking beans overnight and then simmering them for a couple of hours, but I took the easy way out and used beans from a can. \n \nIt was superb. I'm sure her way is better, but this was superb. \n \nAnd so was Teriyaki Chicken With Bok Choy, a dish that embarrasses me a little because it breaks an unwritten law. I generally try not to cook with premade or processed ingredients (the \"Semi-Homemade\" way) such as teriyaki sauce. And yet, here is a recipe calling for chicken thighs marinated in bottled teriyaki sauce and garlic, and it was wonderful. \n \nHow could it not be? The people who make bottled teriyaki sauce know what they are doing. It adds just the right sweet-spicy notes to chicken that play beautifully off the mildly bitter taste of the bok choy. Serve it on rice and you have a satisfying, easy meal. \n \nEven faster and easier, though, is Crispy-Coated Lemon-Pepper Salmon. The secret to this is lemon-pepper-flavored panko bread crumbs which, admittedly, is also sort of semi-homemade. \n \nBut they add a snap of lemon and a hint of black pepper to salmon, which goes perfectly with them. And the panko bread crumbs add a bit of texture to it, though maybe not the crunch the name implies. \n \nThe only other ingredients needed are buttermilk and melted butter, both of which help the bread crumbs adhere to the fish. It all takes the salmon, which is already great, and makes it better. \n \nOne of my favorite go-to dinners is sausage, peppers and onions, so I made it, as well. There is just something magical about the way Italian sausage blends with sauteed onion and the natural sweetness of a mild pepper. \n \nWhen I make it, I usually eat it with no embellishments because it needs none. But it's even better when it is sandwiched between two pieces of good crusty bread. I put mine in the middle of a baguette, which brought a new level to an already incredible meal. \n \nAnd all of this could only be topped with dessert. Something simple (simplicity is key). Something elegant. Something blissful. \n \nIn fact, something exactly like Vanilla Pots de Creme, which is to say a light vanilla custard. It's just a gentle combination of milk _ you don't even have to use cream _ sugar, egg yolks and vanilla. Cook until it's thickened, then cook some more in a water bath to regulate the temperature. \n \nIt's so good, so creamy on your tongue, you'll find yourself wondering: How can something this amazing be made from only four ingredients? \n \nFIVE-INGREDIENT BOURGUIGNON \n \nYield: 6 servings \n \n2½ pounds beef, chuck roast, top round or bottom round \n \nSalt \n \n2 cups red wine \n \n½ onion, in lengthwise slices \n \n1 teaspoon dried thyme or 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme \n \nGenerously season beef on all sides with salt. Place meat in Dutch oven or large, heavy-bottomed pot with the wine, onion and thyme. \n \nBring to a boil, cover, lower temperature and cook at a low simmer, turning occasionally, until meat is cooked through, about 1¾ to 2 hours. \n \nPer serving: 725 calories; 46 g fat; 18 g saturated fat; 189 mg cholesterol; 49 g protein; 5 g carbohydrate; 1 g sugar; no fiber; 995 mg sodium, 41 mg calcium.

Separate the eggs. In a medium bowl, whisk the yolks just enough to break them up (reserve the whites for another use). Set a strainer over a different medium heat-proof bowl. Set a kettle of water on the stove to boil. \n \nPour milk and sugar into a heavy-bottomed pot. Slice the piece of vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape the tiny seeds from each side into the milk mixture. Add the pieces of bean to the mixture, and heat the pot on medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. When the milk is hot, whisk a little bit of it at a time into the egg yolks. When you have added ¼ of the milk to the yolks, pour the mixture back into the hot milk. \n \nCook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens just enough to coat the back of a spoon; if you draw your finger across the coating on the spoon you will be able to see the trail it made. Do not let the mixture boil. Remove from the heat and quickly strain into the heatproof bowl. \n \nPour the custard equally into 4 ramekins and set the ramekins in a large baking pan. Place the pan in the oven and fill the pan with the boiling water at least halfway to the level of the custard, taking care not to spill water into the custards. Cook until the sides are set but the center of the custard is still loose and jiggly, about 30 to 45 minutes. Remove the baked custards from the water to cool, then refrigerate. \n \nPer serving: 186 calories; 9 g fat; 4 g saturated fat; 198 mg cholesterol; 10 g protein; 16 g carbohydrate; 16 g sugar; no fiber; 124 mg sodium; 166 mg calcium.

Semon Telegram & Gazette Staff @CraigSemon  \nA country vixen and consummate \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend,\u201d an original \u201cStar Trek\" crew member, a legendary L.A.-funk/modern rock combo, the creative force behind Creedence Clearwater Revival and an \u201cX-Files\" agent undercover as a rock star are some of the acts making the rounds in February. \n \nPlatinum winning streak \n \nMiranda Lambert, Feb. 2, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts Center, Providence, R.I.; Feb. 3, Mullins Center, Boston; and Feb. 4, Mohegan Sun Arena, Uncasville, Conn. \n \nSix albums into her career, it is safe to say that Miranda Lambert is a platinum expert. \n \nAll of her previous albums have gone platinum and her platinum blond locks have done her right. \n \nDespite finishing third on \"Nashville Star\" (country music's \"American Idol\") in 2003 (who was she against, Patsy Cline and Jesus Christ?), Lambert has the distinction of becoming the only artist in the history of Billboard\u2019s country albums chart to debut at No. 1 with all of her first six albums, and she has won seven consecutive Academy of Country Music Female Vocalist of the Year Awards, which is another record. \n \nNot only is she arguably the best young female country artist out there today, Lambert - who practices her right to bear arms and burn bridges, homes, you name it - is quite possibly today's best female rocker. \n \nLambert is expected to continue her platinum-winning streak with her latest chart-topper, \u201cThe Weight of These Wings,\u201d and concert trek, dubbed the \u201cHighway Vagabond Tour.\u201d \n \nThe Needs of the Many Outweigh the Needs of the Few \n \nGeorge Takei Live Plus a Screening of \u201cStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,\u201d Feb. 3, Boch Center Wang Theatre, Boston. \n \nThere\u2019s a new trend popping up in classy theaters and concert halls across the country in the last few years: the screening of a beloved movie accompanied by one of its stars fielding audience\u2019s questions and supplying colorful behind-the-scenes commentary afterwards. \n \nIn the last year or so, we have had John Cleese with \u201cMonty Python and The Holy Grail,\u201d Barry Bostwick with \u201cThe Rocky Horror Picture Show,\u201d Cary Elwes with \u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d (all three at The Hanover Theatre for the Performing Arts in Worcester) and Mel Brooks with \u201cBlazing Saddles.\u201d \n \nThe latest celebrity appearance/film screening pairing is the strangest - George Takei with \u201cStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.\u201d \n \nAs any good Trekkie knows, this is the best \u201cStar Trek\u201d movie in the franchise and worthy to be seen again on the big screen again and again. And Takei (aka Lt. Hikaru Sulu, helmsman of the USS Enterprise) has become the most popular crew member of the original cast in recent years, mainly for his appearances on \u201cThe Howard Stern Show\u201d where he has been very candid (and very funny) about being gay and his lingering hostility to William Shatner (aka Captain James T. Kirk). \n \nWhile it is always great to listen to Takei, Sulu is a very minor character in \u201cThe Wrath of Khan.\u201d Heck, Chekov (Walter Koenig) even has a bigger role in this movie than Takei and has a memorable line to boot (\u201cHe put creatures in our bodies\u201d). \n \nIf they wanted to do this right, Takei should be paired with a screening of Sulu\u2019s proudest moment (and the last great \u201cStar Trek\u201d movie) \u201cStar Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\u201d or even 1968\u2019s \u201cThe Green Berets\u201d opposite \u201cThe Duke.\u201d \n \nBlood Sugar Sex Magik \n \nRed Hot Chili Peppers, Feb. 7 and 8, TD Garden, Boston. \n \nCombining the best elements of rap, funk and rock, Grammy Award-winning, Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Red Hot Chili Peppers are expected to give Bay State fans a complete funk workout when they hit the TD Garden in support of their latest (and seventh Top 10 album over), \u201cThe Getaway.\u201d \n \nWith a combustible mix of roaring guitar chords, crashing drum beats and locomotive bass lines, this LA funk-modern rock combo still erupts into a funk-rock maelstrom that is guaranteed to knock one's strategically placed tube sox off. \n \nIn addition to Josh Klinghoffer (who seamlessly replaced the band\u2019s longtime guitarist John Frusciante), the Red Hot Chili Peppers boast blistering bassist Flea and powder-keg drummer Chad Smith, arguably the best rhythm section in rock. On top of that, singer Anthony Kiedis has never sounded better. \n \nIf past Chili Peppers shows have taught us anything, expect Kiedis to be fast, furious and in your face, while Klinghoffer's stinging guitar licks, Flea's snarling bass lines and Smith's bone-crunching drumbeats laying down the heavy-laden, funk-rock jams with no foreseeable end. \n \nCenterfield \n \nJohn Fogerty, Feb. 16, Grand Theater at Foxwoods, Mashantucket, Conn. \n \nNot since the Vietnam War/Richard Nixon era has our country been so divided. And hopefully, like the turbulent \u201860s before it, we will survive as a nation and have produced some great protest songs. One of the greatest protest songs of the Vietnam Era was \u201cFortunate Son\u201d from Rock and Roll Hall and Creedence Clearwater of Famer John Fogerty. \n \nReleasing a self-titled debut in 1968 and three albums in 1969, Creedence Clearwater Revival became a rock 'n' roll staple before Fogerty disbanded it in 1972 over contract disputes with Fantasy Records, as well as infighting among the band members. While this feud raged for more than three decades, it also made Fogerty stay clear of his classic swamp blues-rock-country-folk boogie that was \"Born on the Bayou.\" \n \nWell, the feud is now over and Fogerty is embracing his rich musical legacy while playing all those great Creedence songs (including \u201cBad Moon Rising,\u201d \u201cDown on the Corner,\u201d \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain,\u201d \u201cProud Mary,\u201d \u201cSuzie Q\u201d and \u201cWho\u2019ll Stop the Rain\u201d) that found a place in the hearts of rock lovers everywhere. \n \nThe Truth Is Out There \n \nDavid Duchovny, Feb. 22, The Wilbur Theatre, Boston. \n \nJoining the ranks of Jeff Bridges, Billy Bob Thornton, Russell Crowe, Johnny Depp, Hugh Laurie, Keanu Reeves and Kiefer Sutherland, David Duchovny is the latest actor who thinks he\u2019s a rock star. \n \nBeloved as Fox Mulder on \u201cThe X-Files\u201d and Hank Moody on \u201cCalifornication (as well as cross-dressing DEA agent Denise Bryson on \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d and hilariously playing himself on \u201cThe Larry Sanders Show\u201d), the New York-born and -bred, Yale-educated, Golden Globe-winning, New York Times Best Selling author is out on the road performing songs from his 2015 debut \u201cHell or Highwater,\u201d along with some brand-new tracks. \n \nWith a sound described as a combination of folk rock and alternative rock with elements of country, Duchovny cites Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Wilco, R.E.M. and the Flaming Lips. \n \nOnly time will tell if this close encounter with Duchovny will be \u201cSpooky\u201d (in a bad way) or out of this world. \n \nAnd the rest for February are: \n \nLeon, Feb. 1, The Sinclair, Cambridge. \n \nAaron Lewis, Feb. 3, House of Blues, Boston. \n \nMaren Morris, Feb. 3, The Paradise Rock Club, Boston. \n \nWhiskey Myers, Feb. 4, Brighton Music Hall, Allston. \n \nmoe., Feb. 4, Calvin Theater, Northampton. \n \nAfi, Feb. 4, The Paradise Rock Club. \n \nAlter Bridge, Feb. 7, House of Blues. \n \nOnes to Watch presents Locash \u2013 The Fighters, Feb. 8, House of Blues. \n \nHamilton Leithausen, Feb. 8, The Sinclair. \n \nDrive By Truckers, Feb. 9, Royale, Boston. \n \nMarc Anthony, Feb. 10, Agganis Arena, Boston. \n \nCode Orange, Feb. 10, The Palladium, Worcester. \n \nEugene Mirman, Feb. 11, The Paradise Rock Club. \n \nWilliam Singe, Feb. 11, Royale. \n \nDe Mayimbe a Mayimbe, Feb. 11, Lynn Memorial Auditorium, Lynn. \n \nPaula Cole, Feb. 11, Narrows Center for the Arts, Fall River. \n \nSteve Aoki, Feb. 11, The Palladium. \n \nI Prevail, Feb. 13, Brighton Music Hall. \n \nJake Miller, Feb. 14, House of Blues. \n \nUs the Duo, Feb. 15, The Paradise Rock Club. \n \nLess Than Jake and Pepper, Feb. 16, House of Blues. \n \nThe Cadillac Three, Feb. 16, The Paradise Rock Club. \n \nRascal Flatts, Feb. 17, Grand Theater at Foxwoods. \n \nCherub and The Floozies, Feb. 17, House of Blues. \n \nJa Rule, Feb. 17, The Fox Theater, Mashantucket, Conn. \n \nDevildriver, Feb. 17, The Palladium. \n \nTchami, Feb. 17, Royale. \n \nAriana Grande, Feb. 17, Mohegan Sun Arena. \n \nSafety Suit, Feb. 17, The Paradise Rock Club. \n \nRick Astley, Feb. 18, House of Blues. \n \nFrank Turner & The Sleeping Soul, Feb. 18, Agganis Arena. \n \nLordi, Feb. 18, The Palladium. \n \nBoom Box, Feb. 18, The Paradise Rock Club. \n \nTove Lo, Feb. 19, House of Blues. \n \nDaya, Feb. 19, The Paradise Rock Club. \n \nJapandroids, Feb. 20, Royale. \n \nJosh Garrels and John Mark McMillian, Feb. 21, The Wilbur. \n \nDita Von Tease, Feb. 21, House of Blues. \n \nWhitechapel, Feb. 22, Brighton Music Hall. \n \nBeth Hart, Feb. 23, The Wilbur. \n \nLauryn Hill, Feb. 23, Boch Center Wang Theatre. \n \nTribal Seeds, Feb. 23, House of Blues. \n \nRun the Jewels, Feb. 23, House of Blues. \n \nSilent Planet, Feb. 23, The Palladium. \n \nPanic!

While just a year ago, it seemed as though the legalized, regulated network of online casinos was going to extend to states other than New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware, things are a bit different now. \n\nAccording to BestUSCasinos.org, New Jersey's online casino network is in a state of jeopardy. The report highlights that the newly appointed United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions has a history of speaking negatively with regard to legal online casinos. It went on to say that Sessions has already alluded to the fact that he will revisit a more than 5-year-old resolution that allows for online gambling to exist in individual states. The law the article referenced was changed back in 2011, but can just as easily be reverted; something that would almost immediately bring an end to any and all legalized online gambling. \n\nTo many people, the US real money casino industry (see Bestuscasinos.org/real-money/) was growing and had a promising future, but this report out of New Jersey has folks thinking that, perhaps, the opposite is true. Arguing that a change in the law would mean for a massive hit to state revenues, they are hoping that Sessions and his colleagues have better things to worry about. With all of this being said, the future is uncertain for states that were just beginning to gain momentum on the legalized online gambling front. \n\nFinally, the report went on to talk about the impact Donald Trump could potentially have on New Jersey and other states. At this juncture, it is uncertain whether Trump will get behind the idea of regulated and legalized online casinos, or if he will be an opponent�showing favor only to brick and mortar establishments. This would not be something new, as brick and mortar casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has worked fervently to keep online gambling illegal in states like California. If Trump proves to be the same type of real money casino opponent, it may be a long 4+ years for gamblers and casino operators alike. \n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-jersey-online-casinos-could-be-in-jeopardy-says-bestuscasinosorg-300398438.html","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Gaming news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Media latest","group":"Media"},{"name":"Online gambling news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"}],"title":"New Jersey Online Casinos Could Be In Jeopardy, Says BestUSCasinos.org","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Digital Media Net","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169726573","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Digital Media Net","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional","Media","Wires","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://digitalmedianet.com","publisher":"Digital Media Online"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-jersey-online-casinos-could-be-in-jeopardy-says-bestuscasinosorg-300398438.html"],"sequenceId":"695196763931","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

North Lincolnshire on this week in the past? \n \nOr if not, can you remember some of the stories which were hitting the headlines in the Scunthorpe Telegraph? \n \nHere, we take a look back at some of the things which were happening in the Scunthorpe area this time last year, 10 years ago and in 2003. \n One year ago  \nThis time last year, plans were announced to transform North Lincolnshire Council's Civic Centre headquarters in Scunthorpe into a hotel or new homes. \n \n\n \nThe proposal was revealed by the council to the Scunthorpe Telegraph as part of plans to relocate its offices to Church Square, in the town centre. \n \nAlso in January 2016, plans to turn the A15 between Scunthorpe and Lincoln into a dual carriageway were said to have taken a step forward. \n \nIt was announced that a detailed study was to be carried out to assess the economic benefit for the region which could come from a dualling of the major road. \n \nTelevision viewers in the region were gearing up to watch North Lincolnshire quiz queen Isabelle Heward appear on ITV programme The Chase. \n \n\n \nIsabelle, who has also been on Mastermind, The Weakest Link, Countdown, Film Buff of the Year and various radio quizzes, spoke to the Telegraph ahead of taking on the chaser in the daytime show. \n\n \nAnd there was also a look back at the day Scunthorpe was bombed by a large German Zeppelin airship in the week of the 100th anniversary of the raid. \n \n\n \nThree people were killed by bombs dropped during the First World War raid, which saw the Zeppelin stay in the skies over the town for eight-and-a-half minutes and drop 20 high-explosive devices. \n 10 years ago  \nOn this week in 2007, the Telegraph reported on a spate of car crime where dozens of vehicles were broken into or stolen over four days. \n \nThe front-page story said around 40 vehicles were targeted, with 30 broken into and attempts made to steal another 10. \n \n\n\n \nAlso that week, it was reported that plans for the then-empty Baths Hall venue included turning it into a hotel. \n \nFive bids to replace the Doncaster Road venue were shortlisted by North Lincolnshire Council, although The Baths Hall was eventually transformed into a modern venue which opened in 2011. \n \n\n \nIn what was believed to be a first for any local authority in the country, North Lincolnshire Council announced school staff were to give extra advice to combat the rising problem of cyber-bullying. \n \nThe approach to the problem came after videos were discovered online showing school pupils from the area fighting. \n \n\n \nAnd the Telegraph also reported on a book sale with a difference, as hundreds of books and CDs were sold for as little as 30p each at North Lincolnshire Central Library. \n \nA huge amount of books were on offer at the cut-price sale, which attracted hordes of people. \n \n\n 14 years ago  \nIn 2003, a groundbreaking application was to go before licensing magistrates to extend pub opening hours earlier in the morning. \n \nThe JD Wetherspoon chain was set to ask for permission to serve alcohol at its Blue Bell pub in Scunthorpe from 10am. \n \nAnd it was reported that the move could allow every pub in North Lincolnshire to start pulling pints an hour earlier. \n \n\n \nAlso that week, the gauntlet was thrown down to celebrity chef Jamie Oliver by North Lincolnshire Council to sample a school meal. \n \nJamie branded school dinners \"cheap and rubbish\" in an interview with the BBC Good Food magazine. \n \nBut Councillor Tony Gosling challenged the man known as The Naked Chef to have a meal in one of North Lincolnshire's schools and then see if he stood by his comments. \n \n\n \nThe Telegraph also reported on the story of an epic flight across the North Sea by a balloon released in Scunthorpe. \n \nThe balloon was one of 111 let go to mark the opening of the Kingsway Children's Centre. \n \nAnd amazingly, it travelled all the way to Norway and remained intact until it was caught by two children in the town of Valen. \n \n\n \nAnd as Scunthorpe United's Division Three promotion push continued, it was one of their young players who caught the eye in a 4-1 home victory over Southend United. \n \nThat man was 19-year-old striker Paul Hayes, who came off the bench to score one of the goals. \n \nHayes went on to be one of United's key men in two spells with the club, the second of which saw him play a part in the Iron earning promotion to the Championship in 2009. \n \n\n \nRead today's top stories \n\n \n\n Follow us

Letaba Rest Camp \n \nLetaba Rest Camp is situated on the bend of the Letaba River. The camp is midway between the southern and northern boundaries, reports the  Lowvelder . \n \nThe name means \u201criver of sand\u201d. The riverbed is an excellent location for game viewing, particularly elephant. \n \n\n \n2. Orpen Rest Camp \n \nOrpen Rest Camp is situated on the western border of the KNP. It derived its name from the surname of the donor of the land, Eileen Orpen. \n \nIt is an area of scattered trees and wide-open plains populated by the three big cats. You can also look forward to encounters with wild dog. \n \n3. Talamati Bushveld Camp \n \nTalamati Bushveld Camp is situated in a large open valley. Talamati is a Xitsonga word that means \u201clots of water\u201d. \n \nDespite the meaning of the name, the river is actually dry. The clay soil acts as a giant sponge holding a vast reservoir of underground water. The vegetation there is lush all year round and attracts grazers. \n \n4. Sirheni Bushveld Camp \n \nSirheni Bushveld Camp nestles on the edge of the KNP\u2019s northern plains. \n \nThe Mphongolo River flows close by. Sirheni is a Tsonga word that means \u201ccemetery\u201d. There is an elephant graveyard at a site near to the camp. From the camp\u2019s bird hides a wide variety of game and birds can be watched. \n \n\n \n5. Skukuza \n \nSkukuza is a Shangaan word meaning either \u201che who sweeps clean\u201d or \u201che who turns everything upside down\u201d. It is the biggest camp in the park. \n \nSome Krugerholics even call Skukuza the \u201ccapital\u201d of the Republic of Kruger! \n \nIt is close to the Kruger Gate and an excellent springboard to the rest of the Park. \n \n\n \n6. Punda Maria \n \nThe name of the Punda Maria rest camp was given in 1919 by the first ranger to be posted to the area, Captain JJ Coetser. \n \nHe mistakenly named his post Punda Maria in the belief that this was the Swahili name for zebra, the first big game he saw on arrival. \n \nThe correct Swahili name is actually \u201cpunda milia\u201d or striped donkey. When the error was pointed out to him, he chose to retain the name, in honour of his wife, Maria. \n \nDr. Salomon Joubert said that in 1959, the Parks Board changed the name to Punda Miliya. \n \nDr. Van Warmelo, a well-known ethnomologist, said that the name should be spelt Punda Milia and the board accepted that. \n \nIn 1981 Dr. Tol Pienaar did a submission to the board and two acquaintances of Coetzer Hewit Ivy and Astley Maberley said that this is the correct version of how it came about. \n \nThe board accepted the explanation and the name was restored in 1981. \n \n\n \n\u2013  Caxton News Service \n \nRead original story on lowvelder.co.za","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"This is how these six Kruger camps got their names","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Letaba Herald.co.za","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"533591287","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"28"},"name":"Letaba Herald.co.za","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://letabaherald.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196765671","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Despite being begged to do so, it also failed to send a grader to allow firefighters access to the Hamabuya farm nor to get aerial support to combat the fire. \n \nThis was despite the Letaba Fire Protection Association having a spotter plane and helicopter on standby and a Working on Fire team being on standby. \n \nMopani insisted it could not call for aerial support because it was not a member of the Fire Protection Association, but the chairperson of the Letaba Fire Protection Association, Trevor Phillips, testified the municipality had been asked in vain many times to become a member. \n \nHe said Mopani was entitled to request aerial support if it wished to do so. \n \nJudge Fourie ruled that Mopani had a legal duty to have taken positive measures by calling for aerial support before the fire became uncontrollable. \n \n\u2013 Caxton News Service \n \nRead original story on citizen.co.za","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"\u2018Negligent\u2019 Mopani municipality to pay for timber farm blaze","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Letaba Herald.co.za","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"533591287","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"28"},"name":"Letaba Herald.co.za","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://letabaherald.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196765909","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In some states, insuring a vehicle can be cheaper than in others. Since auto insurance has to be bought from the state in which the driver's' license has been issued, clients do not have much of a choice in this respect. They would have to suffer the positive or negative consequences of their respective state laws. \n\nWhen comparing car insurance plans, clients will notice some differences in the rates they give. Some agencies will rate an area better or worse than others provider, however, living in a bad neighborhood will always make auto insurance costs more. \n\nClients are able to get auto insurance quotes from http://autocarsinsurancetips.com/. To get a list of offers, they have to complete two simple steps: \n\nEnter the ZIP code. Clients will have to enter their ZIP codes in the box found on the website's homepage. The ZIP code will tell brokers where to look for offers and location also plays an important role in determining coverage prices. Auto insurance is cheaper in some states than in others. \n\nComplete the online form. The website collects data that it passes on to brokers who, based on the way in which someone completed the online form will select quotes and determine accurate prices for each customer. \n\nClients who compare car insurance quotes will be able to save more on coverage. Brokers estimate that comparing auto insurance quotes helps drivers reduce their premiums by more than 25%. This is a big percentage and can amount to a high sum, which is saved each year. \n\n\"Your neighborhood can have a big impact on auto insurance prices. Comparing car insurance quotes is always advantageous. Visit us and find the best deals in your area. \" said Russell Rabichev, Marketing Director of Internet Marketing Company. \n\nAutocarsinsurancetips.com is an online provider of life, home, health, and auto insurance quotes.

About them all. He put guard. Twin forces and the new England sports continues so yeah. The card is. Network. I've final hour of the show on it till 6 o'clock. Leading you into Saturday's stage and net. There is some news I guess Bruins related I didn't put in the trendy now I did so to mention it. While I read it on Twitter during the last dollar song gimme again right now Steve Conroy the Boston Harold. Is reporting that Brad marsh and has pulled out of the fastest skater competition. I is believed to be nurse and some sort of lower body injury but mushy and will compete. In knee line shooting competition. Not social arm and be watching this bank and I blood. If you're gonna pull out Brad mosh and from me are people sell pot of the fastest skater competition men. I'm fine if he is to present some Bible lower body injury I would actually just hope that he didn't even lace them up. I know there are a lot of people boss and that like to see their play is. And and the they'd guys in this town represented team on that stage with those are all stars I understand but if you have some type injury. What's about to happen the next couple months this organization is a lot more important than what's gonna happen tonight and tomorrow and Los Angeles itself. Brad my share lower body injury. He will not be in the fastest skater competition he was. Originally scheduled to be but I he will be taken pot and some of the other stuff going on tonight. An NHL all star skills competition but back to football back to Super Bowl 51. I'm taking your phone calls up until 6 o'clock 61777979837. Let's go to Dave down McCain puts update. It would go on daily ya I wanna get it what you suitable opt in July up. I mean that's going to be to keep its air Brees talked about the patriot defense personally let our pets I think it's completely opposite. How that line could hold up against it deep sense of what to reaches opposite it was good dictate. How did defense played the game with a simple bolt they lost they gave up. Seventeen and 21. Didn't come to the table I'm saying at the author it comes to the table Bree gets protected. I mean I'm not saying the blow all acts you can win by ten. And I'll look at. That's why when Houston came and everybody was talking off. I thought that was a good thing to my dog that looked across playoff schemes that would the past deep and so what from the port yeah. Wanting to skip the ball. He'd ended its role atop the giants Seattle banged up but I would look at that deep threats against the soft it's. You know what Seattle has banged up. Invention called Dave I I I still. I still don't wanna see Seattle and the Super Bowl not that I would be shouldn't have pick and Seattle to win that game over the patriots if they did advanced. Additional bowl. But you know that's not a defense to a defense that I didn't wanna see. They still have big time plays on that defense that Nellie did do some things dramatically in May begin Brady fades but to your original point. When you look back at previous super. Bowls and the games that may be Tom Brady . You know was having some issues moving the ball on the field it was because there are guys in his face all night long and it's obvious how do you prevent that Waltz the guys up front. And I think it's obvious that the blueprint that we should call it to be competitive. Against the patriots in a playoff game aren't Super Bowl is to get their quarterback to get to Tom Britt. Now when you look at what Atlanta's done in the last two games they've been able to. Now meg quarterbacks run around. In Russell Wilson Aaron Rodgers granted that I enjoy running around shall. But I think they had to do it a little bit more at least in the first half and those two games than they would've liked. And I think that's a credit. It would let you have to give some credit toward Atlanta's been able to do defensively the last two games or idea as much as I should -- knock on and knocked him and Atlanta's defense a shot this one. You do have to acknowledge what they were able to do against Seattle against green very. But I think you also need to look at the offensive line is that we're going up against Seattle's offensive line very well documented. They had major issues all season long Green Bay from the get called it offensive line injuries right. And also the fact that it was an Atlanta it's just committee what the patriots offensive line what they've been able to do once again. Being healthy and having Dante Scarnecchia Iran on the show without offensive line. They have obviously given Brady. The type of protection that he needs it really get a quarterback needs to have success at this level but there are a lot of quarterbacks that even where it. Protection in the pocket still. Cannot be elite still can not. I guess whether this on the losing their best receiver lose in the one of the best tight ends in the game Tom Brady can't because they do have other weapons okay. And at. I just feel like if the patriots offensive line. And look like it's look like most of this season the point where we're not talking about on the date of the super ball and guess what. The patrons are gonna put up at least 35 points against this falcons defense that statistically. Is one of the worst pass defense is all of football they lost their best cornerback couple weeks to go and troop thought he had surgery. I want about a month ago and not I just think the pitchers are gonna do some things. To prevent. The falcons they got some big bodies that had some speed up front I get that I sought at the last two weeks. What did guy at this point you gotta believe and what the patriots have done would help the offensive line. For the most spot to be able to prevent the other team from get to Tom Brady now that Houston and at the last couple called talked about. Early on at least the first pass to Damian cloudy look like he had his way. But that should dating club I mean I've guys a physical beast you can give me that the sack numbers in the post season all you law. But there isn't anybody on that Atlanta Falcons . Defects that is this theory as to Davy club does not bode record try to give convincing interests because that's the does away so all. Look I I just don't I don't think Atlanta's defense has what it takes to be able to give Tom Brady . The type of fit that you need to give him. The basically be competitive and this one I I just I think Matt Ryan's gonna have to basically be perfect to keep up or break. And that's remaining you get into prison pitcher's defense I would think that bill Belichick's product yet they get two weeks to prepare for Matt Ryan. And they gonna do shop and they've got a coach summed it up early on this game whether it's a Logan Ryan blitzed. You know coming from the backside. All what are its mix in some things up with the linebackers. Now create some confusion up front and it got to do something like that. To force Matt Ryan to get the happy feet could throw a couple bad balls and a and a shoot the ball plays he's never bad to make some bad decisions. And then Brady just gonna take advantage of a pass defense that I just don't think he's going to be able to stop and that's why I think that's polishing distinct plan out. And that's how I see the patriots win and and win big 617. 77979837. Let's go to Sean in Foxborough what's up John. Hey are you don't put out good what's going. The guy you know the craps and bill which just you know years ahead of the league. So why not consider. Trading grew up below an equal rock economical source a couple Shaq around here's. And whatever else changed we might throw in because we've proved we can win without doubt. I think the trading Barack apple always completely on the table. Ideas ideas. And you tossing Glock because we showed. We can win without them and then we can't count didn't really quite a course gonna happen replaced Brady. But if we get you know on number four as far as Tek was somebody coming up the line. If Belichick knows who's coming out of high school who's gonna beat that number one pick entry or. Well let me ask you is if you're gonna UPS and you want to trade garrote below and on talent right now I think that's gonna be on the table next year's the last year of his deal at a fund telecheck. Why nobody is a manic poignant if you'll want to trade Rob Lowe which I'm I'm one bullet went right out and stick or Brady the next couple years. Then why wouldn't you keep Prague and like rocket pack on the field to play the Brady I don't understand why you would want that. Because we've proven we can win in willow both of them and we can prove that change. Quite a scene at this he's thirty years down malign. Jonathan's grandson still being an app the pop. That's how he thinks nobody else thinks that way. I just think you'll improve as a football team we've got a trigger drop along thanks for the call you got to improve as a football team next to abide to ground back and get them healthy. I mean that's the way I'll look at the ground situation. Morgan Hamm would not be as imminent as movement some like a drop well. In my opinion based on the contracts. But I just if you're gonna. Tell yourself as an organization OK you moving broccoli gonna stick a brave for as long as he can stick this out in his career and play at a high level. Which I still think is another three years after this. Then net Y or June. And moved rock why Richard considerable program I just. I don't think that makes much sense you say well they can win without a are fun but don't try to tell me that when they have ground cannot about a team they are about a team. With Brooke on the field. This would probably be the best here to move on from Bronx though because the tight and debts coming out of colleges some of the best we've seen. So this should be. Yeah it's a move. I mean it's not it's not obviously they're not better than Graf but the they haven't had this this high levels tied. I was young Shane Yost and the patriots would then draft and a tight net. Well the when you said that the first thing I think of his will not. No nobody would do that because they see so many good tot young tight ends in the draft they'll keep depiction and wrapped tight end. Who maybe isn't coming off of serious back surgery and not his first surgery self. I mean if you audible grunt. Now I'll get them back. Then she began to fall season. Maybe trip what is healthy. But did that treated rock as it's not a migrate and so easy it's just not. Drop only is because if on Belichick obstacle Brady and moving forward. Bad new girl Rob Lowe has trade value it's a quarterback league. Roll call is going to be out there available you can create some type of quarterback bidding war on the trade market I think it appeared team that's what I'm for quarterback. Woody wants 125 point six rather than someone and we're almost going to be like 3637. I mean. Committee the patriots could get some pretty damn good for grapple this offseason. That is. I'd make more imminent if you're gonna use the word limited that's more imminent than them over gras pummeled on the ground right now. I'm trying to get ground in the field next year so that he can improve this offensive attack ads go to win the patriot to shoot the ball on some. Excitement. I imagine what it would be brought imagine what this would be abroad was helping. Pick up that. People be saying that we didn't play. But again it grounds out the shot. I had. Excellent 7779. 79837. Let's go to. Aden in east Milton went up Aden. Hey guys first Paul are timeless no well push at all. I don't have a quick sitting near me out. You think Roger Goodell just goes so hopeful Paula called dispute that not social. Other I would say that's not gonna happen. Aden I mean that would be. That would be absolutely hysterical. If Goodell said well I'm under the brawl ball and an. Menace and someone else to use them not mean that that's not Mel skull that week and I got to see this that we candidate consumable. I'd be an additional bubble in on demand my. I've done this Schobel. Is it's my advice. Don't need to be at the show global. Imagine. I mean that's that happened we do know is going to be at the suitable could Dell's going to be this with the Lombardi trophy on that stage there's going to be confetti Vaughn from. Adult. At an IG stadium and somebody is going to be accepted that a body trophy somebody's going to be except that Super Bowl MVP. At. I'm expecting Roger Goodell to be the guy to. Hand it off. A Richards. That's an unexpected. Shall. However plays out. I ID card could l.s going to be in his patronage job at the pro is even go to the Pro Bowl. Watch I watch them for. I'm not a I got I saw them I sort of highlight. All of them play and dodge ball. Yesterday. And I'm just like. What's happened. Why. Why the plane door. You don't want to do other things. That is what clip of Ezekiel Elliott you run as easily celebrating a dog bowl victory he runs. He's got no equipment on obviously and his knowledge grass. And each slice on the grass that you know if you're a soccer player and your school it's a wet grass and you slide and you these. She's got a huge Ezekiel Elliott did one of those slides attempt it. And he didn't slide and he like stopped short and came and like fellow vote. Round pick myself if that was my star running back. If all the cowboys fan and I see him doing that after a dodge ball game at the Pro Bowl. I remember the whole Robin Edwards situation in me flag football in the sand. That's devastating stuff that's stuff can happen. Which is. I don't plane flight on their plane on the plane and draw people. Together. I got to me why the white dodge ball again. They did make sure all. You couldn't if I was at a health plan. And I guess I say it's there for guys like Ezekiel LEI shop or go back and Julia. Around and around no pay like if I was one of those guys. You've got to think they are competitive obviously and I am. I lose. The playoffs. And a couple weeks lady wanted to go play dodge ball against other NFL player is no events like what we've put it's so good about that. An edge can do it's like you're watching it for that reason I can't watch it I won't want to Pro Bowl tomorrow night so I don't know Goodell would be at the trouble. Really don't buy from. What I do always good Dell will be at the suitable. And I didn't mean I'm not one of these guys that told I needed good Dallas Foxboro. I don't need developed Foxboro doesn't really do when he thinks of me would be funny yeah. He would get booty would get taunted but let's be honest he'd be able to sneak in the back door he be the media if you haven't. And at a home I think more the media can get into the media and for instead there's ways to get into Gillette. Two gold to security good Dell would go and net and he wouldn't come to any fans. Like it wouldn't it not been bad would happen norm. Good on that I didn't need this to develop Foxboro. I'd president of the patrons extra motivation. When he's there when he's not there. President and if you do would would begin. Shock I didn't meet him there last week if you want to go to Atlanta two weeks or go to Atlanta reached tomorrow you won't. You wanna kiss the Georgia Dome goodbye kiss that George is owned by Alcan. Com put it got beyond that podium. To handle somebody trophy off the patriots. And that will be. The perfect ending to what she's in that again. As mind boggling and as it could begin with a superstar player in this league and the greatest quarterback of all time being suspended. Because it was more probable than not. But the air pressure and the patriots football is an AFC championship game a couple years ago and the first half. Well below hole. The twelve point five PS I'm level that it says in the rule book that previous to that. Sting operation body NFL no there there wasn't one person in the league including the officials that even know ought to fit about the aside. Level in a football it is sure it was the stupidest thing of all time it gets me even what this stop even talking about it. But that's where this season again. And the perfect way for the season to end it. Is. A good Dell to hand that on body. Trophy off to the New England Patriots . Will be handed off Goodell will be I think that's that's a guarantee. We'll patriots beat I mean. I'm verdict that they will I'm verdict and the patrons will be NF podium celebrating a championship. And I think they'll do it handily I think they are gonna pop up out of Brady's gonna come up Atlanta's defense. And patent and Matt Ryan will not be able to keep up against the Patriots defense that to me it's still doesn't get enough credit credit after that especially. Beaten Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown. Last week so I got the patriots went and I have the patriots won a big and I have the perfect moment with good Dell. And graduate and Tom Brady Bill Belichick Eric Robert Kraft and the New England Patriots and it will be is something else that scene. It'll be something else. And they'll be the perfect ending to this whole deflate Kate nonsense 617779798376177797. 937. Back after this time I'll. The weekend new England sports conversation continues with the Danny put cards right now. I want Sports Radio. 61777979837. I'm here till 6 o'clock taking your phone calls on patriots falcons Super Bowl 51 big game a week from tomorrow. Coming up at six Saturday skate. I assume they'll be talking about the fact that in these celebrity gam. Just saw this on to what they do give don't know little celebrity hockey Gammon LA. And net Justin Bieber is wearing a full cage can't Wear full change. Enacting especially enacting a very mica of your encore men's lankans. Sticks just like it or and I yeah I guess it's either. The celebrity. A full pay job. I I assume they'll be talking about that Saturday's game but also they'll be talking about the state of the Bruins here at the NHL all star break. So what in all seriousness you know you look at. What the Bruins have been able to do this season and some controversies. And hot rumors that have been out there and close Giuliani's name once again. It seems like. Every. Yeah. This timing here is a conversation has been had about close Julian future as the Bruins coach. Will he be able to survive this one. I'm I'm not so sure. But you know my thoughts on that. And that is. If you've got to get critical load. You better do it after the season if they don't make the playoffs for a third straight era I don't I don't think you do it right now I did you see what can happen in the second half. And I think he obviously you don't like the playoffs. For Tina does make the last three straight isn't it you can justify coaching change but right now I would do it. But the state of the Bruins a delegate and that on Saturday skate coming up at 6 o'clock. Right now on talking about the state of the patriots the state of the falcons the state of the Super Bowl Super Bowl 51 and years that. A week from tomorrow let's go to scooter and Pittsburgh. Let's us go to. No extra automate a column. It's great it was great right out of Pittsburgh Barbara but I lived up and comic caper eighteen years old. Quality guys tight. You know I think I love the most and all week about Al Brady carved up the Steelers defense and I really don't think he caught that up. You literally didn't play defense. I'm terrorist or nobody within ten yards a receiver that entire game and you're up what bodies and I would watch and I came. We thought the second half they were double come out there are different because it's a game plan. Which they didn't I don't know they went and took about an app I'm. What they did. But VoIP and it concerns me about the collapse and I can't wait to watch his game because they're really not the patch when this game. I hope radiant and and belt checker on a pedestal adult. And I hope they give at all. I notably general matter take the trophy and shaking hands. What I think people inside they're gonna know what they're really feel an Arctic adult in the same way the only thing my my point is. I think the only thing is that. What scares me a little about this game and I think. Even know you look at points allowed with Atlanta's defense I think they play a little cutter approach on these fronts what they're saying he's never beat back which is deal or did not. On I think I think basically if you just like my game plan for the Steelers opponent last week. Which just click on them out of the game I don't meet physically I just mean take you know you don't get an awful lot in the fog or chalk this well the play action. Do all that stop you might have been okay but they didn't do anything. Yeah did they also Pittsburgh Pittsburgh had to get to Brady and I didn't and it's like from the deck all I saw them a couple times. You know there Russian three and I'm just like that's gonna get you'll win at Gillette Stadium you're gonna get down and learning that Brady's face and I just couldn't don't. You know I got no excuses dealt an ugly game I don't know where my steel as well I don't know I don't even know that was a treatment showed up. Where you actually believe in yup Pittsburgh defense thrown in that team Reinemund. I don't know I I did not only I believed. I could not believe in the back field. I believe they're not offensive line which I consider one of about Scotland to London and up now I believed them to be able to score more than. What are they scored. Eighteen points. Seventeen and and again and I don't got no excuses with audio and go on elementary is. I would I would pull away DeAngelo Williams and all day long he'd get a black jury proved that he's just not just that good but he's he's good enough. You know what the way DeAngelo and I said this man did and gave the Angela lions a first couple times after eleven on bill one out I said. The way he bust through that hole on pick myself while this might be a bad thing for the patriots. He has already backe proved last year could everyone was scared one was bowed out last jerk do well to go right back. I was about backup running back in the NFL but anyway Belichick well I appreciate it go that. I want what you hear realistic about the Steelers I'm curious your take on. Ben Roethlisberger he's not really gonna call it quits. It or not their power away and health and you know what happened excuse my language you know what happened that. Sunday night after that football game might come out of compassion on the radio. Uttered dug about what is made up. Antonio Brown was taken about a bunch of on the radio. And you know what they did. Qatar is really the Tuesday's news conference with Bennett a lot of men and then bow and then not prominent twelve. On Coke and pony show here on my victory seven to print expert. All of band did I swear to god can be actually like. Because they're talking about it as prominent Hollywood and that seemed to deepen in the adjustments are out on and I swear to god. I think that those two guys had a cup of coffee in the morning in the clubhouse on the south side of Pittsburgh. And they talk to each other how we gonna defend this. And then ask a simple question. And Bennett said I'm not sure I need a lot for the next two or three days nobody talked about that football game they all talked about and retire. So Ali do it. I doubt guys are called league all I don't I don't. Believe that big bands it's irony that. That's an interesting theory I'd nobody was talking about that game they were talking about all of these the game at Steele is that they were talking about. Roethlisberger and his future he's knock advertise. I just don't see it at Rutgers berg is a guy who plays through everything. Is a guy who plays there is much stop. And much injuries and pain as he does. I called him a psychopath earlier in the season based on how quickly he retired from that torn meniscus. And the surgery that he had and he only missed one game. Because a bye week soul. I mean. When it comes to play an engine plane banged up and battle and throw Ben Roethlisberger is sort of is a psychopath with that at. You have that type of mindset plans are bad stuff you're gonna call it quits I just don't see it. I don't see I don't know if it's exactly the spirit at the last colleges said but. That makes a little bit more sense than Big Ben Roethlisberger having a press conference actually tell us that he's retired I do not see. That being the case whatsoever ball when it comes to Pittsburgh and their defense last week on and I tried Kellan it'll end. They in Pittsburgh does not have the defense of personnel. To be able to stop the Patriots offense at Gillette Stadium I just didn't believe it to be true. And net and it turned out that they didn't have the personnel to be able to stop the patriots and whatever you all metal plant a defense of scheme or plan just didn't work out. And mom. You know the one thing that I thought they needed to do was to get that quarterback they could do and it didn't know that they would have no chance and had no chance. And now I'll save a similar thing about Atlanta. Those guys up front if they can get the Brady then don't lay this scam a week from tomorrow a little bit more interesting. But they have to do that in order for up Matt Ryan. To be able to give his high pollen offense that shot. You'd they have a great offense you know van Matt Ryan's. Wide receivers. Our dad is you know you talk about should know the way that you should know those of those big guys who Leo Jones and those are big guys. You're talking about that you got a little guy Gabriel ran around Denny got a two headed monster in the backfield you know his stock to put it altogether alike that you can get an extra week to pick about it. Yeah gonna get some people talk themselves into Atlanta beaming unstoppable team. Because her offense is so damn good. You're gonna get that a lot of people pick in the falcons to win this game. People expect you sure they'll say this is Matt Ryan Jim they'll tell you that there are just one too many weapons. Offensively for the falcons they will not be stopped. By. I just think if there is any defense image got to slow them down that's elegant completely stop them but to slow them down. I think it's going to be the patriots defense and know when it comes to what Tom Brady's thrown up against. I mean that the weapons that he has the weapons that he's working with and you talk about two headed monsters in the backfield. Art. As an intuit does credit to edit my. Through the playoffs Yang had Dion Lewis had a big game against Houston. And he wasn't great against Pittsburgh and Tom Brady was moving the football me it was a Chris holding him against the Steelers. There wasn't as did hasn't been really that you headed monster attack out of the backfield for the patriots in the post season. But if need be they can go that route and they can have success. Rick that route so the patriots have so many options offensively that against this. What I call. Porous Atlanta Falcons defense. It's going to be Matt Ryan with the pressure on him to keep up with robbery. And the only way he'll be able to do data talent is if he's perfect I just and I just think the Patriots offense is going to be so good in this game against Atlanta's defense that. They're gonna score I think every time. They get the ball and and that means that Matt Ryan's gonna have to keep up. But did. Defense that Matt Ryan is now gone up against. This isn't green Bay's defense. Got a green Bay's defense. What is worst in Atlanta it's green Bay's pass defense is the second worst in football and if you watch that cowboys Packers game the week before Obama. And if you follow me on Twitter I traded out of pop Brady was a quarterback in that package. Cowboys game of the divisional round. Ray would've put up 35 points in the first half against those two pass defense is I mean. Yeah you gotta look at as for as much as people say well Atlanta slowdown Aaron Rodgers . Now a little wasn't really tested by a defense last week against remain. In Atlanta wasn't attached to Matt Ryan green Bay's defense is terrible. Source. The wall is angry neck. You know not to follow up why. Atlantis. And because of that. That's gonna force Matt Ryan to have to play perfect football against a defense that is a homage at an angry days. A defense that let that Matt Ryan saw last week so. I got it we got over a week to talk about this one and when you say that allowed you dig itself while this is going to be a long week next week but. Once you start seeing the players Strickland the Houston got me an idol Monday night. Roger Goodell talking on Wednesday. Yeah well if there was one question you could ask Roger Goodell that Wednesday press conference what would abate. Motivate it's got you gotta thank the deflate gay questions are common. And you gotta think that Roger rebels answer is gone. Include the word integrity. At least 25 times. With him. Not Nolan actual definition of integrity. On so deflate gay will be as storyline all week. And at at as as much is a week from Sunday it seems like always away it. Once you start seeing a plays trickle and you get all these press conferences to get it may be similar story lines. Blown out of proportion. Next thing at all. It'll be Super Bowl Sunday next thing you know we'll get that one image that water damage adding we all wanna see. Roger Goodell animal body trophy. To the knowing a patriot 61777979376177797. 9837. Wrapping up the show at this time up. But card talks about all new England sports on Sports Radio WEEI. Are wrapping up the show coming up next Saturday's day. We'll take you inside NHL all star weekend it took or ask Brad marsh and represented these. That's pretty good commercial they have. That went. Tuukka Rask is. And I believe is mosh candidate as well. But they've put out. I'm not gonna knocked hockey in LA. 'cause I have seen them put on some pretty good I I've seen an outdoor jam that they put on a couple of years ago I was pretty gut. I'm not a big fan of the outdoor game all the time. Blood. That was something I thought that was pretty special when I didn't think it would have to do. Yet on how all star weekend. In Los Angeles I'm sure they'll get that Saturday's game is rolls the state of the Bruins at the all star break if you wonder and about any Bruins. Update today Brad marsh and pulled himself out of the. Fastest skate competition he will still take pot 92 shooting competition but will not be part of the fastest skater competition. Some type of lower body injury the other and I did look like he went on the runway early and I game. But he did retirement. And mosh and I mean without am unaware the boroughs of so a lot then you don't you watch the not participate in the fastest gate copper digit. While Evans some type a low body tweak as miners that might be on perfectly fine. Width 61777979837. But there will get to all that at 6 o'clock on Saturday skater and a couple minutes here. To take some more football calls his. We continue to get ready for Super Bowl 51 a week from tomorrow. Go to Stephen Robinson upstate. I don't then you go to since taking my call it's recent New York Times but local law thank you any help. Not a lot hopeful born converts it to locate what do you think that it's all there. You know we might be underestimate you know in his defense courtesy collective challenge right now and not playing would extreme competence and the other thing I wanted to ask about one's. We know that gave -- eateries watch it you're at UT that had anything to do all without the world operative Ortiz began and it would at all. Way to navigate build a Gatorade splash at the AFC championship. Yeah. Yeah yeah I don't think the dear I don't have that AFC championship. Alt opt. I don't think so that's doesn't seem like the patriot way does it to rejoin the Gatorade splash of that you really do that Q indiscernible right. I could sit on just make an actor's. You know I like Goldman has the on the ball yeah honestly. Well you know what's gonna happen and I salute Goldstein doesn't happen. Or is someone's gonna this week and media night. You tell me someone. On the Atlanta Falcons . Offense. Is it gonna say some than met the patriots could use as bulletin board material you know what's gonna happen in fact I think the Vontae Freeman already sent something. Along the lines of we are gonna have all way with the patriot defense don't quote me on that word for word but it was something along those lines. Admiral that's going to be that they have fires up the patrons usually like the patriots underdogs. And maybe don't like me she admits Eleanor that they're gonna act that Tom Brady's gonna pop up the falcons defense and it's one of the going to be close. As the deal over the next week and change. Got to get some analysts on experts. Yeah out they're gonna continue to call the patriots cheaters they're going through. Picked the falcons to win this game I think maybe even someone from the falcons is gonna say something that fires up the patriots a could be used. By someone and the patriots organization to fire up members that I ballclub. So it will go down in which the patriots inside. That building. Inside their locker room. I got a great convinced themselves that. Either Robby and the document it is still the world against annoying on patriots. Everybody has ruled against the the patriots they know that and maybe that's the only thing that they need. The fact that. The flight gate is still a gang based on the fact that Brady served its board and suspension. To begin this season and maybe got revenge toy is only paying the fact that all the critics have ruled against the patriots. Maybe that's the only thing may need. Is the only thing ninety. The patriots in this game. Protect Auburn if you can do that. I've watched the falcons defense they all you want about what they've done the last two games it's been impressive defensively for Atlanta you know why it's been impressive. Because. That's not usually Holland looks at least in the first capitalist game against Seattle agreement. Right. What if you watched Atlanta for a lot of that she's and dad and I think what you should know about did he is. You can pick them a pot you can draw on them you can pass in Atlanta as the you can cob down mop you can put them in a situation we Dayton all. They're gonna have to win a shoot out. Because did defense can't stop. You decide and it. What where that's come back and play in this one week from Sunday is that the Patriots defense trying to stop Matt Ryan is all lot better than what Matt Ryan saw last week. Against the Green Bay pass defense that is one of the worst in football. But we got to know week to talk about it from our got another three dollars to talk about it. In the meantime get a podcast the data for cod shell and Danny for cod dot com also want I challenge Google play an anywhere podcasts are available. Saturday's date is next come on I'll talk to you tomorrow want.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - Atlanta Falcons news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NFL - New England Patriots news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Danny Picard - Super Bowl Match Up 3","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WEEI 93.7 FM","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"477455616","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"WEEI 93.7 FM","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.weei.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196771852","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:14:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Now now that WEEI trend you know. I'm Danny McConaughey is what's trending now on WEEI and WEEI. It dot com the patriots travel to Houston on Monday. The Super Bowl 51 Stephen Gostkowski and they have no bull returned to practice today at Gillette Stadium. The pats had perfect attendance at practice for the first time. All week the big game is one week from tomorrow the patriots are three point favorite over the Atlanta Falcons . And for those not in the Super Bowl the Pro Bowl kicks off. This weekend what is it tomorrow night at 8 o'clock and ESPN to be on the front I've got to that a Pro Bowl. So I don't really tip the Celtics won their second straight game last night crushing the Orlando Magic. 128 to 98 at the TV god and. Isiah Thomas had a game high 21 points Al Horford missed the game with a groin injury but he did travel with the team to Milwaukee. With a seasonal take on the box tonight at 8 o'clock. The Bruins are off until Tuesday night thanks to NHL all star weekend this weekend in Los Angeles. Tonight is the skills competition at 7 o'clock tomorrow the actual all star game of the third round of the Farmers Insurance open. Is underway at Torrey Pines. Already Schneider Janzen brand somatic tied for the lead at nine under at. Tiger Woods did not make the cut it is 39 degree. Rich Sox Bruins and patriots Celtics. About the mall now. He put guard 24/7. New England sports continues so. You card. Network. What's up welcome to the show I am your host Danny god take you up until 6 o'clock tonight. And taken you off phone call 61777979837. 61777979837. In the clarify my Pro Bowl schedule for those who do can't. Approvals tomorrow night at 8 o'clock on this yesterday can imagine losing in an NFL playoff game. And that Dolan to play dodge ball against other NFL players or not in the Super Bowl is that all about. I mean that's going to be a pretty humbling experience and it's like they're out there having fun. But if you are a player that was not a team for someone whose season has been all this week it like there there's some guys in the Pro Bowl that. Obviously new bye week seven and we gate they had no shot even get the playoff nevermind. You know have a chance to ensure normal but did you answer this why is that I can understand that happy to be needed to be on the big stage and to just be seen again on national TV. But there are sure other guys super stop players who were on playoff teams that are having a blast playing dodge ball. All we're in a weighing on people and Atlanta are talking about the Super Bowl and Super Bowl 51 I just. I try to put myself in the shoes of someone who lost in the playoffs and was. And then I had to go to the Pro Bowl chose to go to pro ball once been selected I'd think to myself. I wouldn't wanna be played dodge ball against other NFL players who didn't. Make the Super Bowl it just doesn't seem fun to me and federal situations like ice our video clip of Ezekiel Elliott. Slide it around out on the grass like on his needs and if I am a Dallas Cowboys . If I'm Jerry Jones and having a hot attack undone what I adored don't this slide around on the grass like that. He is sick you know in my opinion is the NFL MVP for misty and it's as and you wanna see. It to Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys but this weekend and this coming weekend next weekend it's not about the Pro Bowl it's not about. Any of those players who are seemingly having fun playing dodge ball right now. This is about. The best team in the L receivers the best team and and a seed you know England patriots first the Atlanta falcons' super ball 51 in Houston. A week from tomorrow right now the patriots a three point favorite in this scam. Going to the Super Bowl . Even at the end of the regular season the AFC team was at three point favorite over an FC team and I think. That was baggage Nolan that the patriots had the best chance to get there and at the patriot to be at three point favorite. Indiscernible so we've actually known this for awhile but that's the spread now that we know the opponent. The patriots falcons patriots a three point favorite this week and I told it is an all stock dams on NHL and even in the NFL. I get some golf on TV but. The focus. Is. People are gonna stop travel on a trickle in and now to Houston and the players will trickle in on Monday they will have media night. Monday night the last couple years they've changed the scheduled to media day what used to be Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon and morning afternoon now it's. It's Monday night they have media night prime time. Roger Goodell used to speak on Friday now he's gonna speak on Wednesday I wouldn't be surprised if they. Flip flopped that schedule around for Goodell a couple times just to make it a little bit more difficult for maybe some people. Cover the patriots to debt at a press conference I would Roger Goodell because you know all. The questions that are going to be asked I gotta be deflate gate related. And I think in this past week. And net you know did you get that you week's tip to look at this game so there's a lot of story lines there's a lot of different things to talk about. Sometimes. I would get it Nidal. I I don't want that extra week because. Certain story lines can get blown out of proportion all brought up again that because people just need to kill time like all of those. You know shows that on TV and get three guys sit in the seats and a raw arguing about some and they need to they needed to talk about to placate this past week right they needed that they needed to bring to placate up again not as they get it on the patriots which they do. Because they did things the talk about again x.s and always. Falcons patriots for two full weeks maybe get someone at this week you still have some. Crazy story lines that maybe I won't even be thinking of right now but this past week I did hear a lot of deflate gate. Someone wants to dip back into that I can understand it. The fact that this season with a flight data that the flake a punishment and the four game suspension for Tom Brady . He served that he accepted it he served at the patriots went three and one. That not all. There in the super ball Goodell is banned dodged the patriots he's van that refused to show up in Foxboro at Gillette Stadium I don't care if he shows up or not. But he has been reputed to do what it as some people fired up and potentially. We could be seen. Roger Goodell and the Lombardi trophy. What Robert Kraft and meant you know let the MVP. Possibly to Tom Brady I mean that's the way that bad. Celebration goes down they get elevated podium the confetti fallen at it'll be on fox strike the shoot malls on fox show. I have someone down math I I assume that I think in the past that they had Terry Bradshaw may be on the podium. But keep away whoever they have done then do any interviews on that podium good Dell's going to be on a podium at the patriots ran a they're gonna have wrapped telecheck and Tom Brady and Brady about the MVP somebody else. The patrons when the short ball which I actually expect and predict that they will. Tom Brady's gonna beat. The most valuable player because I do not see Atlanta's defense stopping Tom Brady in this game will get into that I'm here for three dollars. Today on the of the three dollars tomorrow. I want you a phone calls throughout the shows 61777979837. But regardless of the MVP is you know you gonna see Brady on that podium you know Belichick will be Daniel craft will be that if they win. And you know Dell's going to be so that's the story line. The thought. Of that meeting taken place in Houston on that stage with the confetti fall with the Lombardi trophy infidels and haven't and that over the patriots that thought. Knowing what Adele went out of his way to do to Tom Brady and the New England Patriots knowing how this season began with Brady not just. Being unable to plan a football game for the patriots. The other cable for the first four weeks even. Show up at Gillette Stadium would be and communication or contact with anybody and a major doting attention. Fell. Got to get a sitter put an extra dollars in debt and to deflate gay and why it was route we always stupid okay we know why it was stupid. But since it was so stupid. And since it actually happened Brady accepted the punishment and and that's how he began the season unable to show up at Gillette Stadium or talk to anybody on the team. The patriots don't want 31. They finished the season with a bad stretch of football at fourteen to two and I also want to or some other stuff. Which is. These Jamie Collins trade during the bye week which the patrons can compensation pick. Lot of people say that would be the thing that would. That would finish job Bill Belichick that's the bendable crossed the patriot way you can only make so many of these modes and get away with it and still have success. Fourteen to number one seed in the AFC we're all in into the super ball OK Roland and that is super ball. Then add some other situations the ball Sheehan situation retarded people look at and say well maybe something is going on inside that locker room and major it's continued to weather that storm Rob Gronkowski who began the season injured. He finished the season on injured reserve. Gunner against the Seahawks returned a couple of weeks later against the jets had a back injury had surgery. She's ending injured reserve people said well patrons can't win without rock. Not gonna happen. And it. There are the patriots Roland into the cerebral sold any things have actually gone wrong. They're going on patriots this season that I think out of all the story lines you can look at. I wrote this in my column for the Boston metro this week. This story on to many is that this is BC's in the perfect storm of events. This is this season. That is driving. The patriots critics. Crazy more than any other season. This season of fourteen and don't finish. And number one seed the home field advantage throughout the playoffs. You know through my favorite in the short ball without Rob Gronkowski. Knowing that it was suspended the first four games. This season. And the patriots success this season. Is drive and Brady and bella judge critics nuts like what can it possibly say now. What'd they say. And people. Really have. That you can't argue the success that team had and things that they had to go through today it will immediately go back to how the season began. And outside talking about why Kate made will say but the patriots cheat that's what they'll say. I mean I'm not talented to read his column. Put some guy in Atlanta wrote a piece and I just read the headlines because I don't think anybody. Should have to go through overrated some in this stupid their entire lives. I just read that line it said what to tell you our kids about to placate. And my biggest issue with that is. If you all wake up that morning and you ought actually had a conversation with your kids about deflate gate. I think someone needs to sit you down and have a conversation. With you about why you are talking to kids about. Ridiculous. Like you'll have the problem. Brady the patriots not. It's the PSI have all you really have a chat with your kids about that. If you thought this something wrong with you. OK and I think the question that this columnist Atlanta asked was. The late can't mean that and the success that the patriots haven't afterwards. Visit me that. We should it isn't really the message to the kids should be well if you cheat you get even get away with it have success. That's that's basically what this columnist was hesitant. And tell if they're any message about the flight date instead the tide of. All those and a pretty proven that. The last time they turn through the Super Bowl . As you know to he has got to beat the Seahawks Malcolm but a miraculous interception. You go from being down on the ground on hands and knees. Ryan and and slam and and onto the ground like I was. John good majority. The Dem second I don't knock Obama picks out on top of the flight gate the gate and did two weeks before and I didn't. So the flight eight we hadn't even really know they hadn't even gone into. The house report and all that craziness help. Now the patriots are back and it's a season in which Brady. Janet. Went to the certainly don't like it four game suspension and anybody that's gonna argue anything about the patriots coming into this one next Sunday. All saying that they are really gonna argue. Is gonna go back to. To placate and they got a call the patriots cheated once again now you don't I'm not. I I don't get it that anymore I've been done I did so done with the flight gate before the wells reporting it came out. But this is what you got some people don't now. All that said when you actually forget about the PSI as a football and it. You wanna break down these two teams the patriots and the falcons an X is and always portion of it. I heard John Tomas CNY show at the beginning of the show say something I completely agree with. Which is that a lot of talk is going to be a ball. The quarterbacks and you know Matt Ryan and and more specifically when you talk about the falcons their offense Lotta people got to raved about that offense. You're right we sell. And people money compliant again against Green Day and the first half and say well let his defense shut out Aaron Rodgers and green Bay's offense in the first half. And that NFC championship. And along with that Dodd and the thought of raising Atlanta's offense. The one thing that I think is gonna be overlooked. Is that Atlanta's defense. Is terrible. It's awful. Atlanta's pass defense. Is one of the worst in the National Football League OK is. But depends. In part that's a fact. Atlanta's best defense is one of the worst and the National Football League in a regular season Atlanta's pass defense toy may eighth in the league. Only 32 teams in NFL Atlanta's pass defense alone 266. Point seven yards in the year I get away from us that's for men have you watched Atlanta's pass defense most of the season you should know that it's no good. Not you might argue well and is pass defense and their defense in general looked pretty damn good against Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay. Let's last week and NFC championship. You know what you're right especially in the first half. Atlanta 1241 up lead at the half out of four is Green Bay in the some mistakes. But I think that Atlanta deeper into performance was deceiving. That's is a this even defense of performance as you'll ever gonna see. In my opinion in the NFL what fun. Because that place was rock and whether it was real crowd noise or not that George at all. Was rocking and you cannot tell me that that didn't affect Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay offense it did that's a real and that affects them. And Mitt Atlanta loves planet home okay and they love it. And when you jump out to a lead like that. Aaron Rodgers degree they put some points in the second half but it point green Bay's defense now can't stop a nose bleed in general so that they'll be at home mom and play at all. They weren't going to be stopped acting like it was over at the end of the first court. All land and needed was a two touchdown lead but I came to be over the degree you know green Bay's defense wasn't stop and Matt Ryan. In Atlanta at the Georgia Dome shell that sent judges pick Atlanta's defense of performance. Last week was deceiving. And new people might point out and say well they got a shot against the patriots I don't think Atlanta's defense as a shot against the patriots I don't. I think that this is going to be won those games with Tom Brady just pops up Atlanta's past the. It adds I said it's about the Steelers last week I'll say it again. What that lamp that the only shot they really have is if they can get the Tom Brady but the one thing I will say about Atlanta's the eight the last couple weeks. If there is one phrase I do have but it defense is that they have shown the ability. Where at some big fast guys up front to be able to get the quarterback with outset and outs they they have that ability to do. However I also think that ability the last couple weeks is deceiving because Green Bay had some offensive line issues at least I saw at the beginning of the season. And Seattle offensive line issues which were much more well documented. Than anyone else is in the lead. All you right Russell Wilson was running for his life. In Atlanta couple weeks ago. But when games are an Atlanta icy Atlanta I watched them completely different team in this game's at a neutral site. Don't tell Jack. I have to talk pretty two weeks to prepare. I'm sorry I think that. I don't I don't even think this is an opinion. I think this is the fact this is the worst defense that Brady's gonna face in this season. But it's close. With regards to throw the football. So protect pretty. This game shouldn't even be close and the only way it will be. Of the patrons protect Brady is up and up Atlanta's defense like expect them to know this game is going to be close is if Matt Ryan is perfect. Perfect Matt Ryan needs to be perfect in this game if he's not helpful behind Brady will score every single possession against this Atlanta team and that's what appealed. Now the over under on this one is fifteen on dirt speck in a shootout if it's a shootout the patriots are gonna win that shootout. And a again maybe the most overlooked and coming into this game is the fact that the patriots difference I mean you wanna match up the patriots defense and Atlanta's defense trying to close. Coach and don't get it led beyond bell missed. Most of that game left early last week. And you'll still have an elite quarterback you're still that the best wide receiver in my opinion of football Antonio Brown. Do you do against a white and they did and did they leave again. Patriots stopped. Pittsburgh's offense they defense stopped Pittsburgh's offense so if people wanna talk about a test. With the goal which are not support they got it tests last week. And Mitt. They didn't failed a test they passed that test with flying colors and does what now they go up against Atlanta offense that is. I obviously everybody is. Be much more powerful right Julio Jones Matt Ryan got the two headed monster and Coleman of Freeman of the backfield. You gotta you should know he was a big pop that Atlanta game plan early and often against Green Bay last week he got the kid Gabriel can do some damage she's a. He can be. Passed out there he so small and so fast that he can make big plays. What I just feel like the defense is. That. You know when you match these two defense is up the patriots and Atlanta's big nightclubs. And if I have my money on one of these two quarterbacks. Who like to put up big numbers Brady and Ryan. I'd put my money on whom would have the big day. Against their opposing defense is it's just it's not even a question I don't even think twice about gritty. Should. Pop up the Atlanta Falcons defense. And the Patriots defense should slow all have to do Sloane Matt Ryan battle that. He won't be able to keep up with Andre and tell my prediction that is one. A week from tomorrow and used to shoot the ball 51 patriots when they come out in fact this one we need to be. Fourteen did you need to be a fourteen point spread for me to even think about it. Even think about taken points aidid the patriots should women added they should win this one break I honestly. I don't think that. Matt Ryan is going to be able Ricky pop into neutral site of this game was in Atlanta the Georgia don't it was rocket like that a signal that they get a chance that creates some habit early may be get to Brady. And it did ever shot it's not it's in a neutral site it's not going to be anywhere close to his a lot of the Georgia Dome was. Atlanta doesn't. You know a big they don't seem to be as comfortable offensively. On the road. As they are home and certainly did defense. I can not. Matched their defense up against Tom Brady and then that Atlanta's defense is gonna have a good day I just can't do it 617. 7797983761777979837. Where a week away from Super Bowl 51 and I want you are thoughts and predictions yup phone calls after this time out. The weekend new England sports conversation continues with the Danny put cards right now on Sports Radio. We've EI. 61777979837. On it till 6 o'clock taking your phone calls. Patriots falcons Super Bowl if they want a week from tomorrow patriots. Practice today at a perfect practice attendants made evident Stephen Gostkowski . Returning to practice. August 'cause he had an illness for anybody in my. The concerned about some type of injury and then he had AB's deal with a second cell. He retired today so that's five patron to practice again tomorrow there will head to Houston on Monday then Monday night Adobe media night. At Super Bowl 51. And here's senator Roger Goodell who used to speak on Fridays at the Super Bowl . Now speak on Wednesday 61777979837. Let's go to Thailand. Is in Iowa egg ally good how you drag your outlook apart by a couple things. You know I hate to tell. Adults so much but not a lot of other people that only opposite. There are no I got some of the blame as well like. Gotta you've got guys like you know Greg I know I'll have black art. Moderate to work archive did not actually got chat well. You know obviously you know is accused from the start. They're not mad at. Matchup that's so loud it all worked out you know what I lied about attorney client privilege it. Pat well where are. You know bought over the outlook report knocked it. Not. Oh yeah lawyer. We live it we lost pile of them. You wanna use doc and flight gate the NF LPI lawyers. And maybe don't call back Tyler would we busted phone connection so try to dent Denny's in Montreal it's up Danny. I know. So what's going on in. The government. But did you know now it does you have to show up the the other AFC or an and that's championship game RW's Alec requirement. I don't know all what the job description says on that comment was shown that if you're the commissioner of a legion you have. Through championship games you should be out at you should be out one of. This say about of our boat than it has to be in this NATO policy yesterday. Where do you think you go. And the saints. He'd go to New Orleans. I noticed anybody go to new loans I think this is. This is fresh not him in bed the Brady saying it was fresh he would have even gone into loans he was not gonna come a joint stating it's good but anyway he was not coming to Gillette Stadium season. Not side I figured that probably. Republican ten notes and it patriots. I think it's in the actually think you're going to be audible though there is going to be around like 351430. Seventeen. Yeah I think you're on the money I think you're on the the right spot without one. I just don't see. How Atlanta's defense is gonna stop Brady you know I'll outstanding delegates at about Pittsburgh you gotta get to Brady get in his face. Win that game is not in Atlanta yeah. You know Houston an odd G stadium is that what they call it used to be Reliant Stadium that place is not going to be rocket like the Georgia Dome was. So Brady's not going to be rattled. And and I think Atlanta's pass rush don't think it's a big athletic guys up front that in the last couple weeks have been able to disrupt. Because what the quarterback can do blood. I think that when you look at Green Bay stoppage of lie and they had major injury issues right this season and Seattle's it is. Big time offensive line issues which Seattle all season long the Patriots offense of if that thing. We haven't really talked about on the up until that Houston playoff game put before that in. We weren't talking about it and all that's a great thing is it doing their job I I just don't think Atlanta's defense is going to be able to slow down Tom Brady . This is the worst deeper and Brady will face in his post season. And it's Dutch economy Matt Ryan will have to play in my opinion a perfect game to just keep up with the score in other expect I scorn over on its 59. Matt Ryan's gonna need a perfect game shall bomb built bella Jack and Matt Patricia and I got two weeks. I got two weeks the dial up a defense. That's got to basically prevent Matt Ryan from having a perfect day am I mean I'm gonna put my money that they'll be able to do that. And I then yeah you're gonna see some some sneaking as early on I had Logan Ryan comment on a blitz. Com and just basically just dropped and Matt Ryan's rhythm that he's been on the last couple weeks. So. I expect the Patriots defense to slow down Matt Ryan and up where he is not gonna keep up with Tom Brady . Who will be I then throw the ball at will against this Atlanta. Passed defense Bob is in layman puts Obama. Pay Balata ball on how it's happened dude. And that I did I. As much as I agree with you on the falcons' defense I do think one thing is you know walked in with so often that they have. You know before the game and not erupt fourteen point so being sucked constantly slowing the ball. Against Atlanta defense which you know kind of you know that's out to me a little bit. Would you agree with that. Well what what do I tell you that there is a defense that's not gonna allow Atlanta to get up fourteen points. And and that's fine but obviously in the stats aren't that may to Atlanta secondary ultimately may be worse than may not because when you constantly get it wrong on all game you know. You know I don't think it makes the bat a little water and they might. Are you got to look at it this way and you know art I. It has Atlanta but I've based in goods bought as they spotted themselves fourteen points in most of the games they played out and finally put up big numbers are right and all. I know that that is a prolific offense Don Aaron Atlanta. Hi a solid and high speed and they put up you know some of the biggest numbers and football offensively they love doing. But let's say that is date they are up fourteen points and were up fourteen not in every game. And UA defense. It's they had run the football witness not to pass yeah I would not make it easier for you to stop the pass. That's actually I don't keep adamant and not play devil's advocate that's mean look at what the falcons pass defense. Should be JoAnne. I guess under the theory that you have of Apollo Atlanta begins games but I have that were the case. It gave Rick a look at the short oval Tom Brady could. I ain't the Tom Brady's gonna throw the football and and in I would Garret blunt didn't get as much planned time in the first playoff game the followers to not ever heard again against Pittsburgh. So courage I don't know with the patriots can't run the football against Atlanta I think they'd be crazy to I think they'd be crazy to around that they're gonna be thinking of a period like that mean you look at the numbers in your a look at the film. Age you know the do you control on Atlanta's defense and I and no one you can draw on Atlanta's defense especially in a neutral site announcing by the patriots wouldn't do they will do. And I'll have success doing Mike is in Quincy atop might. What's up I can't get a little bit of the different take on it let me and aren't god that I'm you know not Ryan I'm not too sure he can win the big game and and I don't know how many. You know NFL big games he's been in power. Well I'm an easy just 1200 one's the last two weeks. You're right you're right playoff games in open I'm talking about you know I wanna go back to his 07 season as a senior BC not followed him a lot more when you play college. And he actually had BC and number two in the country going central Florida State game at home. But he ended up getting beat on throwing an interception at the end of the game run back for a touchdown. And then later on that he's in. Actually made peace CC championship against Virginia Tech and did the exact same thing lost. I'm just not too confident he can actually win that big stage big game to put these came over the top. Well I mean to be honestly in my thanks for the call I could care less what Matt Ryan did a PC I really don't care when it comes to this game. And what he's gonna do against the Patriots defense what he did for the Boston College Eagles. At least to me is meaningless I think if you spend time going back to look at Matt Ryan's college paper right now. I don't know I mean I think I I think yet too much time on your hands I I don't think that has any of that is not to have. Any effect on an ad that's not a knock on people like BC football but that's fine. I mean I'm I'm just I'm not a college football guy. In general it's just it's just not many. So. What whatever you want to do you a big cultural pop and a fine you like Boston College football it's fun not knocking you for that. But right now in this specific instance. Whip. Falcons and the patriots in the super ball. Do you really wanna go back and stop looking at what guys did in college to figure out of they're gonna have success and this one. But Mike. Where might makes a point. He's not crazy with this is that when he asked the question can Matt Ryan when the big debt and not sort of interrupted a man I said. Well he just won two big ones against Seattle again that I didn't think he was gonna win but they did and then against green bank. I picked on a big Green Bay got a lot of people picking the package based on what Aaron Rodgers who's doing how good he looked and the way he was Rolen. I people thinking that he was just gonna have a special season and he wasn't going to be stopped. Well he got stopped I think because they were on the road that it was in one small difference or. You know different story but but you have to go back to the beginning of the season you know I may be Green Bay didn't have as much success. They have some offered a lot of injuries an issue was because and so. A question. Ten Matt Ryan win a big damn. It's it's going to be asked because we bastards so many times in the past in his NFL career forget about college in his NFL career. I was saying the same things about him coming into this post season. I show I think when they play Seattle even though it's in Atlanta. I just think the way Matt Ryan's career has gone he's gonna soil himself in the big spot and and not wasn't just. How big that was a crazy got a regular a lot of lot of people that knew that. That was the potential based on what he's done in his NFL career which is drone that big pick and a big spot wrote that big interception not when the big game. But may feel like that a couple weeks ago even some like myself has to acknowledged that and I think Mikey did you have to acknowledge. That the last two games that Matt Ryan is one had been big games you can't tell me and not. I'm not a big Matt Ryan fan when it comes to win in the big dance. Like you'll put you have to bring your beat Seattle like that and big difference regardless of the injuries Seattle's defense that can be Seattle. And then you beat a great big team got a lot of people had picked him at the VU general relevant that well. The rewards and to not acknowledge those high paying too. I think is a little crazy you have to acknowledge it but now this is the biggest one right this is the biggest one from that. I got up kitty when the big game. Question now is Kenny when the biggest one. And at it that to me it as a as it follows client I just. His college career. Matt Ryan's college career has nothing to do. Out with what he could or could not do in the Super Bowl against the patriots 617. 7797983761777979837. Matt Ryan. Needs the hope that his defense can have in my opinion what's gonna need to be a miraculous performance against a Tom Brady led offense that I think. Is gonna pop up that falcons. 617779. 79837. More got phone calls after this timeout. But card talks about all new England sports on Sports Radio coming. I wrapped enough Apollo one. On me until 6 o'clock taking your phone calls. 61777979837. 61777979837. As we have sort of will call it the Super Bowl bye week. Patriots practice today don't practice again tomorrow and they will head to Houston on Monday Monday night. Will be immediate night in Houston. And then the big game a week from tomorrow patriots three point favorite. Over the falcons when this line first came all I know old AFC team was at three point favorite. Going to the Super Bowl before they even knew the teams. By. I thought that land net may do winner of the match up patriots found those. I I didn't think that the patrons would be maybe a six point favorite. What is to three point fit. And so to me got a jump all over and a patriot when I think they went by more than three I know some people are gonna hold up their predictions. Maybe till next week. They needed some time to take it all and look at all the matchups I've looked all the matchups I've watched Atlanta's defense a lot this season. You know if you are a daily fantasy play you are always interested in the falcons because their offense is so high pollen. You know Matt Ryan what you'll look to see. What they match up saw Julio Jones Matt Ryan and that's a duel that you what you call a stack. Yes back and Matt Ryan Julio Jones a lot Dovonte for it and someone you look at if your daily fantasy plant. Ma so. If that's where you stay and you know what the falcons are offensive. But. I also think maybe you pick some of those guys in your daily fantasy sports lions because. Well. You know they're gonna be involved and assure the public good defense just is an act and other teams are gonna score on. And met when it third. Tom Brady and what he could do against this Atlanta defense. The fact that it's not going to be an Atlanta. I'm sorry I just I did don't think they have what it takes to slow him down and all I really don't soul. I agree with sort of the high school orange. Prediction Namibia bag it says over on his 59. But. Outfit is I escorted because I think the patriots put up the most points to three point spread in this one patriots. A three point favorite I jumped all over early is noted for me to wait to get my prediction of where you know what's gonna happen. Patriots minus 361777979837. Much coach who would John and Sean avail what's up John. Anyway Chatman and on lodged with a lot. 100 legitimate candidate and I'm sure you're most proper notice there's a lot of movement in the mud can't. Okay yeah actual actually delay what type of movement are we talking about Jonny boy yeah. Probably the point after I'm OK I believe that I honestly believe that when the money just to commend you know we sort of format like. And I don't got a job my job it's it was important right. You know. The shock to peak at the BC docs. The Atlanta Falcons locker that would escape and want to them deliberately. Bred and re. I like. I like that I like that bags at a college let's go to jello and some notes on joint. That grabbed me on the odds are a dual purpose but saying. Huge patriots spent a cute and they're gonna win pretty handedly but I'd do what rollout at. I think that out and keep that is getting a little bit. Underrated here. And I have been following them throughout the season and I do I do realize that you know they've. They have been struggling at unit throughout all year and given up by us pretty high scoring games. But I want just. Like you know. Having no such. Probably televised games in the playoffs typically in the last weeks. It seemed like he. But the falcons had been looking. Fairly sharp I mean just to point out you know and I agreed that the that the two game they played ball and you know coming up to the Super Bowl . I wouldn't expect not to went in there and not only that but gains were kind of what can mean by the third or what quarter the game was older. And guess specifically look at a game. Score sheet. That by have to Wear and I think what the Seahawks. Put up. Ten point I think I had time on the falcons defense and then and then thirteen total. Entry in the fourth quarter but you know when the game is over. And the packet that they did they are shut out at. Least one in Atlanta at the in an innocent and the Contra Packers are entrenched. You know hyped up in Oakland from the numerous media gauntlet this is Aaron Rodgers to. You know make an argument for one of the greatest quarterbacks our generation and possibly alt chimed in just looking at his numbers you know you'd. He had a boost in the whole second after the season we're acutely in. Fantastic and I and I and I understand that the practice. We're a little bit optic and there Roger this year and a guy like that playing at such a higher level did beat shutout and halftime there. By that falcon defense that. Are being claim to being you know one of the worst intentional leak. I I you know I got to do. Throughout debt you know at least these last two games. Opt in my view the Pittman played pretty well and they are a little bit underestimated. And I actually won one sort thing that I I think it a little bit wild card come into the soup Campbell I don't think the patriot to get that much trouble with it. But you'd think they're being under undervalued. By at least the last two games that they've played. Well where we agree actually called Joseph mean you agree wood on the the Patriots offense is gonna have too much trouble with Atlanta's defense and also agree with you that Atlanta's defense the last two games. And a big playoff games against Seattle in Green Bay. Atlanta's defense they've shown up and you know a bit it's been obvious from from the opening kick off Atlanta's defense with what they were joined. Is that didn't make him cornerback. Don't make quarterbacks like typical. Byte by Russian Russian four and get a little and I didn't need this in the house to get the call it a bit Russell Wilson run around like crazy and I came Aaron Rodgers sometimes it seems like. He enjoys ran around anyways so it may be that it's tough to tell with him what. You really could tell on that Seattle game they would get into the quarterback and the I think against Green Day . Am and maybe this plays into both of those games the way the crowd was that affect an offense I don't how good your offenses. It's gonna affect you especially if your conference that has had a offensive line injuries and issues throughout the season. Like Seattle's and I guess to a lesser extent Green Bay. This salt. And we always have a defense and success in the last two games at least in the first capital games. When that you know Atlanta hadn't. I had all the way. Basically they haven't success because they get the quarterback and but I think a big part of that. Was not just offensive line is they were going up against but also the fact that they were playing ball. I really do think that is a major at that that was a major major issue for. Bald Seattle and green Bay's offense planned that George Ballmer. You know it the last two games that they ever gonna play there. Sentimental value I have no idea but they don't fight it up and net. It was loud whether it was real crowd noise a fake crowd noise was loud enough I think to affect both of those offenses that are forward gave Atlanta's defense an average. I have that edge in this game. I should Atlanta's defense played on the road this season and I've seen that has defense at times you don't play at all and struggle against. High powered offenses. But on. If there's one thing about Atlanta beat. That definitely jumps off the screen via a common and that is Super Bowl look and at the last two games. Is that they're big athletic guys up front have been able to win their one on one battles with offensive linemen and and get that a quarterback and given some threats. And you know what if they're gonna do that the Tom Brady didn't didn't they have a shot but a tight that they won't do it to Tom Brady because Dan. I have that edge of being the home team and haven't plays rock and form. Went when Tom Brady has the football the Patriots offense of the football Atlanta's V for Ed read a defense is gonna have a marriage and on top of it. What I've seen from the patriots upwards of one season as an offensive line on that a Dante Scarnecchia coached offensive line once again is. Did they have commons room. With even a halftime adjustments that are gonna change the game floater up and so if they do struggle early I would expect the second apple but different. And it did fix whatever is going on upfront. Right protect Tom Brady you will win this game. And it. That means that Matt Ryan the other and if I gave it what happened to the Patriots offense. That happened Tom Brady puts up big numbers. Matt Ryan on the other hand he's gonna have to keep up that he's gonna have to be perfect because the Patriots defense out last column mentions Atlanta's defense not getting enough credit. I still think we haven't been talking about the Patriots defense enough. We haven't because business I do float around in this town that well. The numbers in the stats don't match up pretty I tested does it did not doing what the stats show did not as good as maybe the numbers will give. They haven't played only quarterback to cancer airplane only quarterback in big big planner and we quarterback last week and then drop as part and it did. And only quarterback who is an oh please. Wide receiver Antonio Brown so you can't make that argument anymore and from people who say well let me on doughnut chart. I got nursery even before Delgado hurt it didn't look like the patriots are going to be that CNET. It's sort of figured out that hesitation status that the line of scrimmage right and that's the way I start from the get. At a point where I'm sitting their goal and even the first couple times Bogut abolish it he's not gonna he's not gonna do damage to. He's not doing damage to. But injury aside you're still playing much reduced to play against an elite quarterback. And an elite wide receiver don't tell me didn't attempt to pitcher's defense did what happened. What happened. The Patriots defense. Once again. They'd they'd pass the test. This will be the biggest as much like it will be the biggest us Matt Ryan this will be the biggest that's a patron difference by a if I'm gonna pick one of these two defense is to have the better at night. In the Super Bowl it's going to be at the Bill Belichick act Matt Patricia defense that as two weeks to prepare for a quarterback. That is gonna have to be perfect in this wanna keep up with a pump ready who's gonna cob up and Atlanta Falcons defense just don't that's just the way I seed has been planned out. But you can't that I Atlanta's defense they have had success the last couple weeks in big spots now given that 617779. 7983761777979837. More to phone calls after this final.

Precise Price, whether utilized by customers online or sales teams on the showroom floor, integrates with dealerships' CRM and desking platforms for seamless data synchronization of pricing information for a more efficient and transparent desking experience. \n \nConsumer pricing with confidence \nPrice misinformation and doubt over getting the best deal are leading sources of frustration for car buyers, compromising trust and confidence in the transaction. According to the 2016 Dealership Action Report, distrust toward salespeople is the top reason customers dislike the car-buying process. \n \n\"Precise Price accelerates the lengthy desking process and educates consumers with greater transparency to evoke customer trust and confidence in the car purchasing experience,\" said Aaron Schinke , Director of Product Management at DealerSocket.� \"There should be no surprises when a customer walks into a dealership. Precise Price helps put everything on the table in advance, creating a more enjoyable and efficient experience for both the dealer and customer.\"� \n \nPrecise Price puts all of the information in the customer's hands, allowing them to be at the center of the deal and to lead the purchase with confidence, without providing personal information or creating an account. It also allows consumers to get the exact same price at home as they would in the dealership � no guesses or estimates. Dealers also build customer trust through utilization of a familiar pricing platform, and shared access of the calculated deal. \n \nPrecise Price incorporates all possible price influencers, including: \n Dealership incentives and fees  State and local taxes  Trade-in evaluation  Down payment  F&I protections  Vehicle protections  And more  \nTrue time savings \nPrecise Price is an exclusive integrated solution that offers true time savings for both dealers and customers. When customers initiate a transaction and desired payment structure on a dealer's website, the information is automatically synced to the dealer's CRM. This eliminates duplicate efforts by sales teams re-collecting customer information at the time of the visit. When the customer walks through the door, the deal is ready to send to the dealer's DMS, saving the dealer and customer valuable time. \n \nSeamlessly access the deal on any device at any time \nThe tool is mobile friendly and responsive so both dealers and customers can easily access the deal. With an industry-first \"Save & Finish Later\" functionality, customers are able to pick up exactly where they left off on any device at any time. Team members can also structure deals in-store to be sent to customers for revisions and completion from anywhere. \n \nUnlike other third-party pricing models, DealerSocket's digital retailing solution uniquely allows every dealer to brand Precise Price as their own and keep the customer on their own website and within their system. The tool does not redirect customers to a third-party website, allowing dealers to market precise digital retailing as part of the customer service offerings. \n \nTo learn more about DealerSocket Precise Price, visit dealersocket.com/precise-price .

Patriots come Sports Radio 93 point seven WEEI ask them any HD one glorious box did. Now that WEEI trending now. I'm David McConaughey is what stranded now on WEEI. And WEEI. Dot com. The patriots travel to Houston on Monday for Super Bowl 51 a Stephen Gostkowski and innate Evan a ball returned to practice today at Gillette Stadium. The pats had perfect attendance at practice for the first time all week. The big game is one week from tomorrow the patriots are three point favorite over the Atlanta Falcons . And for those not in the Super Bowl approval kicks off tomorrow night at 8 o'clock on ESPN. The Celtics won their second straight game last night crush in the Orlando Magic 128 and 98 at the TV got him. Isiah Thomas had a game high 21 points. Al Horford missed last nights game with a groin injury but he did travel with the team to Milwaukee where the seas will take on the box tonight at 8 o'clock. The Bruins are off until Tuesday night thanks to NHL all star weekend this weekend in Los Angeles. Tonight is these skills competition at 7 o'clock he also again is tomorrow. And the third round of the Farmers Insurance open is underway at Torrey Pines Patrick Rogers and Brandt Snedeker a tied for the lead at nine under. Tiger Woods did not make the cut. It is 39 degrees and cloudy in Boston clip tonight with a low of 320. And that's what struck enough. Rich ducks Bruins patriots Celtics. About them all yeah. Twin forces and the new England sports continues so it's getting going there. The card. Network. All of number two line here until 6 o'clock and I'm taking your phone calls. 61777979837. 61777979837. I do have the Farmers Insurance open. On the TV and brought me. And it is amazing to see some of the game is there early in the season that did not make the cut. Tiger Woods. Jason Day Dustin Johnson. Ricky followed but Tiger Woods is the guy that everybody's watching Macon is retarded he's shooting 76. So for all the pie yesterday. Odds union in the first on the first day on Thursday and yes they shot a 72. Nominee even 72 itself. A title would not make the cut that seems to be the biggest story line sulphide these Farmers Insurance open and fun to see him make the cut. And it up again his retirement. With an exciting tournament but that obviously is not the case. My attention. I'm 110%. Though is on this show bubble a week from tomorrow. I've the patriots when not in it you know that probably would not be the case and I was trying to think earlier while the pitcher Warren and miserable what would be. You know the top Boston sports story line today and I would think but caused the Bruins are at the break. You could do one of those win the Bruins stand at the all star break I'd sorry I just. For the first half of the season or at least the free all star break. Version of the Boston Bruins. I just the way I would describe them. Tough to watch that's the way I would describe them. They went into the all star break on a high note put. Tough to watch the Celtics like and put 'cause. They blow all the Orlando Magic last night they had a huge win against the Houston Rockets before that after a brutal lots. So Washington Wizards tonight before that. That lost the wizards it was embarrassing if that was just an embarrassing loss the wizards were talking trash you know the I don't wanna say rivalry between those two teams but recently there have been some things going on with the wizards in the Celtics where it for God's. You know some bad blood if you wanna call it that and some pushing and shoving after the whistles or after games. You know there was out storyline it all along with that wizards Celtics game and the wizards just we're talking trash. Lancing and are gonna Wear all black like it was the Celtics funeral and they want to sell itself to the job but again. They did show up against. A damn good rockets team that out of that may be Houston. And that was a big time when for the Celtics showed a lot about Eminem may have Al Horford missed at last night's damage still warp. The Orlando Magic and of course Avery Bradley is out as well. He could need I believe may be another week we'll see what's allowing ten Al Horford did make the trip. Tonight to Milwaukee but maybe that would be the store on but. You know that's those are what it's the reality is the patriots aren't Super Bowl and other top story on. Right no soul. The question is he had all week this past week in everybody on national TV bring it up deflated again. Now these teams are gonna show up to Houston on Monday an immediate night on Monday night. When you look at all the potential story lines. You know the question I asked myself is what is the top story. Edmonton his game right pushed the top story. Is at the plate gate is at the fact that Brady began the season. Suspended. The first four games for his deflate paid punishment. Is today at the fact that the patriots traded Jamie colleges that Rob Gronkowski he's not playing in this camp is at. All right two quarterback league you gotta have one too wet. On her neighbors Matt Ryan we're talking about elite guys when it comes to put up big numbers in this league. Isn't the major difference. Rich statistically. Has been one of the best defenses and. A ball all you along and only improved as the season went on but. People would still. Look at those stats and not give the Patriots defense enough credits and I haven't been tested by an elite quarterback they haven't been tested. Finally offense I don't think you can say that any law. After the way they played against Big Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown last week. Right but but that's another story line you know people got to get in tip of course they're gonna get into the relationship. Between Brady. Ballot check. And trump of course they gonna get into that you know that's going to be storyline. The storyline that I wrote about in a pomp and BC Boston yesterday check it out and NBC boston.com a story on. Is that at the beginning of the season if you do want to mention to placate what you have to acknowledge that aren't the patriots put out already won three in what. And it. The first two games. It was Jimmy grapple now I know Rob Lowe got hurt in in week two against Miami. But he left the game that anyone not that we know Miami came back in the second half made that close made got a ballgame right there in what are patrons don't want. I would like that they don't drop below it that week to win over Miami was moving the football if they did better at managing him. Of that game would not have been close. A drop below in the first game. A big land Arizona. And that net aegis cop got the dolphins defense for a quarter and half and we true. And and jumped out to a 21 up we needed. You know I think you're below is a story on him because he have immediate access at some point next week. And when people look at port has Vick did do the Brady story line Sunnis 39 years old he has the patriots. Magical round at a bella checker on how much time is Brady have deflate it well when he was out they showed that they had a quarterback that might be the next. The next big thing you know England. And just to Rob Lowe will have the people will have media access to drop load they'll ask him some questions about his future. And that I'm sure was some other people on the patriots organization going to be asked about her Apple's friction I mean we about an a hole of the week to talk about this game. It's not just got to be x.s and o.s as you well when you watch Super Bowl coverage there are going to be saw this story. And if we're gonna look at some of the story lines outside of X isn't always that might be juicy to a point where. May at a night got to catch somebody says this game. The wrong paying not and Iran things got a cut on anyone's mall in the patriots locker room what. Again this story line is there for the taking. For somebody. To come out with the idea of a lot of the patrons do we Jimmy Europe. And is Donna as the back up. He's a one boy eras contract next year. Patriots right now. No they already the favorite to win next year's super little. It's not because they expect or apple ought to be the quarterback aides meg pretty good quarterback and expect them the blank at a high level. Right CO all is story lines I'm sure there a couple long that I haven't mentioned that I'm not thinking about that will come up. I'm sure there. But. Eight the top story line is this season as a whole. What the patriots was still able to do with everything I didn't gold away from the deflated suspension. To trade in its one of their best defense of play is for compensation draft pick to gronkowski missed in the beginning of the season and then. And being placed on season ending injured reserve. Did you know a big day battle everything that the people who hit the patriots were above to see them try to battle and if the patriots whether the stalled. And hitting is whether the stalled. They came out with the best record in football. And they Al Roland into the Super Bowls at three point favorite and that if you take a step back and ask me why it's gonna happen in the Super Bowl I think the patriots in an overall on the Atlanta Falcons . Because I do not and warned not put money on the falcons' defense in a neutral site to slowdown Tom Brady and his Patriots offense. And in fact. The Patriots defense. I sure haven't regional last couple weeks that cannot get the credit that they should be yet. And net I understand people wanna do that. After a win against rock us while. Orders us Lila Madonna I understand they wanna do that against on the quarterbacks but the patriots faced in the regular season. I take you sought after at this consider and act. If you're a critic of the Patriots defense got to consider given them some praise for stopping Roethlisberger and around the last re. You have to. And I just. What I expect to happen next Sunday is I expected cannot be pretty mean you think of the patriots in the Super Bowl . Yeah that it Tom Brady in the super ball in the four championships that he has. This six appearances. That he's made it in this big damn. And net you know you look at the scores of these games you'll look at the nail bite is that they had bad. I'm not saying and that is due to be an issue global Brady drew for a for a ball but I will say. Out of the teams that have given. Let's say in a leaked Tom Brady trouble. Or at least made it close in a Super Bowl goes have been defense is that don't match up. United is different doesn't match up at a deeper into the federal. And you can point out the last two playoff games are a lot like some calls have tried to door but the bottom line is yes. When you are one of the worst pass defense is in football. And you are going up against. A quarterback who clearly. Is playing right now at a level. That. People around the league a lot in the play act anymore is a real thing with this revenge to. And you look at the weapons that Brady asks. Eva when I'll rock. It just to me the patriots have set themselves up to not just be successful in the Super Bowl and win it but to win it big. I just don't think this Atlanta defense stands a chance against Tom Brady and in a neutral site I really don't Sam is in the college attempt. And again you elicit your show that you're you know rabble are brought up what's happening to opt out. Great job and no doubt it got better earlier for the brick right. What's it all odds right now odds but does Brad Hogg. That is get you know. I know I just see mine eyes have modest rate I have to we have to look up I don't know. Yeah Ali get those odds or something like. You know I did two or something like. Oh. Think about it data like treasury bonds like the yield goes opt opposite the is to cut away. The spread out to be read that the odds are so. This is this was three I mean big. The guys in the patriots in this game to be a three point favorite of any NFC team. Please three point favorite of any and a CT right. I think of blacks like how all the game is going to date right there are trying to make it has yelled back yes. Right that propelled the blog site. The patriots. I but the odds are tied to your wedding I mean you got to put. Yet but right now without debate so basic. Oh forget the flat that is spread those who also pages. You know they've urged against. But obviously that's the case of your favorite I mean if you don't put money in a favorite like that. Then obviously. What they got it they got that they've got to get the they got it at the people's comfort. I gotta go what's your point I mean you trying to relate as anybody that's going on again. You're not you're talking about the spread you're wondering why why this spread salt wall ought to tell you what does that help law because everybody's floating. They've got to get. Party's right to organize not that it gases where it is using a laptop you're put through box down in like nine dollars. Right with a three point spread out on the take Atlanta make levels but it. Right regardless in this it's the odd that you're talking about that you're you're you're talking he has property called I don't know why this red cell law. All started over one call made a good point you expected to go up a couple points and in the next couple days. We get it out in Seattle so you don't get so. If you get everybody kind of called no weapon itself based on hot. Like the spread buck and change the law. Go what would you pick I keep waiting for you to give up I can't let. I would bet I bet the patriots are. If there's not a robot each team I think the paper's web. Thirty or are. Seventeen you know maybe a late field or touchdown or Bob Bartlett up it is eleven has two turnovers. Okay just don't source and I don't care what are still there are better look at it like it or art and. There are no matter iMac righty Matt Ryan is that the perfect and it to keep up need to keep up adding this is. Speak to put money down I'm not gonna put money on Matt Bryant and a perfect game against a Bill Belichick map treasurer on defense that has. An extra week to prepare for I just. I'm not gonna do. And you talk about ramble on all Baja. Paul's in Cambridge it's up well. They did it. I wanted to target this Ouattara both done what did you have blood lines point so. I I was informant to pick on just waiting for it to happen and laws and not OK fine that's why it happened lets you pick. You know and it didn't happen absolutely trying to tell Vanya. OK so. Maybe luck involved. It's going to be attract the patriots and score every possession Ryan probably were reopened action so like which in his. That thing swapping were people control. Clock control time of possession keep in mind not the field. Power running game you know like why he was shut down during Houston's drug that you and in that credit he uses sequence but things like that I. That we did you isn't so much in Pittsburgh game that the plot is only Keogh but I just like to keep ball control problem running a yacht was without that and that's when he great some not not been. You know just Lisa will hole. He's eight. Nine and yards. And so. I just want to opinion on that. Yeah I mean to be honest with this I had a game plan I have based on what just what I've seen. Is. You just talked about Brady being able to throw against Pittsburg. And and I felt that he was gonna be able to do baccalaureate and act game I told you that. And I feel. Even more strongly about that against Atlanta's pass defense is that Brady's going to be able to throw. Against Atlanta's defense. And will and I just I don't think he's gonna have any problem at all iffy guns. Atlanta's gonna need to do something in to give Brady. Some fits. To get him to throw some bad passes and and then come up with Terrell but again it's can Atlanta do that. Now. Like I told him in the last dollar that. Atlanta's defense has done some things defensively. To get the cornerback that impressed me with some of the big guys up front. Without having to send the house to get some and to get Rogers and and Wilson some fits but I just trust the patriots offensive line and the job that they've been able. To doom. And you go I Houston right. Did Davy and cloudy Whitney commercial is busting up the middle early in that game a little too much. Anybody's liking haren went. And that big of Tom Brady some Fitz did gotten his face they've forced predator throw some bad passes. What I didn't think is the game went on the patriots offensive line made some adjustments and they fixed the issue. And I think what are your shower and again against someone like clout. Especially when he came up the middle. Forget about coming on the outside either against shoulder cannon coming up the middle that seems to be where maybe if Atlanta's got to have success against the patriots opens a lot Bedford going to be out. It's a bust up the metal. But. What. I just think that the patriots have two weeks to prepare for this item they're gonna come up with shop and they're gonna use that Iran backs. You know to stab pop and maybe give even more protection for Tom Brady and the more protection of data because the longer Brady has now pocket there isn't anybody and that Atlanta's secondary that is gonna stop him. And that prevent Brady from economic pot I mean the falcons they lost their best cornerback. For the season I think that's a story line no one's talking about right Trufant. Give us back right in the secondary. All of these open season what do you have shirt he had surgery but a look at the he's playing in this scam to get better as a secondary that's bad in the first place. And better get to convert if they're gonna have a shot and give Matt Ryan a shot to keep up with him. They get to Tom Brady . And Mitt. I would you still put my money and the fact that's not gonna happen because. I think there are some factors in the last two games. That benefit Atlanta that won't benefit benefit them and this one I think the biggest one might be the home field. Home field advantage. I'm when he does not that I have got a three and I think that that's something that. Really help them out. Against Rogers and Wilson and the Seattle and Green Bay offense is they were affected by that noise they weren't they are affected by it by IBM  (WSJ) . The road team in a hostile environment this is not going to be a hostile environment. And Tom Brady is not going to be affected by any crowd noise and by being in any type of road team and somebody else's building an Atlanta certainly. You know they love planet all and they won't be at home next week and so I just don't think. They're going to be able to get to Brady and if they can't get the Brady they have no shot stop in. Brady from throwing the ball downfield and you talk about game plan ask me with a game plan a big day of did Tom Brady time of the pocket and he is gonna talk about this Atlanta defense 617779. 79837. Back at this time all. Hello there. Get a touch wood Danny right now 617 sevenths. We Saturday. Car fund sports real good. I'm back to your phone calls and then. Just a second but I'm written this on Twitter from the Steve Conroy the Boston Harold becomes the Bruins the Boston Harold Steve Conroy tweets. Brad marsh and has pulled out of the fastest skater competition. At NHL all star weekend skills competition is tonight at 7 o'clock in Los Angeles. My Shannon to grass kind of represented the Bruins Masha and according to Steve Conroy the Harold has pulled out of the fastest skater competition tonight he's believed to be nurse in some sort of walled. Body injuries are believed that in go to on the run away. The other night and then retirement. So he's got some sort of lower body injury. But he will compete. And met the line shooting competition so. Marcia and not in the fastest skater competition and I would say that if you honors in some type of injury even if it's just minor. Just some type of fights. Don't put yourself in that fastest skater competition we. The last thing the Bruins need is Brad marsh and. Damage himself. In the all star game skills competition. Now would know football this weekend I should say that we do a footballer of the for all tomorrow I have city of four point favorite I couldn't tell here. Who's in illusionist who. The quarterbacks I've no idea. Because you might think itself well we know the best quarterbacks in the league but they don't necessarily. Mean I'm talking about the guys who did make the Super Bowl obviously. They don't necessarily have to accept the invitation to play in the rubble you see all these two guys who reject. The invitation and they have to invite so many more players that actually selected for this day. So I always have a problem with the if you're Harris Indiana she's a four point favorite tomorrow night. Well I watch status that NHL all star damn I think I'll probably watch the NHL all star am. A little bit more only because they do owned they have three damn right they sort of in the semifinals. One team from each division I semifinal xenophile gam. Is it three on three till. It's round three right I think they'd they changed it a little bit the last couple years but. We have an extra weekend here at and pull another week next week. The breakdown suitable 51 patriots and falcons but for the time being on taken you up calls right now what you think is gonna happen in this one. A week from tomorrow and Houston 617779. 798370. Let's go to Bob in New Hampshire it's a body. OK. I don't guy. It certainly got into interior LB quick dump truck trucks are gonna go back and wrote two part question real quick ordering the militants are number one. I don't believe the neutral. You discriminate both offenses looked pedestrian I think it's going to be at the he turned to struggle. I'm actually look at middle school I noted but it looked in the high end but I'm looking at 1714. Caps. Only because Clinton are -- dollar check it. And Belichick knows Quinn. I think they're gonna try to take away what each other does well I think it's gonna come down the last five minutes about what order it's missed tackle. You know mr. Roberts spoke outrage so that it's back to may be in a field goal. That's like personnel when I hear what you -- to think about I'm looking at lowland gorilla electorate -- 1714. Maybe 1410. And my other question has caught on with his injuries. We know kind of injury Lila thought. He's the most awesome tight end in the league but you know -- gotten bigger players collapsed -- I just I didn't mean to do that I'd aiming to do that body I had about an accident. I didn't mean to do that starred Bob I I I cut you up by action that's on me. Call back and if you get a chance he would Bob calls back Dave I just I was wipe my hand over the strain I had bought by accident but I wit with regards to go wrong. I think I don't need all that. And net is my take on it well when it comes to Rob Gronkowski is a businessman you're right. On the patriots handled a football team like a business as well. I think Rob Gronkowski. Is without question. The most dangerous. Tight end that I have ever seen in the history of the league honestly yes. But that said. Well. Not the brunt warned me room for the patriots. Mr. ball is obviously gonna group the Richards but if the patriots and it are you gonna wanna shoot the ball and I'll run. I did you know when it comes time to. For the business side of it along the injury it's. Well it's crazy to think that may be Bill Belichick isn't gonna give grind. What you want toward Drew Rosenhaus whose agent. Would want to grow and both sides handle it. Like a business. Than I could see and I could envision. Both sides not being close honestly that it is how I envision it now could they end up work and something out. Perhaps I would I hope they can't. IA I think that I think you know we got a couple years for that even be a conversation. I clear that we know all that Rob Gronkowski based on the tweet that he had on the patriots picked up his option which I believe picked up you know four years of pride for you at four more years and a deal. Don't you just drew that tweet out there. Because he was completely joking around like I do feel like it was a method to the madness of debt tweet okay. Because we do know he's a businessman but. To be honest with ya like from meteorite now widow crime. Ticket to get into especially where his contract isn't even up for me to get into a Rob Gronkowski contract. Argument the line. To really sit there and spent too much time on that I just that's not anywhere close to be in on my radar. I think if there is a story line of someone who's not gonna play him is damn. We have maybe that would be a little bit closer. Moderate that would be grapple and maybe what his future because at a garrote all plays and that is based on the fact that. Yup she's in this success that Tom bradys have. And I don't believe Tom Brady is just gonna fall off a cliff like Max element might want him to after this year. Berg said the result that is. Again there's a reason why the pitcher it's her favorite already to win actually is suitable. So next you'll be the last year or drop below steal I think that's a much more timely story line and that would be on my read off a little bit more than any type of grunt and what grunts futuristic the patriots. Brunch futurist heal up get back to register at some point and she would you can do what Brady at quarterback but of Rob Lowe is still here and he's a backup. I like I look at this coming offseason. And I think to myself. I when it comes to plays on this team and moves that the patriots could make big moves. I think you'll look back problem because. There are teams. But you just saw the final fall in the NFL. Brady Roethlisberger. Rodgers Ryan you've got to have a quarterback in this league to be successful. There'll lot of teams in this league that don't have a quarterback there it seems initially a lot of them that have tried multiple options whether it's. Trade draft. Crazy signings like Houston get an Oz while a fortieth 72 million dollar deal and none of it's worked out form right. So. The names that are going to be looked at Tony romo's name people I've got a call Dallas. And I got to see what AA what's gonna take that to take Tony Romo off stance because the actress got is the guy in Dallas. Romo is going to be available if you Bill Belichick . Yeah I'll maybe create some type of bidding war. Because what would blue would you rather have would you rather have Rob Lowe. What's he gonna be 27 are up on X you believe I believe he's 26 years Greg Robb was point six. Toll road all is going to be 37 I believe in April and the sprint I was at an update this the other day. And Mitt. So would you rather have through the triple drop or guys is all that and Tony Romo who has won anything in this league. Other than some regular season games. I mean I'd rather spend it. You know some some draft pixel oil trade shifts on on a guy who's in his twenties Joost revive its 25 going to be 26 next. Or so ago I mean I'd rather have dropped obviously Kenny is on him. Why did appellate judge you throw a rock wall and in these two tick the tie is because debt and that you don't like Rob Lowe control his own desk. This is a free agent I shown embraced a plan at a high level and this is the way I want I don't know onset and how Belichick can play at I'm telling you what I would. IA. Want telecheck. To embrace Brady's career and say we're gonna stick operating as long as we can what I can award about the backup quarterback because when Brady is gone. This isn't gonna what the sand we are Derek going to be years where we gotta have finally feel. What it's like to not be in the AFC championship. And I think what you have Brady now plan at a high level you know. Do you roll attack which means if you drop although the patriots got a role Brady you don't wanna be back up. I can't help ensure might love the patriots organizational love bill village tackle might want to be the patriots quarterback at some point in your career after Brady. Don't wanna sit around and wait any longer after this deals up you wanna go somewhere restart cubic. And especially. After he just put his skills on display. Earlier this season. So you'll like Rob Lowe. Make his own decision on that I'd I'd think. You know. At least if umbrella checked that's what I would do but that's storyline to grapple store economy to the future of grappled verse to future Brady and the patriots organization committee. That's a much more timely storyline to storyline that would be on the migrate. A little bit more that any type of Gradkowski. Situation because he is under contract sure he's yeah I he has these injuries. Bud. When he is on the field Durbin did is he can't you can't but I don't I don't grunt grunt and appealed their credit did. But it wanting to Victor it's approved right now is that they have built an offense that is able to. Still put up big numbers evil and out rock and a big reason that is the guy. Who's on dissent Tom Brady Tom Brady and Bill Belichick act regardless of any of the moves as long as those two guys around him this ship. The patriots are going to be one of the best teams in the AFC and a gonna have a shot to get at Super Bowl and bowl will take blob is back Bob's column back. I'll put a mind and Bashar about that I hit the button by accident that's my fault. Continuing to dot on ground. They. Hey yeah I don't ansari had today I heard a thing at the higher I would listen to you can't match I totally agree with eagle putt to drop opium highest point on the radar right now. It is a young curious what you thought about blunt where you know we missed a lot of playtime and stopped that saw what I do agree 100% above that I grew up lol I think you sized point my other part of the question was as simple bloke I know it's going to be in -- -- on I think it's gonna I think it's gonna they are both offenses kind of pedestrian I think it's going to be a defense of struggle that's my personal and I think it's going to be a low scoring affair I really built for some reason I think Quinn not knows Belichick Belichick knows Quinton and they're both gonna take away it would each try to do well. I don't think it's going to be much in the running game I think it's gonna come out the last five minutes outlook quota. I don't currently we are you re appeared on this week I just I want you finish your ground you ground the I know you are you at a at a hot take on ground had I didn't want and yet. Yeah I know I again I love the Crocker and now my my biggest lies we not dollar check it's sort of players collapse you know what I'm saying is. So I'm glad I'd love disputed Clark's Iran and I don't see him and not Martellus. You know you know you book to book ends up. Now I would show I would still I don't think gaga moved broad at least they should remove grind. But added that's his ID so I think the garage story line has some been for a couple years down the road you know I'd I don't think I only got distort my friend ever again it's. It's Super Bowl week anything to be a story I've got to make anything and everything a story line and everything that patriots related. And anything that might be related to a. Possible. Disconnect would kill bella Jack people are gonna jump all the nuts and it is a disconnect there but somebody might try to. Connect those pieces bronco always be in NJ degree Ron grows and oust the contract telecheck the way he plays it might try to do that may. Not really on my radar right now 61777979837. 61777979837. More recalls of there's time all. Patriots dot com. Easy access oxy to all fair game. We're getting her card on Sports Radio WEEI. I wrapping up the second hour of the shell on Intel I 6 o'clock or Paula called it a few minutes ago just. Ramble on on he begins a call tell me I rambled on he rambled on about the odds for the patriots to win the suitable we know they're the favorites when the show global. And he's like tweet me nonstop with a link to the odds as of. January 16. Anyway it's like why you sent me a blank if you're really wanna keeps enemy lengths you donkey you want he's Seminole and that's up to date. Anyways we all know what's going on what the odds dine and that is super ball ghetto life. That's another thing out tonight. I don't like. Sub tweet me. Just blanks. Between me something good. We get I had I can go to espn.com. I can goal to all these web site unseen audience he's the favorite C you are the best chance Felicia bond edit. We gotta we gotta put something on top of that. You put it having a talk aren't. Well man. Some people just need I don't like six or 777979837. Let's go to Jay in Randolph would subject. I hire you good so borrowers. Its Internet. Goodell did not belong on the things he did so because group now epic. But in its workers and perhaps support a political race and the department. So I don't they are Britain belongs in the end and then. If you would what a god that we're Richards. Our our hope that you stop and these forward in mop up. Average federal government's help and I had that there are pretty sure it Omega my daughter. So I don't they bring the lament and contribute greatly when he opened flat out of or breakthrough at bigger let down chop. Well I mean I that's get in the hole not a discussion you you talk about. Tom Brady's seniors comments. And it I'd we have audio of Tom Brady senior I believe they'll planet. The previous show train at the moxie but you know when it comes the Tom Brady  Bill Belichick act and their relationship with Donald Trump whatever that relationship may be in the fact that. Date they say they have a friendship and and Brady says that you know he doesn't. Support every single view that the guy has just because their frenzy as the sport every single view. I will tell you this about. Patriots fans who maybe don't support Brady and the patriots because of that relationship. And there are a lot more people that aren't they might. They might not support the fact that Tom Brady is friendly. Donald Trump but I think most people feel like I still watch him and still I gotta root for the patriots a week from tomorrow ashes to feel Idec. I don't care what anybody. Once stood to write about it in personal stories of people they know who won't watcher and Alaska oil and natural right to make that decision. And opera for the patriots on talent is I think there are still a lot of people. And that most people who aren't they might not like the fact that Brady bella checked. Have a relationship with Donald Trump I pick most people who don't like that we'll still watch and root for the patriots. Village in Springfield it's uphill. Any I want to tell you got a great so are there any talk sports is very important. This is sports now I have a great idea I don't know can make the Colombo are coming. Why has it do that when we only take you and puts you in the morning show. What Jerry does count and get ruined by minute that it should be a movie critic. I talked about it anomalies. He season jogging is not about what. I thought you wanted to did you just calling and saying you wanted to talk sports and that's a good thing. So why don't why are you going to. I would opt out about current crop until I think you contradicted yourself and I got I was confused. Regardless salad is lying and many are not that audience. This is my show is right now I'd opponent might show so give me something that you wanna talk about did you just call them the gimmick called saint. You would rather talk to you like that I talked sport so glad. OK Clark went warp 540. Tight and inside that's that he can attest to that can't play too deep to get. And Brady has the ability to conduct becomes faster on the outside out negotiate up from the outside. Got better angle on it. One right down the middle and so on so tight end. It the hard or put on Brady puts it right on the money. Looking you people go crazy about going up while there he's played a game and perhaps you might be just like Romo injured girl. What a and that one I used to pocket about. What is taught what's going on right now what are you trying to show you know the rocket engine right there is not a lion of the short ball. Right and I sort of like. They're not much right on all of. Talking about trading drunk who would say. Some of RadioShack. Well just this ready to show you can't say. Like well I tarts pop it's an open what got anything that you generally talk about. Rondo went deep on the middle of the field the patriots play in the show all week from tomorrow rob doesn't Clint. I don't a lot of people talking about trading right if they not admitted to find some battles to talk about because I I don't I don't get that one. That's not may we call. Earlier who brought up brawn can I do as I said in a lot that's not a big rock story line is not a moderate his final he op plan a week from tomorrow that's when I don't. Like ya as remote things that I know I know he's not plant and I also know the patriots. It's still gonna roll on Atlanta's defense without is that a knock on drug of course not a knock on rock. But I think it says a lot of all Tom Brady and this season he's Avant. Also says a lot about the offensive line think back last year at this time what we were don't. We are talking about the patriots. Watch in the Broncos watching Peyton Manning and the Broncos go to the Super Bowl . Why does the patriots offensive line was banged up. And they were a puddle to graduate healthy could get the job done you got the job that Dante Scarnecchia has done with this group that is not healthy back implant. You know top notch opera sublime football right now this is a group that is blocking for quarterback that is having an MVP type season. There's no court incidents that right now that the Patriots offense is Roland. Into the Super Bowl and last year. You know they got stopped in their tracks and Brady was hit it. And he was drone picks and it was spot in the broncos' field position and it may Peyton Manning in that first half look like the best quarterback in football he wasn't even close. All comes back to what's going on for. And at a dose of stored and traded on. Like what you thought what do people pocket of what's going on there if you're shipment today wake up well what the patriots are gonna do it rock. And you gotta. You gotta find something to do you need to find a hobby because that's not a top story on. On my radar had minted its rubles 6177797907617. 7797. 9837.

Think we need to have it adds up to fiddler reiterated Sunday his. But I mean I'm you know I'm I don't stuffy suck up the something's on on on line but. I mean if you can produce evidence where rice are up in the area of the read this was a apiece chip appearance on the bubbly showed Kirk Callahan show this week he was against the casting doubt which I guess rear admiral may soon be as well he was it's extended the invite as yeah it sounds like Jerry Ara asked asked me to be on I'd be bought and happiness to the cast and coached that's big stuff as causes a decisive when that's and you pointed out but at the.

Get the feeling he's now I don't believe they've actually gone up till now literally sick jewel in your outward as a coach not a mystery. I don't you believe that. Day appears to have reached a crossroads now where they decided to let this thing play out for the couple weeks that the all star break here. The schedule really stands out of the next three weeks and in six games you Bruins. In the next couple weeks including that by a week. So we'll see how things shuffle out and how some teams around the standings that reacts and at that point they're gonna have two choices coaching change or trade. Reyes actually to throw three choices. You know not yet stand pat right but I don't see that happening so. It's possible that the writings on the wall and Juliet feels it is giving your response I. I can guarantee right now and I know who's gonna get fired Mike Babcock in Toronto I don't. It's it's happened and it's gonna happen I don't know when it political I would your advice is kind of fight it's brought those to just sit and wait a sentiment says it away. Exactly IA Nina we talked about a last week ET and always getting as fighting and that happened two months later that's not having a school beauty you you might have taken gas medio hassle us intelligence on the aren't fighting kept on. I think the bronze if anything it. And asked them Brad my son's quotes him. It feels like the marriages like most solidified now than it was a few weeks ago. I mean I I don't get the sense that. There's no place and you need is no players drop in quotes maybe. You know author racquet stop the guys I mean I'm sure one or two guys bitches but it pitches to a media guide but there's nothing ultimate. That that is any indication he's last the team it was in the Roman Mino except for the fact that in Los four in a row when the rumors were swirl right while the cause that they go hand in hand you know the blues and then you know. One prominent guy in town says he's it's gonna happen based on his got them right does that mean that there was not you know I mean. Almost all lost source is this a course that I think about it you know they talk to this Arianna gonna take a look at well of course that's what management but even Bobby Kielty you know of the most respected guy am I right media had yet I commented on last week right Biden and he's hot he's one guy who where'd you do actually abide by and he did have that it was a strong disconnect. And you know now is that this connects. Is it still I mean again I just hope and outweighed a fight or months on the Arab file for some. He's an Allen knew what when they gonna Firefox right now I mean the everyone of the five games and games I I think close. I'm surprised he's here in the but I think editing. You run a Marcia and I think the players the veterans on this team it's genuine they wanna cup with this guy they obviously have some up in a degree of up close this with Julian but. That doesn't mean it's the time has come work could provide a spark here down the stretch but he you look at this this break they have now look come back. And they'll take on Tampa on the road Washington the good team and in Toronto again who they've been scope by twice you brought up but Babcock and the leafs. If you really are honest about it please clarify I was totally joking of course OK according Toronto's a blast but right now that if you give them. If you extrapolate the points based on having five games in hand on the Bruins Toronto is going to make the postseason with a very young roster. And it be if that happens indeed beat out the Bruins that's tough that's three years general you missed the playoffs and you know you could argue and I think I would they had a better roster than. All three years on paper then all three to teams that they would be out by Philadelphia one year this year would be it would be too raw. Or Philly again but you know I I think you've just got to remember this bill wildcats won Emmy and a couple months you'll look like them for the government to plot was gonna have. 5 teams in the am but true that's true they've fallen off Philadelphia and Boston both have 56 points Bruins to a two games in hand. That's you know that's it it is potentially four points the Philly but. I mean I I consider the groans in the thick of it is is much as any any of these the other teams at the bottom. Again hypothetically if they if they miss the playoffs again you know I just I'd rather deal with out we get together and I just kind of fact I would be the same drum over and although like with load. As you know is he got a goal is he gonna go like Al and I take all out weekend manually. I suppose because you are clearly had a little bit the act arrogant and yeah and me that they'd they'd won into the break. Pretty good one and that Detroit team it's a team they should probably be easily. They would Downey battled back they showed them some got a little bit of spirit since in Pittsburgh down to nothing they come they come battled back. And the break is probably a perfect timing I think too close look album titled he has a man nearly shop. As he was earlier in the year and I think this is a well timed break fund and knowing that. Couple guys and ended its base including took it might be in DNA about Jesus you'll connect. I think they caught about orchid nobody's gonna start Tuesday in Tampa because they call them up because in Mac and I can't play during the all star break column up because duke is gonna fly cross country and Staples Center in middle it and play Tuesday. After a lot Tripp lied and they wait. Because they need Zain MacIntyre province that's why column mop mine tanning odd and I bet he'd better and better investor wise potato chips that we gets it oral and those of those that she's balance. Yet available. These currently. Actually obviously cheese there that day and it Korean barbecue too I like those few big chip guys and I mean you can't be wise chips. We're up for. That'd by wise snacks of course one of our fine sponsors SR market NE TNT to Saturday's game I can't Laird forever from Parcells sports is here at Tai Anderson our beat man from the BI dot com is still walking in here. As we speak but yet we should give you know little focus only games this week the Pittsburgh game. After getting skunk five to one and being dealt to nothing. In the first period goal is to intermission break. I bet you up plenty of television's clicking off or two other channels across new wings Sunday Pittsburgh game yeah okay I'd yup. Yeah it was ugly yes it after a period one Thursday night it felt. Pretty low for this. It was one of those you know the wheels turning again in. The responsible was what it was semi I know Pittsburgh was missing mob and the whenever guys are hard always miss on different teams. I yelled they showed tremendous I'd come back and in the got a little hairy late but. If full points going into the break they can recharge the batteries I think like as a result of a very well timed break for this team. I think to Gore's looked a little ragged maybe tiger give us Lamar insight yet. How would he tell you that this is a good time for the break for the Bruins to a little little a little when the missiles maybe what. But I'm content with its high fire appeared on the date a date producer. Like on. We got lost adversary I had it on Larry it's going to killer yet know the break is totally the right time this team and they look exhausted. And and they were you asked questions like that like not our fine everything's fine they're going to Yad now lead a break and set up that was fun announced it's telling it's true. Sixty on 153 game two games I mean that's essentially out and wants more than anybody else in the and the league dads that's not that this at this stage in the year I think and and seventeenth two win these games against good competition. Given all of that given the circumstances is very difficult so. You know they came through at some with some big wins but but yes this was sort of like. You watch that that Pittsburgh game on Thursday and you say they're not and as such as to nothing like the teams gaffes they're just they're they're they're ready for the break he needed they need to press. You know that the reset button there. And and fired back up on Tuesday but they've they pull it out and I mean I can't think of a better way to end what has any trying for two games the Nat win. It sums this team up and and angry when you ready Europe to cast them and not pay attention again they pick him up with a is definitely like that godfather part three aspect is that in the that's fine it is it's that is that the only thing that people remember from the godfather appropriate thing is you know just might think despite being a mile yeah neglect and out. That that none of them hilarious miscast in about Sophia Coppola will marsh in almost didn't play in the game. Yeah ends up being a star did you know is always on knocked out of its in the first period right and what happened that even thought about that he be helped on the runway after one. Collision with a plea was Ian Cole. I wanna say of the of the of the penguins there look at his lower body and then. Come to find out he pulls himself out of the fastest skater competition tonight right so that would it lead you to believe that yes there is something lower body going on there. On the eyes that he is you know hobbling out there and and this is them playing and playing it safe and not risking our penal Marcia not risking the team's best player getting hurt and what is and other. Arenas but some minutes and meaningless weekend of of of fun and activity doesn't mean we understand that but I think it's a Smart by him but again I mean. He should imply. He should be suspended and I really think that he should be suspended for that at mean that is just. That's old that's old Brad that's like that's what you thought you getting 2011. Before he was stabbed himself as a goal scorer before its options ovals one of the best players in this league on here's a need to do that's. You get why he did it because if you look if you if you watch it out ten seconds earlier. The Bruins think. Kron wall slew foot Bergeron so they're they're pissed about that scrolls been a type of player through guy it's everyone from behind these guys are tough guy that comes in I think that's I didn't spend much because schools crumble if there's. It was Zetterberg Odom ended up. I mean and I'm kind only half joking because he NHL is so political and I'm not totally I mean does it. They've gotten better in the discipline but annual global get to the NHL undulating but they're more indications are politically has but. I thought the schori was gonna get at least to gain. You know based on its slow foot and it's my shot these as a reputation he has corrected. I thought for sure at least a game. 101000 qualifier I was like well I'll take it but it's it's not like you know Tyson it's a movie if you think he's past the he used to do a lot more dirty stuff I mean once in a blue moon maybe but. Us a slow footed on a guy like from all its dangers dangers move you can really you can really hear. One of the things I find interesting about it too is that yet to remember crumbles missed. Since the calendar year to a sixty at the cardinals missed almost like forty games is injuries. So they're looking out the red and we're doing what you do and this guy you know this guys on one knee basically you're doing this so it was when they called it dangerous trip. Is dangerous and more than one way and is that the whole thing was with danger zone is unnecessary it was reckless and what I liked about it was marsh and owned it. In on the Bruins owned after the game. You know quotes that we were lucky to have them before the game marsh and says it that was stupid none Nasr on my part I think that shows you the difference now. Verses were eleven the last year to rightly get suspended the he now he always Jones and afterward as you ever seen I've never seen a human more upset. To watch a hockey game than Brad marsh and the press box winter classic you can see us faces like. And I really goofed up he he knew it and and it means that. You know that that you recognize them that's the that's wonderful but you don't want it on me because again he's going to be gone for probably you're talking 510 games at least because they've already let. I'm off the hook but this one well Ankiel adamant and even that gained you know he ties up the centers overtime Tuesday against Detroit. Out to credential wise snacks or sponsor when we select now or cheese doodles extreme player of the week brought to you by lies next is it marsh and Dora. Which give it to love. I struck Haiti with the overtime winner Tuesday. Or you know Thursday they had to have David back is showing up at a big point -- to be my pick. But that's kind of the quintessential David back this game if you're gonna now bring him and that's what you wanna see from him you levels fatality love you love all all like little iiroc. He was an impact the guy right now violence in that game. He created. But still factor which led to and they scored the game winner on a power play goal. You know with Colin Miller dropped the gloves but what's his name for Pittsburgh Scott Wilson yes the instigator penalty. It's Backus. Thrown checks all of the ice which sort of created and it I think that's a real don't you think it's a real tangible effect and that in game like that. No was I I go back to marsh and more though because I look at the situations. In which he contributed I think one of the big things was. In other down to nothing after one there to begin the period on the on the PK. I've Pittsburgh on for what really would have been the the just the apps that dagger three nothing it's map Marie guys stone you all season long. On and martians go to shorthand goal I get some back on the board. You know in many contributes with with a five on five goal later in the period and I think that was kind of one of those things where. You know what Pakistan was wonderful and I and I don't want discredit all because aid without that I don't think the Bruins aren't as it physically engages anywhere. But I just look at what marsh and did and that second period really get them going that's shorthand goal I think was really a pac bring it for the penguins he went from. Possibly being up three nothing especially given the weapons at their power play house to being hit it to make it to one game and now the Bruins they feel there and feel that. Their heart sold ars are going that's frankly I like Backus there. But I I I have to go marsh and I got to get on the marsh and fan boy I'm I am a martian apologists in the first to admit it. Well sure you get to can't nearly century nearly suck up as we established who's you'll break tie here. Fees two losses but the I'd bash he had no doubt about it he had two goals and Stan. Straight games to one of them they'll Pittsburgh and fourth or cracked the twenty goal barrier once again has Korea. It's no no brainer if I mean him grab much if the rules it's its interest Selig a year ago at this time it there was discussion about whether or not he was going to be signed long term you have to Bosnia all of the rumor can -- later gonna go to Pittsburgh right. My guess there're several. Theories but. There anybody guarantees that I don't speak guarantee that the lessons are not now you say AP do you think it. All. W in it those are two types so of wins. They teach you again reinvested in the team or at you know out I would think maybe maybe not maybe. Two and a half years it toyed with your emotions do much but you're gonna want to see what they do now against Tampa Toronto Washington bill. Indeed beef. It extended season of believability at least for a little bit. Rick I would reel that back in just a little bit. Yep look at these two ends and Kate I'm only be human be doomsday or don't you're Gallup poll rightly goes who do the red wings committed downright don't have lark and organic their their two best wingers is here for the most part. And I think you look at some of the match ups that that the red wings had against Charlie that night. And in large and you know he's he's tougher matchup for char the night quizzes I think that's something that that would have. Would have helped the wings a lot more and then you look at Pittsburgh. They come in let's hangs out Balkans out horn quizzes plant less a 100% in the three big guys trend that those are three guys that really help them. That that help them in the cup last year and continue be juggernaut this year so. I think to reel it in just a little bit put at that given day it's points and that's what this team needs that need points they need to win. ID need to stay afloat these these games play they are gonna catch up the team is. You know they do realize that Julien did make mention again today which kind of surprised because he's sort of been focused on the task at hand and not looking behind a relic and head. But I but I do you think that he mentioned that Haywood we need is finally swing games and hope that a game like like Thursday like Tuesday. Can be something to build off of but it's tough to it's tough to fully buying the steam because every time you know like you guys that. Every time you get a read on them. They just they lane nag and I'm fully expect in the Ned to lose for a one attempt today and and. Look emotionally. And interest at all game one all the Super Bowls on everybody's mind and just thinking about if if they don't make the playoffs this year. That's three years in a row doesn't happen very often put the sports teams in this town Celtics haven't missed the playoffs three user Olson's pitino. Was around in nearly 2000 as the patriots haven't missed the plant's three years in a row since 1993. While so. Is Ross salary caps for several different you know Ottawa do lows like phony cliche sports talk radio topics or whatever but. It just if you miss it three years of oral something's gonna happen with this franchise right aid it's. That's unacceptable with this roster at some of the guys we're talking about here marsh and for a second year room having a great year and you hate to waste those. When their spending to the cap and the owner is already strolled down the gauntlet so there is a lot at stake here if they don't. Put together a streak of some kind they won't get back. Into the playoff picture in their own pace radiate points right now you guessed it last week as probably not good enough. Yep does that does a Lotto. A lot of hockey man I mean there's so many teams that can fault I'm in the Philadelphia Flyers I don't think they're built the last panel Mason's playing pretty well this year but. I mean of why is you don't let them somewhere in the same category as them I think it. It's easy to going to be the Bruins and flyers who get him out of those two is a big Toronto's and I think it's funny Montreal Ottawa and Toronto. And the Atlantic three team via thought it was a stunner tonight I do not expect this but I think you're right it's it's hard depiction of faltering now their hand and then you know on and then they get that done I mean they lost Greg Anderson when he went to join his wife would issue suffer cancer in the table tenants held up fought that. It definite surprise to me but. Eight photos date date could be the one falter and you know like it'll open a slot there you know this the by the way the Bruins Italy played them once they of three meetings with the senators left. And they you know they they have. Its sphere of success for us auto I auto loans normally you dragged on a I'm but the abroad got thirty games left a lot of other teams have mostly around 3435. Games left. The but this is so much hockey left anything can happen guys injuries are still gonna happen to guys guy's gonna fall I mean the the Bruins they might get distanced little. I'll break here Mike and urged him a little better Jewish exactly what they need and they still have doubt that I week two rates. The data elements and that's out forever forever is a light schedule right. But if you look at it realistically they have to probably win a close to 666. Winning percentage it is to get in there and that's going to be difficult but I think at the same time they have a pretty. Pretty good schedule and late late February early march where it's a lot of bad teams let teams that are kind of where you are. I deem you should win historically strong match ups things of that nature. Here's the thing now and his Hendrick people crazy and now. This team is gonna stay the course for the third year earlier and stay the course they're not gonna make a drastic change for everything I've gathered it's it's. They've they still think that there's untapped potential with this team last year they were buyers you say so yeah course the it will I don't mean they're out in the got to revamp the coaching on the gonna fire the coach I think they're gonna. Make a massive deal for Gabriel and Scott because. Or are Mac machine I don't see it because they don't wanna give up any of the pieces that they have earned pieces that are coming in the next two years. I think they'd be valued Brent are lol lot. They obviously died Charlie Mack voice and inaccurate is going to be unbelievable acting right away. They don't wanna move these guys and and it makes sense because. I sort of think that your Landis got away from winning the cup I I think your problems are deeper and and and which he could be one away from making the playoffs. Of course yeah but our our we are you in the idea of of mortgaging more of the future for for right now for the second round I mean I think that they've done yes watching that. 'cause they've got marshy and in Bergeron and they still have Chara and Backus its its signal that they have guys that it's a screen they were built to win now. What you just gonna punt to wait wait for Charlie Mack wood to develop because it's you can't do that. And now accident is a lot of teams that don't take him five years to be he'll be in the league probably the next couple years five years to be an established proven. What superdome and Rachel's let them I think I think Aaron iCloud as a guy that out of the people I mean I don't wanna compare Mac when the number one overall pick but. I think that this NHL is built for god Mac avoid now vs where it was five years ago or doggie Hamilton Ian about two years before he was really dodgy Hamilton. I just think the way the game is turning out the speed skating . The quick decision with the puck I think it would would. Allow Mac what is stepping in India a top four guy he's parrot the right player. You know this case being Chara. And you put Carla down in the second pairing their I think you have a base there and I know it I know it's Sox but you don't want to. I just think you don't wanna become the flames you don't wanna be this team that is constantly. Mortgaging the future. And then signing veterans the same time in saying all we get and that's good. You wanna see your young guys grow I think into what they are in and I hate the idea of this team trading for. A defend a veteran defenseman or veteran third line fourth line player. And telling me hey you know for trial's going to be in this role now is enough power play AI Colin Miller is going to be this and the defense now heat that ideas what happened last year didn't work out. I want here's a trade rumbled into coming up next it's. Making the the rumor mill and another report from Elliot Friedman about the future of Julian and the Bruins are what they're thinking so there are some couple reports on that as we head to the all star break here in the NHL skills competition tonight touch on that a bit. Rear admirals hear from Marshall sports. I Anderson is covered liberals for WEEI dot com until Laird Saturday's game with until 730 were brought to you by AT&T star market and why stacks Sports Radio W yet. You're listening to Saturday skeet with a rear admiral and can layer on Sports Radio WEEI. Ideas ready for the latest in the rumor mill. Man on the theory. Are you just from Elliot Friedman as some action from a day that's Claudia and do you not the no Alley it's easier aliens I don't have these teams Canadian three or four that you know in these days I'd gospel but it's it's definitely trustworthy and it's not made up like. Some of the medium you would trump trusts like two BD guys each so Obama put a little put Elliot freed military leaders and that's if yes. Here's a quick quick from LA he says can you fight an item. Three I says quote Boston Bruins GM Don Sweeney would rather make a trade first the see if that changes things for the Bruins as opposed the firing head coach Claude Julien . Wow that sit there the doors to the point now. This was a point four hours ago things are obviously changed it pretty quickly aides admit this I think actually this is before the other whenever Pittsburgh anyway. Sweet little rat would rather make each trade first to see if that changes things. If they. Continue this pattern of the you know win win one lose one counted are there a couple weeks. And he makes a trade. Who we go after one of the trade rumor guys that's been out their for this is dawn. At least a year prop probably to Dubai and now two and half is Kevin Shanker the defenseman from saint Louis blues. Boston University guy. Connecticut native I think by the key group in New York keys them deputies he grew up in New England per say but anyway he's 47 he's gonna be on restricted free agent at the end of the year. And the Bruins keep coming up on the list of teams that could possibly be chat or so let's say Friedman's right. And Rick before they get the bye week instead of firing Julian they go for the trade Andy bring in 27 year old Kevin Chet walker Colette and goals this year. Offensive defenseman right top four guy at least may be a top pairing guy. They give up some young players. Not sane is gonna be back aboard Carlo but. One of the prospects draft picks. Is that a good move is that a deal that could spurt in Bruins. To some success at least get a little playoffs more so the coaching change. He needs to know what the deal is before you can judge hypothetical trade I mean it. With prospect would play from the ross' that would that would traffic beef weak and can say okay I'll I'll do that and then even then he you know and you gotta you gotta wait for a trade to play out I mean. You know you can't judge trade before it gives me you don't call what is immense even buy a monthly U campuses but what he gambled and trade that trade does that take. Probably five at least five more years to determine who won that trade would you agree. Are you Hamilton trade probably needs five years this LK somebody definitively one this trade dedicated yourself to see if if Hamilton is a real. Neil and and frankly without you know a fellow top pairing guy next to him obviously anybody work on Hamilton at this point in pretty good. But. They Hamilton did deal by the way the Bruins got Saxon nations still in the OHL right up. On an up Gerri mean you know was on wheels on him he's really got he's an aggregate and forced back to Carlson. Who is also very good at present be assigned to the arrest those guys are still is a bar was there a natural peck write rights of oral. He was the thirteenth yet he's the first pick of the three in a row that they had some moral to browse consideration. I just sounds. For some reason I wanna say that. To borrow one was the LA kings but I I could be totally wrong yet trap was very nasty yet Argentina and elect on on that we. Right that was the Mark Jones street they got some more yeah yeah yeah as we teach India and out was really teach yen but it's confusing go to Shatner Kirk. After remember the price at the draft drinking it in the blues wanted to David Foster knocked in all of Boston's first tropics. Which is insane to ask terrible deal oh my goodness what a horrible for especially for a guy who is you have to instill you have made in the year on so considerate you know. Considering that fact IE I don't trade this guy I would why would you get of assets and and and picks if you think you have a chance again him as a free agent. He's the only way to do it is victory sign that already yeah that would be an Ottoman EU half trade extent yes some kind of agreement now because he played could be used their chance that. He might be. The vibe that Clark writes it's hard to think that guys who already get free agency is committed to sign beetle to Mosul was to be your connection. What's that that he plays got some Boston can and all that stuff. That doesn't add that I'm mad as I mean when you have a kid needed one or college at gateway dad they want to be you all may be elbit these guys are college for a year or two whatever that. They have ties friends emotional but that does not factor in like web. But because what a college somebody you wanna play the professional guy walking tablet that plus a lot of money it until it got that if you see the ago but yeah there's no I mean. Did its Alley all I want that I've I've played every year to Altria. And that doesn't affect these guys decision here's a theory theoretical trademark it is the Bruins have Ryan Spooner that could be available. If they get the extension done and include a prospect likes of oral. Maybe you could work something Gallup blows from Saint Louis is point of view their hang around playoff picture themselves. They have to better defenseman. In their mind if the tree Angelo bought Easter so this is their third best the federal laureate Colton corporate history of getting me easy if you had a extensively replaced Chad card you know in an Alley but I don't. And they're gonna lose at the end of the year so if you the blows. You you're willing to make a deal right yeah I mean that that could end up having to go to a popular hockey trade possibly you know to like team that he's defensemen. Team that is a fall wooden and not even have any future ramifications could be epic UUF if you if they swap which you know not asset with a not necessarily with the Bruins. But you know just two teams with equal needs and OK you don't wanna lows of an optimal while all right amount for the rest of the year you know I think I would do that deal now missed some Bora but I don't know what he's projected to become. I mean I think of the three I think he's. The least likely to succeed I just now you keep Carlo you keep yeah hackable Lleyton and you know your goal in fort shorter tenure in this theoretical billiards you chat Kurt now part of your infinite it's like a teams are. On of the fact that the Bruins and wanting would wanna ditch the boy world I think of of all their defensemen. This morals god that I that gets thrown out there are a lot and I think teams accountable why. You know I don't think so girls and a ceremonies great skater I think his decision making as little and at times. I do you think he takes resolve opposition gets caught wondering quite a bit these. Granted I've only watched him to the rosy years and few camps and if you pre season games so maybe I'm wrong and he's as great defenseman in the Q but from what I've seen. I think of all this all the defense for the Bruins happening at that time I think that he is the the least likely to make it here that makes any sense be it. Because betrayed Kirby because he doesn't crack the lineup. So I would do the deal. If if let's say is that it would the Loral Loral Spooner of morals Spooner and an epic that you're gonna have to throw first pick in the first round pick in there to see. Yeah bulls pumas value they've they've pissed that away but completely. Yeah I mean the good thing going the going rate for dilation and Kurt typically is a top prospect. Roster player suffers from panic I mean that's that that's the baseline and I don't see that's a lot. I I don't like him I don't see and his team trained for Kevin Chad currently involved in defense of help they have sort of on the horizon. I won't really I don't know I don't know whether gonna go and bring a guy and put. That kind of a contract on these great player and it's not really about jagr just. I don't they does to have a lot of pots and placed on the wall chart is gonna be gone in it right a year but and most means so would you say he's your veteran replacement for. I don't I just it just doesn't seem like a tree the Bruins would make this is is there a conservative organization it's not again it's not a dis Blanche to Shaq guard. Great player which is it just doesn't seem like the type deal the Bruins make. Any trade they do make to a big trade wouldn't would likely involve them moving one of McQueen or Kevin Miller as well. They they would like to get rid of one of those contracts if they're gonna ask it if they're gonna make a deal. The problem is that they both have term with the expansion drafts it's very difficult trade for Erfurt team to acquire guidance of yours upon contract. Almost hasn't even swap of money years things like that because. You know or merited valuable protection spots here. The teams and we protect vote. Eight to 9829. Players ten players ever it is now. So so that that's some that you have to consider as well that's why I think another reason why they would. Likely consider just waiting until he's a free agent and and and playing at that I'll add that kills what they're doing this year but I just think that. They they are so enamored with their prospects with their pipelines on Sweeney days he's taken so much credit. And the fact that he's rebuilt this from the ashes Peter Shirley just trading in and and shoddy drafting so. It's gonna be very tough for them to it to say okay finery and move on from these guys and I think that's why you're seeing this big delay in any tree that they want to make. Do you believe what Elliot Friedman has to say the dog sweetie would make you trade before he fires Julien 6177797937. Eliciting Saturday skate a Sports Radio Dunleavy Ike and layered. Hi Anderson rear admiral from arsenal sports confronted by AT&T star market and wise snacks. Freddie in New Hampshire it's a hockey just on the on the BI Freddie doesn't weigh ins we Crennel line.

I called you guys too we don't know that that's silly. And I said it was terrible in that I'll laugh he's had a 130. And I won three couldn't do anything. And numerous times the Bruins don't. Protecting. Stern did was totally different it was something different about him in that seat back and didn't play like he let people before school but didn't do that and I can understand it probably to play. He's got a custom bronze to Freddie. He's got concussion problems earlier to that that probably didn't help. Well not gotten help especially pleased to keep playing the way that when patent five million dollars but not. Mean but the Bruins I am so what I saw there is something that. You know. I think it's gonna be a change in the C I hope it's gonna be changed because what I thought it was a team that it pride. Let when it will be that wanted to go while it slightly. Sixteen minutes. Thanks Reddy. Appreciate the conference. On Larry goalies plea to the passion you mocked the that if his account you Backus Y went out there and I wrote about it OK I said that this is body paid big money in the games like that is the problem is consistency. If he's gonna show up next week and and missed five shots and continue to look like. The worst fit with David created it means nothing that he hits careful past is the play Kessel time you want to get up and I was out Ronaldo. You need more Matt yeah. That's that's a joke don't compare left Akron on a wild life that's inherent cancer right braves they'll do it out of them and they're all they'll be illegal would be wonderful those players any in the same stratosphere that's that they love this and you need you need a longer sample size of the Bacchus I mean. The fat like. This and his energy was great doesn't change fact is still has one goal and two points last ten games. He's been he's been moved around a lot they're trying to fun a spark for my I does seem like he's stuck on the crate you blind Alley if they've just. It relegated to back the feeling been like getting your teeth pulled and it's like they're chemistry is not. Really there and market it ditches its it is what it is but yet think you need more you want more you need more because it's. And Allen has been going this team's Arctic island writes coming up eight. I assurances did she set for the skills competition it's the it's later on tonight a letter read some of these a if they tweaked a few events in the order issued on the ratings this a better year got a better here yeah. And to read don't matter what they do people generally don't watch listed lateness but marsh and in Rask will be their CI don't have to grow on its final what's that guys have fun we'll touch on the also a game a bit and ended give back to us more your phone calls it a look at the league's surprises in the first half and a yeah both lanes I'm going compiling a list like Steve Buscemi over here like I hate list of all these NHL hundred but The Who gets shafted and in they put seventeen more Canadians on because there weren't enough of them already on a six billion for the NHL top 100 listed came out as well Laird admiral anti Anderson this is salary scale on Sports Radio the media. You were listening to Saturday skeet with a rear admiral and can lair. On Sports Radio WEEI. I get a feel skills competition. Getting underway in LA in a bit at Staples Center so what's marshes in the EC was pulled some needless who's going to be in the puck control. Part of the really account or something he's not the fastest skater he's doing like. Or line I don't know what you know what this weekend is what I had notes its do confuse you even if you try to read what these events argued. You have the watch it's your guys that's why I don't know Bada read them it's just one of those like crack a few Beers you know and now now it's it's actually and I have and is. You know something that a few years ago is really boring but it's one of those events that. Combined TV with Twitter and it becomes a fun thing I'd like. The people on Twitter me if you fall on the you've got to be a hockey dirt like it and I kinda do ballot bowl right with Twitter a Twitter is in Iraq in its incredible how much would it can enhance sound that collectively if everybody for all what you you know you followed talked on what a a watch some it's great like an awards the Oscars stuff like that. It's great now tonight you know there's all kinds of hockey's my make jokes and at people's expense when you sign up for Twitter you get a subscription to NHL games and Monday night raw get reps asked I think it's like the two things you like you you get with jagr and I hockey puck and wrestling tock that's how but I would say that. Looking back on it like. They are the best part about this weekend they look. Last year yet Brent Burns putting on Cuba amassed yet. The book it's like their version of the dunk contest where you can improvise. He's later only crowd they've they've done a little bit for what is this thing called for lying challenge now I think it and yet that he's such reports also accept late night when her in the sense. That on those kinds. You might die tonight. Well I challenge and as with all the players getting struck by the media and nobody cliches and drop. Exactly exactly cliches and trio going to be and down but no he's the grandson. Likes deep. You know I that's par for lunch counter the end of the puck in the deepest. Adding serie Davis is out there she's an interview every every. Every member of the team after the Portland you know she's wonderful doll artist shot. Webber vs benched in had been against set joke that's out that's according you can. Watch it tomorrow and you know from eight to ten seconds. Some of these are are at the game to put this is the the Boleyn listing of the whole thing if you win the skills competition tonight Kristi break it up into all the divisions. The winner of the skills skills competition gets to select who they placed first in the actual game the mark which. I can't even hitting a means less on the planet but anyway the games mar 330. That's going on with abortion and Tuukka Rask now Rask you said his flying straight to Tampa Tuesday's like to rejoin the team so who's playing. I got my hopes appear they can double was going to be an. All of that he was going to be in their Tuesday night to tell me pump the brakes though be Adobe is back problems my friend I'm like yeah I thought there or get in the game to warmup so he be ready to go for Tuesday. Well not think so I think the opposite McEntire has been good to get shell in Pittsburgh last at least on yeah but. He's young so it's like there's like well against all but he's young mid August 30 again shall be seen these guys have four. No Pluto and its its. Expect province. I'm MacIntyre played last night stopped 3234 win. Remains undefeated at the HL level guy is unbelievable dominated the HL doesn't matter what does not. Up. Last week last week park for all factors six chase him after two looked actor good. Our name and now. Threat but now I and so we I believe it's three Zain on Tuesday night against. The question that's pretty big game for the Bruins that's tough guy have Rask missed that game the play in the all stuff I mean I couldn't totally wrong I am but I just think that the way it's trending I don't think they send Zain down. Per game this weekend if if he's not playing on Tuesday I think because then you're taught in eleven days between games or whatever would be. If you didn't play last I've Providence so. I I think it's the ideas you wanna get him back to gain speed and and not too rusty needs him today. They are without stand Kos they are struggling this year but still in a good score some goals though. That at bat of both reasoning for for playing the Providence and reason for. Dressing grass for the seemed like he'd like you know would. I texted 3793 cent at this from. 612 Erykah going to that is. Not reared do you really believe the Doug Hamilton didn't wanna play in Boston sounds like you may be drinking became cool it BP shepherd size number that are not aka. Yeah I think I'm gonna. Hilarious. He didn't wanna be I mean people light hearted dad I'd that was a smear campaign has some sort out rightly can eat yeah yeah I did that deal. Right is used reds did says stuff that they knew before didn't use but I I don't believe I smear them but I talked and he's a lot of by the way. Erica and I talked of people that know not front office people my people the team you know all of it's sources say guess what he's outward and tights and he didn't wanna be he was reticent about it I mean any clearly put put it I mean. It was obvious by the money he took the plea for Canadian team reduced all the taxes he actually partly making less money in Calgary if you factor all that so. I mean just his actions. In bikinis like beer but yet there was a lot of a lot of stock about it to a play he was weird dude he like he just like. Quiet we like I think he's a strange obvious we edit of it if he is a little that he was calm calm like hockey yet. Or get a read on active and we was rookies like Ambien be on the ice first couple. For seasonal I don't buy you mean at the top remove the debris into I think at the time it a lot of veterans lot of guys and families. Or just they had been here for six years now whatever wasn't he Watson the twenty year old and I think he's candlelight you don't appease naturally little an introvert close ally. I did I don't think the situation helped and that's that your right immediately warm and it's able the Bruins offered more money now Longar Longar DOT wanna do it. And the rest is history it's looking good. And if Cindy Sheehan was on it forced back to Carlson we need when you point. Ollie Ollie there's hailed and he's got the all right able to start I happen have a right all right you know we're always my Geoffrey -- at all all all right I am sure about it it up quick little story about that right. Now that he's on its way up he's never tweeted once right never like he follows. It's not those shirts are pretty pitchers for equalizer in to a lot a lot to get you know I'll get one when it. You know like solve common practice our Kamal you know what I mean all media now. Hockey judge each to nicest guys if if it if our guys that you up for free free teacher. They're generally guy either a at least read in a shaky hand. On maybe give you some return went out and idle I'm 45 years old I don't need something I don't need to shake a 20 kids and I'm just figure like off Osce can be thankful would have. All I was agonize I still not available whenever he avoided like wouldn't he would meet me he's like I just go to my it's my pace usually politically as a wife and he was he was I thought it was like he was like I don't think Brady needs you Lake County. Was I got as it was you know it was all bought the only I'd be afraid to meet me but it was you know I didn't hear it was like I was I was gonna ask him for autographs I'm just. Again comparing to up. Hockey plays and deal of them for years and the way the especially you know rounded down to earth it was selling those ugly hit you up for free be united Europe can't catch all hooked up because I ideally. And that isn't aware of the Indian thing you know put on a locker Q revenue or putting himself on I left the army did get a but it was as I said it was only this strains I thought. A hockey player at that. Not only beat it just say hello is this is generally great guys let's settles the betrayed and yeah I don't let you wrap on the space out. Now so all this happened in and on the stories on Mike yeah on that makes sense it's like a little bit like. And what doesn't mean you know like when that we don't like he played at home. So I obviously are gone for two seconds and just say thanks that I'm on Obama a free teacher a few and yeah and you want it you gotta leave at the bakery it's like month by year Greek. I talk. Bonus half hours Saturday's game coming up rusty my eighteenth these are market wise next that's rear admiral one and only from Parcells sports scientists here on gentler more coming up center up by cigarette.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NHL - Philadelphia Flyers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NHL - Boston Bruins news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Saturday Skate - Bruins and All-Star weekend","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WEEI 93.7 FM","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"477455616","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"WEEI 93.7 FM","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.weei.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196782966","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n \nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen. Tashfeen Malik was from a family of wealthy landowners in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia with her immediate family. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a US citizen. \n \nPakistan and Saudi Arabia, however, are not on the list of countries subject to the new ban. \n \nThe administration is facing criticism from leaders in the U.S. and around the world for taking steps their critics say are unconstitutional and anti-American. \n \nThe second mention of San Bernardino came when the official was trying to explain why there was no grace period before the executive order went into effect, to help ease implementation. \n \n\"Imagine if this had been an executive order that had been contemplated the day before the San Bernardino shooter entered the United States?\" the official asked. \"Would have delaying its implementation served the best interests of the country? The reality is we don't know who the next individual is who will exploit our immigration programs successfully.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2750","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Penrith","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Penrith Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169743242","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Penrith Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.penrithstar.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196807507","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

I thought that the president was both rude and rather indifferent to his British guest. When asked her opinion about the US spat with Mexico, Trump said \"the British prime minister has bigger thinks to worry about.\". This may be the case but it is for Theresa May to say and not him. When a British reporter picked by May asked a perfectly legitimate question which may not have been to Trump's liking, he replied: \"Well, there goes that relationship.\" \n\nTrump backed Britain on Brexit but he has his own agenda: he is no fan of the European Union. There was no word on the trade deal which Britain so desperately needs and perhaps too much emphasis on Winston Churchill. I thought, though, that May was excellent. She is not a great orator but she certainly got the exposure she needed. So what of the special relationship? I was hoping that May was going to burst into that now famous speech by Hugh Grant in Love Actually : \"We may be a small country but we\u2019re a great one, too. The country of Shakespeare, Churchill, the Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter, David Beckham\u2019s right foot, David Beckham\u2019s left foot, come to that. And a friend who bullies us is no longer a friend. And since bullies only respond to strength, from now onward I will be prepared to be much stronger. And the president should be prepared for that.\" \n\nBut no, May was polite and said little. There is no doubt that Trump is a bully and I can see May being strong when required. But I doubt that this relationship is going to be special. A marriage of convenience after a divorce from a long relationship with Europe, I think is the case.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jason Moore"},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"No Trump card for May","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe","countryCode":"ES","country":"Spain"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Majorca Daily Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"410268984","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Majorca Daily Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://majorcadailybulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://banners.evoluhcion.es/www/delivery/ck.php?n=ac87e5c3&cb=851545060"],"sequenceId":"695196814191","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:45:09Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Will they be celebrating against Cadiz?  23-10-2016 Miquel Borras  \nReal Mallorca play third place Cadiz at the Son Moix tonight. The Andalusian side came up through the play-offs last summer and, after an indifferent start, have only lost one of their last six games and look a serious contender for promotion. \n\nThere's a strong Mallorca connection with the visitors. Their coach, Alvaro Cervera, played as a winger at the old Luis Sitjar ground between 1987/1992, making 140 appearances. Thirty-six-year-old Dani Güiza is a Real Mallorca footballing legend and returned to his native Cadiz in 2015. Dani played for us in season 2007/8 and was our and Spain's leading scorer that season with 27, all scored from open play. \n\nAnother striker who came here on loan last year is Alfredo Ortuño. The Murcia-born hit-man scored four goals in 19 appearances and is this season's second top La Segunda scorer with 13. \n\nIt's been another hard working week for Mallorca coach Javier Olaizola on the training ground and his line-up tonight, with the exception of the suspended Yuste, is probably the strongest starting XI of the season, especially up front. It's expected that Dejan Lekic will lead the line with Lago playing just behind him and Mountinho and Brandon down the flanks. Oriol was having a late fitness test yesterday. Lekic has scored in his last three games and has hit the woodwork twice in his last two as has Moutinho. A lot is expected of Lekic at the moment as the club have given up on making any more transfer window signings, basically because they can't find anybody suitable who wants to come here, with the team struggling to get back up the league. \n\nSomebody asked me the other day what would happen to the club if, God forbid, we were relegated. It would probably mean the death knell for the club in its present form as they would slip into the regionalised and theoretically amateur second division B (or Third division) with its 80 teams spread across four sub divisions. \n\nHaving said that the following doesn't make for good reading. A recently-published audit reveals the delicate financial state of Real Mallorca. The club closed the last financial year with an eight million euro deficit after a season in which sporting costs rose by one million euros. The report reflects a total debt of 36 million euros and last year the club was on the brink of bankruptcy. There are two reasons for this loss: 1) the club no longer received any benefits for relegation; and 2) didn't find a sponsor to cover the losses. The shareholders have changed, but the club continues to be a big black hole into which huge amounts of money disappear. \n\nThe net worth (13.59 million) was close to being less than half of the social capital (26.66 million). If it had fallen below that figure the club would have entered an irreversible descent into dissolution. This critical situation forced the shareholders to take the painful decision to reduce the capital. That was approved by the board in December so doesn't appear on this latest audit and served to cover the deficit of eight million euros. \n\nThe 64-page economic report is bad news for Real Mallorca and of course it isn't helped by them being stuck in the bottom half of La Segunda. The total debt rose to 36 million (32.15\u20ac long term and 3.9\u20ac short term). At today's date this amount is lower as the reduction in capital doesn't count and gives a breather to the treasury but is still high for a club which has a strict calendar of debts to be paid. Relegation and the massive fall in TV revenue haven't helped our cause. Mallorca continue to have the costs of a first division team with the income of a second division one. Only counting basic costs (electricity etc.), it has spent the astronomical sum of 500,000 euros a month. One of the main differences between the last two years is the profit from selling players. The 229,080 euros from the year 2015/16 pales in comparison with the 3.55 million made from the sale of Marco Asensio to Real Madrid. \n\nNew owner Robert Sarver has his work cut out. His takeover has already cost him a significant sum of cash, and it's going to cost him a lot more before he can sit back and enjoy the ride. The best way to improve Real Mallorca's serious financial distress is to get promotion to La Liga. But we're not alone, however. The debts paint an alarming picture of just how difficult it is for many clubs to survive. \n  \n\n   Related Tags","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Monro Bryce"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"All about the strikers against Cadiz","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe","countryCode":"ES","country":"Spain"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Majorca Daily Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"410268984","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Majorca Daily Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://majorcadailybulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://banners.evoluhcion.es/www/delivery/ck.php?n=ac87e5c3&cb=219844630"],"sequenceId":"695196814482","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T15:57:53Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But they admitted that they found no evidence supporting the lurid allegations against Trump. Media outlets that investigated the claims also said they found no evidence that the alleged \u201cgolden shower\u201d video exists. \n \nBuzzFeed came under heavy criticism from its peers for publishing the dossier after admitting that the claims were unsubstantiated. \n \nIn a recent blog post, Christo Grocev, a Bulgarian expert in Russians security issues, claimed it was likely that Erovinkin was the source close to Sechin that Steele referred to in his report. \n \n\u201cInsiders have described Erovinkin to me alternately as \u2018Sechin\u2019s treasurer\u2019 and \u2018the go-between between Putin and Sechin,'\u201d Grocev wrote. \u201cOne thing that everyone seems to agree \u2014 both in public and private sources \u2014 is that Erovinkin was Sechin\u2019s closest associate.\u201d \n \n\u201cI have no doubt that at the time Erovinkin died, Putin had Steele\u2019s Trump dossier on his desk,\u201d Grocev continued. \u201cHe would \u2013 arguably \u2013 have known whether the alleged\u2026 story is based on fact or fiction.\u201d \n \n\u201c[Putin] had a motive to seek and find the mole. He would have had to conclude that Erovinkin was at least a person of interest.\u201d \n \nBut, according to the Telegraph , some experts in Russian security issues have expressed skepticism about the theory that Erovinkin was murdered by the Russian state to cover up the truth about the Trump dossier. According to some experts, it is unlikely that Putin would have ordered the assassination of a senior official in the circumstances and manner that rumors suggested. \n \n[Featured Image by Alexander Nemenov/AP Images] is an article from: The Inquisitr News","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JohnThomas Didymus"},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Former KGB Chief Who Allegedly Helped To Compile \u2018Golden Shower\u2019 Dossier On Donald Trump Found Dead","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Inquisitr","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169676540","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"213"},"name":"Inquisitr","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.inquisitr.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/27/mystery-death-ex-kgb-chief-linked-mi6-spys-dossier-donald-trump/","https://t.co/MdWIow3kIB","https://twitter.com/hashtag/OlegErovinkin?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/kompromat?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/FSB?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/Russia?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/MI6?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/TBD?src=hash","https://twitter.com/Anna_ohlala/status/825555482685235200","https://t.co/IpR0jc4V55","https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheResistance?src=hash","https://twitter.com/noclosedminds/status/825428651072245760","https://twitter.com/hashtag/KGB?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/chief?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/helped?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/spy?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/compile?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/dossier?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/dead?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lexus?src=hash","https://t.co/NGsN54fBdR","https://t.co/ytJiiF4GUt","https://twitter.com/zeusFanHouse/status/825418412130201601","https://t.co/gMODfeIBcP","https://twitter.com/thus_spake/status/825565522427252737","https://cgrozev.wordpress.com/author/christogrozev/","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Inquisitr?a=AK26OruapK4:po4ZdFCT0t4:yIl2AUoC8zA","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Inquisitr?a=AK26OruapK4:po4ZdFCT0t4:D7DqB2pKExk","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Inquisitr?a=AK26OruapK4:po4ZdFCT0t4:gIN9vFwOqvQ","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Inquisitr?a=AK26OruapK4:po4ZdFCT0t4:V_sGLiPBpWU","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Inquisitr?a=AK26OruapK4:po4ZdFCT0t4:7Q72WNTAKBA","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Inquisitr?a=AK26OruapK4:po4ZdFCT0t4:qj6IDK7rITs"],"sequenceId":"695196817606","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:11Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/President-Vladimir-Putin.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Many organizations and groups have protested President Trump\u2019s decision to sign the executive order on Friday, temporarily barring immigrants (from seven Muslim countries) and refugees from entering the country. President Trump said that this particular order was designed to prohibit radical terrorists from entering the United States. But the decision also consequently puts a temporary blanket ban for any refugee trying to enter the United States of America. \n \n\u201cI am heartbroken that today President Trump is closing the door on children, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war. I am heartbroken that America is turning its back on a proud history of welcoming refugees and immigrants \u2014 the people who helped build your country, ready to work hard in exchange for a fair chance at a new life.\u201d \n  \nMalala wrote that she was heartbroken for all Syrian refugees, specially the children, who had had to suffer through 6-years of war. She called the President\u2019s decision an act of discrimination. Malala also added the story of her friend, Zaynab, a refugee who fled 3 wars to come to the U.S. as a refugee at age 17. Zaynab learned English, graduated high school and is currently in college, studying to be a human rights lawyer. \n \nMalala ended her statement with a personal note to President Trump. \n \n\u201cIn this time of uncertainty and unrest around the world, I ask President Trump not to turn his back on the world\u2019s most defenseless children and families.\u201d \n Trump says that his latest order will prohibit radical terrorists from entering the country.

Malala who lives in Birmingham in the U.K. rose to prominence following her advocacy for human\u2019s rights and woman\u2019s education in her native Swat Valley in Pakistan, where the Taliban had banned girls from going to school. She was featured in Time magazine\u2019s 2013, 2014 and 2015 issues as one of \u201cThe 100 Most Influential People in the World\u201d. She was the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize. \n \nMany have criticized Trump\u2019s decision for being biased against Muslims. A vocal critic of the President\u2019s decision to bar Muslim immigrants has been former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Albright, who came to the U.S. with her family as a refugee from Czechoslovakia in 1948, fleeing persecution by the Communist government, points out that \u201cby specifically targeting Muslim-majority countries for these immigration bans, and by expressing a clear preference for refugees who are religious minorities,\u201d there was no question that Trump\u2019s order was biased against Muslims. \n \n\u201cAnd when one faith is targeted, it puts us all at risk.\u201d \n President Donald Trump signed the controversial order on Friday, January 27. [Image via Pool/]  \nTrump signed the decision to indefinitely bar all Syrian Refugees from entering the U.S. He also put a 120 day bar on refugees from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. No visa will be issued to citizens of these Muslim-majority countries for the next 30 days. Trump called this decision \u201ca measure to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of America,\u201d explicitly specifying, \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d Trump paid homage to the victims of the September 11 attacks, dedicating this decision to them. \n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to admit the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those that support our country and love, deeply, our people.\u201d \n  \nI promise that our administration will ALWAYS have your back.

Syrian refugees have exceptionally been barred from the US \u201cindefinitely.\u201d \n \nIn a less-than-tacit rebuttal of Trump\u2019s policy, Trudeau wrote on his Twitter page on Saturday, \u201cTo those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada.\u201d \n \nOrder... and then chaos \n \nThe Canadian premier also posted a picture of himself greeting a Syrian child at Toronto\u2019s airport in late 2015. \n \nTrump\u2019s ban, which American media say has not been thought through and been drawn up without an understanding of the legal and other difficulties it will raise, has bewildered US officials. Homeland Security and State Department career officials, who say they have not been briefed about the specifications of the order, have had to enforce haphazard practices at airports in the absence of clear instructions. \n \nTravelers from the listed countries have been stopped from boarding US-bound planes since the order was issued on Friday. People who were already mid-flight were detained on arrival in the US even if they held valid visas or other approved applications. \n \nCanada has received more than 39,000 refugees from Syria alone and has promised to allow 300,000 more refugees, mostly coming in for economic reasons, from other countries in 2017. \n US President Donald Trump takes the cap off a pen to sign an executive order to start building a wall on the Mexico border to stop refugees, in Washington, DC, January 25, 2017.

But in so doing, the US president was unwittingly demonstrating his incognizance of the facts even as he attempted to sound informed of history.

- \n\nRussian officials have faced a difficult balancing act as they battled the longest recession during President Vladimir Putin's time in power. \n\nWhen the ruble plummeted at the start of the crisis in 2014, the authorities quickly gave up costly interventions to prop up the currency. \n\nThis meant widespread pain for average Russians as the ruble's plunge spurred inflation and sent borrowing rates soaring. \n\nBut experts said the currency's slide helped absorb some of the shock, by propping up budget revenues from oil and helping to spur competitiveness of Russian goods. \n\nThat has been a traditional weak point for Russia, and the lower ruble dovetailed with government calls for companies to step up production inside the country, instead of relying on imports. \n\nIn a sign that Wednesday's announcement was aimed at enticing foreign investors, the move was first signalled by deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov in an interview at the Davos forum in Switzerland this month. \n\nOleg Kuzmin from Renaissance Capital, who estimates that the operations will amount to about $80 million a day, called the decision from the authorities \"rational\". \n\n\"This could smooth the impact of the oil price on the Russian economy, secure the competitive advantages that Russia received after the last devaluation and make the budget and current account surplus more secure,\" he wrote in a note. \n\nThe finance ministry said Putin himself had decided that the surplus oil revenue would not be used for \"additional spending\" but would go towards buying foreign currencies to bolster the country's depleted reserve funds. \n\nThat means the Kremlin (IOB: 0Q8D.IL - news ) seems intent, at least for now, on shoring up the state coffers rather than loosening austerity ahead of presidential elections next year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Global news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Ruble's revival gives Russia an unexpected headache","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Yahoo!

A middle-of-the-night lawsuit filed on behalf of two Iraqi men challenged Trump's executive action, which was signed on Friday and initially cast as applying to refugees and migrants.\n\nAmid mounting chaos a US federal judge issued an emergency stay that temporarily blocked the government from sending people out of the country after they have landed at a US airport with valid visas.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union estimated the stay would affect 100 to 200 people detained at US airports or in transit, but government lawyers could not confirm that number.\n\nJudge Ann Donnelly of the US District Court in New York made the order on Saturday.\n\nAs the day progressed, administration officials had confirmed that the sweeping order also targeted US legal residents from the named countries - green-card holders - who happened to be abroad when it was signed. Also subject to being barred entry into the US are dual nationals, or people born in one of the seven countries who hold passports even from US allies such as Britain.\n\nAmong those blindsided were 50 people detained at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.\n\nDozens of people showed up there in support of Muslim families, some carrying signs protesting Friday's order.\n\n\"Refugees are welcome here!\" one read, and another said: \"We turned Jews back, now Muslims?\"\n\nThe growing crowd in Terminal D erupted into jubilant chants of \"USA! USA! USA!\" when Arya Neal Behgooy of Plano and his wife, Shima, emerged from the door that spits out international travellers.\n\nArya Behgooy is a US citizen. Shima Behgooy is a green-card holder from Iran.\n\nAhmad Behgooy embraced Arya, his son. Shima dissolved into the arms of her mother-in-law, Afsaneh Behgooy, who was holding a bouquet of roses that had begun to wilt during the hours-long wait.\n\nShima and her husband had flown from Tehran to Frankfurt, Germany. Mid-flight on their way to Dallas, the couple learned about the ban on travellers from Iran, including green-card holders.\n\nImmigration officers ultimately gave Shima an exemption, her husband said, though he noted that 30 to 40 other travellers were still being held.\n\nDallas mayor Mike Rawlings made his feelings about Trump's order known at a downtown news conference on Saturday night.\n\n\"It's just not good for our city. It's not good for the state,\" Rawlings said. \"This is not a solution. This is a foul insult to the rest of the country.\"\n\nMiriam Yasin was eventually reunited with her 54-year-old mother, Najah al-Shamieh.\n\n\"It feels so good, but it's sad for the other ones,\" Yasin said, the crowd cheering at their tearful reunion. \"I feel like I want to stay here for the other ones.\"\n\nAlia Salem, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), said about 50 people had been detained at Dallas-Fort Worth on Saturday morning.\n\nBy midafternoon that number was down to nine, some joined by local family members in a detention area at the airport.\n\nThe virtually unprecedented measures triggered harsh reactions not only from Democrats and others who typically advocate for immigrants but also key sectors of the US business community. Leading technology companies recalled scores of overseas employees and sharply criticised the President. Legal experts forecast a wave of litigation over the order, calling it unconstitutional. Canada announced it would accept asylum applications from US green-card holders.\n\nYet Trump, who centred his campaign in part on his vow to crack down on illegal immigrants and , was unbowed. As White House officials insisted that the measure strengthens national security, the President stood squarely behind it.\n\n\"It's not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over. It's working out very nicely, and we're going to have a very, very strict ban, and we're going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\"\n\nGovernor Cuomo, protecting the right to protest. #MuslimBan pic.twitter.com/KWnBAHCFRc\n\nThough several congressional Republicans denounced the order, the vast majority remained silent and a few voiced crucial support - including, most prominently, House Speaker Paul Ryan, who had rejected Trump's anti-Muslim proposals during the campaign.\n\n\"This is not a religious test, and it is not a ban on people of any religion,'' Ryan said on Saturday. \"This order does not affect the vast majority of Muslims in the world.\"\n\nThe President's order suspends admission to the US of all refugees for 120 days and bars for 90 days the entry of any citizen from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia. That list excludes several majority-Muslim nations - notably Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia - where the Trump Organisation, now run by the President's sons, is active and which in some cases have also faced troublesome issues with terrorism.\n\nAccording to the text of the order, the restriction applies to countries that have already been excluded from programs allowing people to travel to the US without a visa because of terrorism concerns. Hewing closely to nations already named as terrorism concerns elsewhere in law might have allowed the White House to avoid angering majority-Muslim allies such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n\nJanuary 28, 2017. #muslimban #nobannowall JFK O'Hare BOS DFW SFO SEA Dulles DEN LAX pic.twitter.com/zzduGp9AqP\n\nAmid widespread confusion on Saturday about how the order will be enforced, some administration officials acknowledged that its rollout had been chaotic. Officials tried to reassure travellers and their families, pointing out that green-card holders in the United States will not be affected and noting that the Department of Homeland Security is allowed to grant waivers to those individuals and others deemed to not pose a security threat. It can take years for someone to become a green-card holder, or lawful permanent resident authorised to permanently live and work in the country.\n\n\"If you've been living in the United States for 15 years and you own a business and your family is here, will you be granted a waiver? I'm assuming yes, but we are working that out,'' said one official, who could not be more specific because details remained so cloudy.\n\nLove is what makes America great! This is happening at Dulles right now. #MuslimBan #Dulles #NoBanNoWall pic.twitter.com/WP3XrzeCeo\n\nA senior White House official later said that waivers will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and that green-card holders in the United States will have to meet with a consular officer before leaving the country.\n\nBut officials made clear that the federal officers detaining refugees and migrants with valid US visas and restricting them from entering the country were following orders handed down by top Homeland Security officials, at the White House's behest.\n\nMore than 4000 academics from universities nationwide signed a statement of opposition and voiced concern the ban would become permanent. They described it as discriminatory and \"inhumane, ineffective and un-American\".\n\nThe executive action has caused \"complete chaos\" and torn apart families, said Abed Ayoub, legal and policy director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.\n\nAt Dulles International Airport, Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe addressed more than 100 people protesting Trump's order.\n\n\"We want to know who is being detained and why they are being detained,\" McAuliffe said. \"I remind everybody we are a land of immigrants. . . . Discriminatory tactics breed hatred.''\n\nHis remarks were cheered by demonstrators holding signs saying \"Refugees welcome here\" and \"Stand with Muslims\".\n\nProtesters lock hands and circle around people praying at Denver International Airport. #MuslimBan #resist #Colorado pic.twitter.com/6wLxHRzvmu\n\nIn New York City, lawyers for two Iraqi men detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport - one of whom, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, served the US military mission in Iraq - filed a federal lawsuit challenging the order as unconstitutional. They also are seeking class certification so they may represent all refugees and visa-holders who are being held at US ports of entry.\n\n\"We have a moral obligation to protect and repay these people who risked their lives for US troops,\" said Brandon Friedman, who, as an infantry lieutenant with the 101st Airborne Division, worked with Darweesh in Iraq. \n\n\"There are not many Americans who have done as much for this country as he has. He's put himself on the line,\" Friedman added. \"He's put his family on the line to help US soldiers in combat, and it is astonishing to me that this country would suddenly not allow people like that in.\"\n\nOutside the terminal, Darweesh was greeted by his advocates after nearly 19 hours in detention, as well as protesters opposed to the Trump policy who had come to the airport to support him and the others who had been detained.\n\nAlthough shaken, Darweesh paused to speak to the media before moving on to reunite with his family. A reporter asked if he was angry. \"No, because I have these people,\" he said, gripping his lawyer's shoulder. \"This is America.\"\n\nWhile immigration advocates said at least one refugee family had been detained at San Francisco International Airport, there was no immediate count of how many refugees were being held at airports nationwide. Advocates said that ticketed passengers also had been barred from boarding US-bound flights overseas, and they confirmed that green-card holders who left the United States have been unable to return.\n\nIn Cairo, airport officials said seven US-bound migrants - six from Iraq and one from Yemen - were prevented Saturday from boarding an EgyptAir flight to JFK Airport, according to the Associated Press.\n\nOther advocates promised further legal challenges. CAIR said it would file a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional.\n\n\"There is no evidence that refugees - the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation - are a threat to national security,\" said Lena Masri, CAIR's national litigation director. \"This is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\"\n\nIn a conference call with reporters, immigration lawyers and advocates said Trump's order violated the Constitution, along with US and international laws that guarantee migrants the right to apply for asylum at the border and the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which forbids discrimination in the issuance of visas based on race, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.\n\nBut Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Centre for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels, praised Trump for taking action to pause the refugee resettlement program and limit immigration from the seven countries.\n\n\"It's a prudent measure,\" he said. \"It's not the end of the world. It's not the Statue of Liberty crying. The reaction has been hyperbolic.\"\n\nThe effects of Trump's order played out nationwide.\n\nIn Dallas, Behzad Honarjou, 43, was supposed to pick up his mother, 70-year-old Shahin Haffanpour, at the airport on Saturday. But when she arrived from Iran via Dubai, she was told that because of the executive order she would be sent back to Iran the next morning.\n\n\"I don't know what to do,\" Honarjou said. He said he was seeking an attorney to file an emergency habeas petition, but the courts were closed. Haffanpour has an immigrant's visa issued by the US embassy in Ankara, Turkey, last year.\n\nIn Philadelphia, Sarah Assali said six relatives from Syria - two uncles, their wives and two cousins - were detained after arriving at the airport there early Saturday. Although they are Christian immigrants with valid visas to join family in this country, they were put on a plane back to Doha, Qatar, three hours later, Assali said.\n\nShe said her family members were not allowed to call or contact their family in the United States before being removed. \"We don't know what's going to happen next.\"\n\nWashington Post, New York Times, Dallas Morning News","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jerry Markon, Emma Brown and David Nakamura"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Turkey news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Judge orders stay on Trump's Muslim ban as protesters flood airports","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Melbourne Age","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169652301","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3545"},"name":"Melbourne Age","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theage.com.au/","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/hashtag/MuslimBan?src=hash","https://t.co/KWnBAHCFRc","https://twitter.com/hashtag/muslimban?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/nobannowall?src=hash","https://t.co/zzduGp9AqP","https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dulles?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoBanNoWall?src=hash","https://t.co/WP3XrzeCeo","https://twitter.com/hashtag/resist?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/Colorado?src=hash","https://t.co/6wLxHRzvmu","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/opinion/trumps-immigration-ban-is-illegal.html"],"sequenceId":"695196832447","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Trump and his team insisted the order was not intended to target Islam and its followers, but the hashtag #muslimban trended, and many Muslims both in America and abroad said they viewed the measure as a broadly conceived and stinging exclusion.\n\nCapping a day of high-stakes drama, a federal judge in New York, Ann M. Donnelly, ordered a halt to deportations of travelers who arrived at airports with valid visas to enter the U.S., saying that sending them back to the affected countries could cause them \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d But she did not rule on the legality of the executive order, nor did she say that others who have not yet arrived in the U.S. can be allowed to proceed.\n\nOpponents of the president\u2019s directive vowed to seek a wider court win. Lawyers from groups including the American Civil Liberties Union said they intended to press ahead with efforts to overturn the president\u2019s overall order on constitutional grounds. And they rejoiced at their early victory.\n\n\u201cClearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country,\u201d said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero. \u201cOn week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d\n\nIn a separate and more limited ruling, a federal judge in Virginia ordered a weeklong stay against removing people with permanent U.S. residency who had been detained under the presidential order at Washington Dulles International Airport.\n\nAs the directive\u2019s effects spread, thousands staged spontaneous protests against refugee detention at airports across the country, including in Los Angeles and San Francisco. At New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, demonstrators waved signs and read from the famous Emma Lazarus poem inscribed in the Statue of Liberty.\n\nAt more than a dozen airports, including Los Angeles, Newark, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and Atlanta, immigration attorneys stepped up in droves to offer free services to those detained. \u201cA lot of tears and emotion here,\u201d said Hassan Ahmad, a lawyer from northern Virginia who hustled to Dulles airport.\n\nThe New York order appeared to affect the 100 to 200 people who were detained in transit to the United States. While the order will prevent them from being sent home, it was less clear whether they will have to remain in detention while their asylum cases are being decided.\n\nOne of the two detained Iraqis named in the case, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was an interpreter who had worked on behalf of the U.S. government. Freed after 19 hours in custody, he wept as he spoke to reporters, thanking supporters and calling America \u201cthe land of freedom, the land of rights.\u201d\n\nThe groups bringing the legal challenge, who also included the International Refugee Assistance Project and the National Immigration Law Center, said a separate motion sets the stage for a larger action involving other would-be refugees, visitors and immigrants stopped at other ports of entry.\n\nArab American advocacy groups also were reacting to the new order, warning that it was disrupting travel all over the world.\n\n\u201cWe see complete chaos in the way this has been implemented,\u201d Abed A. Ayoub, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said in a conference call with reporters.\n\nThe directive, he said, had caught up not only desperate refugees who had thought themselves within a hairsbreadth of safety, but many more with already established lives, homes and families in the United States. \u201cThis order needs to be rescinded,\u201d he said.\n\nIn another legal challenge, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would file a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. The suit, to be filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Virginia, argues that the executive order is unconstitutional because of its apparent aim of singling out Muslims.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that refugees \u2014 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2014 are a threat to national security,\u201d the group\u2019s national litigation director, Lena F. Masri, said in a statement. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d\n\nThe order, signed Friday by Trump during a visit to the Pentagon, suspends all refugee entries for 120 days. In addition, it indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees and bars entry to the U.S. for 90 days for those traveling from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nProminent Muslim figures raised their voices in opposition to the temporary refugee ban, saying children would be among those suffering the most from it.\n\nNobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by the Taliban, said in a statement that she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d that Trump was closing the door on \u201cchildren, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said the travel ban also covered holders of green cards, who are authorized to live and work in the U.S. Some reports have put the number of such permanent residents from the affected countries as high as half a million.\n\nAn administration official said that current green card holders from the affected countries would be allowed to remain in the U.S. \u2014 but that those caught outside the country at the time of the ban\u2019s imposition would have to be allowed back in on a case-by-case basis. Those with business overseas will have to meet beforehand with a consular official.\n\nThe measure\u2019s scope was also widened by a State Department announcement that dual nationals from the seven affected countries who also held passports from third countries such as Britain or Canada could be blocked \u2014 in effect denying U.S. entry to citizens of closely allied nations.\n\nAs the measure\u2019s far-reaching impact became clear, and the airport chaos mounted throughout the day, Trump denied it was a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and said the process was going smoothly. \u201cWe were totally prepared,\u201d he told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely, and we\u2019re going to have a very, very strict ban.\u201d\n\nThe move has hit the technology industry, which employs thousands of foreign-born workers, many from Muslim-majority countries. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai on Friday slammed Trump\u2019s executive order in a memo to employees, saying about 100 employees were affected, and advising those traveling abroad to reach out to the company\u2019s immigration teams for assistance.\n\nInvestors and start-up employees are worried as well. Tech workers from countries such as Egypt and Jordan fear the list could soon expand to include their countries.\n\nThe entertainment world felt repercussions, too. It\u2019s uncertain whether Iranian filmmaker and Oscar nominee Asghar Farhadi will be able to attend next month\u2019s Academy Awards ceremony, though there are artistic waivers to the ban.\n\nRelatives wondered when they would see loved ones again. Iranian American Milad Sharifpour, a physician at Emory University in Atlanta, was worried for his brother, Ali Reza, a green card holder who was in Tehran visiting family when the directive took effect. \u201cI am sad, I\u2019m upset, and I feel very frustrated,\u201d Sharifpour said.\n\nMany feared that what they intended as temporary trips abroad could become prolonged ordeals. A Syrian clarinetist who lives in New York and holds permanent U.S. residency was in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, for a concert when the order took effect.\n\nIt left him unsure whether he would be able to go back to his Brooklyn apartment, he said, \u201clet alone all the concerts and residencies I have in the U.S. in the coming few months.\u201d\n\nHe asked not to be identified, because he will soon be trying to return to the U.S.\n\n\u201cI am not sure how to describe how I feel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is certainly not about me; it is about so many individuals whose lives were deeply affected.\u201d The United Nations human rights agency issued a statement calling the long-standing U.S. refugee resettlement program \u201cone of the most important in the world.\u201d It called on the Trump administration to ensure the U.S. \u201cwill continue its strong leadership role and long tradition of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race,\u201d the group said.\n\nAcross the United States, refugee advocates scrambled to ascertain the status of those who were already en route or about to leave when the order came down. A total of 30 refugees were scheduled to arrive in Atlanta next week from Somalia, Afghanistan, Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nAll had gone through months of security checks.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d said J.D. McCrary, executive director of the International Rescue Committee\u2019s Atlanta office. \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with anything like this ever happening on such a mass scale in the entire history of this program. Slamming the door on those fleeing persecution is deeply un-American.\u201d\n\nIn Congress, reaction to the immigration chaos tended to break down along party lines, with vociferous criticism from Democrats while Republicans largely remained silent.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Trump had chosen a \u201cdark path,\u201d while both Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco said the Statue of Liberty would have wept.\n\nOne of the few Republicans to speak out against the directive was Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who said the order could play into the hands of jihadist groups by being excessively sweeping in nature.\n\n\u201cWhile not technically a Muslim ban, this order is too broad,\u201d Sasse said in a statement.\n\nAirports overseas and in the U.S. found themselves at ground zero for the spreading chaos. Five members of one Iraqi family, along with a Yemeni, were prevented from boarding flights in Cairo.\n\nAt the Frankfurt airport in Germany, a major hub for travel from the Middle East and onward to Europe and the U.S., more were stranded. A German radio network quoted federal police as saying that 20 people from all seven countries on the list were stuck in the airport\u2019s transit zone, unable to board flights for the U.S.\n\nIn Atlanta, a growing cluster of family members and lawyers gathered Saturday at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after at least five permanent U.S. residents who had traveled to Iran on vacation were detained by federal immigration officials.\n\nMansour Kenareh, 55, an Iranian software engineer who lives in Suwanee, Ga., said his brother-in law, his wife and their 10-year-old child had been detained after returning from a vacation in Tehran to visit family.\n\n\"They have green cards, they have bank accounts, they have a house here,\" Kenareh said as he paced the arrivals hall of the international terminal after an unfruitful visit to a Customs and Border Protection office. Officials, he said, had detained the family for more than five hours, even though they had lived legally in the U.S. for more than a year. \n\nSarah Owings, an immigration attorney, said that she had not been allowed to meet with the detained immigrants at the Atlanta airport. \n\n\u201cThese are people who live here; they have houses, they have dogs, cars,\u201d Owings said. \"This should not be happening. They can't send back a permanent resident without a hearing.\"\n\nLate Saturday, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said that all 11 people who were detained at the airport had been cleared and released.\n\nIn Europe, there was blowback from U.S. allies, who have absorbed a wave of refugees over the last two years and are already deeply unhappy with Trump for disparaging the NATO alliance and predicting the breakup of the European Union.\n\n\u201cWhen he rejects the arrival of refugees while Europe has done its duty, we should respond to him,\u201d said French President Francois Hollande.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, well aware of Trump\u2019s evangelical Christian base of support, said pointedly, \u201c\u2018Love thy neighbor\u2019 is part of this tradition, the act of helping others.\u201d\n\nOn social media, users bemoaned what they said was a blow to what remained of the world\u2019s respect for American ideals.\n\n\u201cFascism USA 2017,\u201d tweeted Mona Eltahawy, an Egyptian American author and activist.\n\nThe prospect of reciprocal measures was raised almost immediately \u2014 a factor that could potentially affect Americans including aid workers, tourists and business travelers. Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry, condemning Trump\u2019s order, said Saturday that Iran \u201creserves the right of reciprocity,\u201d official outlets reported.\n\nTrump\u2019s move could also dampen hopes for negotiating the release of U.S. citizens held in any of the affected countries. Several Americans of Iranian descent are imprisoned in Iran on spy charges.\n\nHave the women\u2019s marches started a movement?

A vice president, working with a \"majority of either the principle officers of the executive departments, or of such body as Congress may by law provide,\" can remove the president for being \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\" \n \nEven the craven enabling Republicans would do well to read that provision, because the day may come when they're finally compelled to acknowledge -- in the national interest -- that Trump is dangerously off his rocker. We're only days into this farce, and it's obvious already. As conservative commentator Andrew Ferguson rightly points out, \"the candidate who campaigned as a sociopath shows signs he may yet govern as one.\" \n \nThe latest reminder is Trump's alternative fact about the election. At the tail end of November, he said he was robbed of a popular vote victory because millions of people had \"voted illegally\" for Hillary. It was just another baldfaced lie. He had zero evidence of massive voter fraud, just as he'd had zero evidence that Obama was foreign-born. We figured -- foolish us -- that Trump, with his attention deficit disorder, would simply forget the lie and find a new one. Which he did. \n \nBut now he's obsessing about it again, marinating anew in his delusion. We should not be surprised. Sick and twisted people do stuff like this. \n \nOn Monday night, during a bipartisan meeting with congressional leaders, he stated that he lost the popular vote because three to five million people voted illegally. He offered no evidence of mass fraud, because there isn't any. Then during a press briefing, propaganda minister Sean Spicer recited Trump's alternative fact, and said it was \"based on studies and evidence that people have presented to him.\" The press asked: What studies? What evidence? Spicer replied: \"Studies and information he has.\" \n \nWhat studies? What information? Trump is apparently still fixated on a November story that was posted on Infowars, a tinfoil-hat website, which declared in a headline: \"3 million votes in presidential election cast by illegal aliens.\" Problem is, the story had no evidence. Plus, the guy who runs Infowars has stated on the record that the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre never happened. \n \nBut Trump still won't let it go, taking to Twitter to announce, \"I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD.\" \n \nSomeone in the Justice Department should tell him that illegal voting on a massive scale is impossible to pull off without everyone noticing it on day one. Someone in Justice should remind him that when Jill Stein sought recounts shortly after the election, his own lawyers wrote: \"All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake.\" But he wouldn't listen, because he doesn't do irony. \n \nA few Republicans have roused themselves to protest Trump's idiocy. Mike Huckabee, a big supporter, told Fox News Business Network, \"I have no evidence whatsoever, and I don't know that anyone does, that there are that many illegal people who voted ... I'm not sure why he brought it up.\" \n \nSen. Lindsey Graham had the most substantive rebuke. \"I would urge the president to knock this off ... To continue to insist that the 2016 election was conducted in a fashion that millions of people voted illegally undermines faith in our democracy,\" Graham said. \"People are going to start doubting you as a person.\" \n \nBut, all too predictably, most Republicans reacted as if jelly had replaced their spines. In their lust to enact their long-stymied agenda (throwing people off Obamacare, gutting the EPA, etc.), they're apparently prepared to indulge Trump's serial lies and delusions. \n \nHis temperament is already a burgeoning issue. The anecdotes are piling up. But what's most remarkable about a recent Washington Post story about Trump's first week in office is the ninth paragraph: \"This account of Trump's tumultuous first days in office comes from interviews with nearly a dozen senior White House officials and other Trump advisers and confidants, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations and moments.\" In other words, Trump aides are already leaking like a sieve -- to the free and independent press that Trump hates. \n \nSo the question is: How long will Republicans indulge him before they man up to do their duty? Will they sit silent until he rants us to the brink of a needless war that could get a lot of people killed?

The \"sanitised\" report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nThe report, whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986.\n\nThe very first sentence of the report's available (undeleted) page reads: \"Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\" It, however, later clearly said that \"assassination is the major near-term threat\" to him.\n\nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991.\n\nThe first section titled \"Key Judgments\" analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India's relations with the US, the then USSR and the region.\n\nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi's life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder.\n\n\"If Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures - including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India - were taken by the Indian President ......(deleted),\" it said.\n\nInterestingly, it also names P V Narasimha Rao and V P Singh, who could be the \"interim successor\" and \"likely candidates\" in case of sudden exit by Rajiv. Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991.\n\nIn a section, titled 'The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy', the report says \"In our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\" besides \"a fanatical Hindu\".\n\nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis. However, another section deals in- depth with Rajiv's mediation efforts to resolve \"the conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"}],"title":"'CIA assessed Rajiv assassination 5 yrs before he was killed'","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Press Trust of India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169699931","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2055"},"name":"Press Trust of India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ptinews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196839095","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The defeat of Amendment 1 last fall by Georgia voters was a learning lesson for its proponents, including Gov. Nathan Deal, who invested a lot of political capital into its passage. \n \nChris Riley is Gov. Deal's chief of staff and a main architect of the proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed the state to create Opportunity School Districts and to assume management of schools deemed \"chronically failing,\" according to a state rating system. Sixty percent of voters flunked the amendment. \n \n\"We were very confident that the people of Georgia would see it as an effort by the governor to be able to fix failing schools,\" Riley told me in an interview at the state Capitol last week. \"We always thought we would be defined as helping -- that the parents, students, teachers would welcome assistance from the state. That didn't happen. The opposition controlled the message. Amendment 1 was defined not as helping failing schools but as a state 'takeover.'\" \n \nRiley blames the teachers' unions, which poured about $6 million into the campaign to defeat Amendment 1. That may be, but it didn't help that the Georgia PTA came out unanimously against the amendment as well as civil rights groups, not to mention scant editorial support. \n \n\"We dropped the ball on the messaging component.\" he admits. \"The teachers thought they were in the crosshairs. Shame on us for allowing teachers to think we were labeling them as 'status quo.' That was completely wrong. 'Status quo' are the administrators -- superintendents, principals, school boards -- who choose not to do anything. Not the teachers.\" \n \nRiley says, \"If you believe in local control and you have year-after-year of a school failing -- no gain. No one-tenth. No 5 percent. No gain at all. At some point, there has to be a change. Nobody wants to admit they have a failing school, but we have gone from 67 elementary schools in that category to 111, so doing nothing is not an alternative. That is not the teacher's fault. There has to be a change with the superintendent, principal, administrator -- somewhere there has to be a change.\" \n \nWas there a pony in the pile that was Amendment 1? Yes, Riley says. He points out that the TSPLOST (Transportation Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax) initiative in 2012, which was soundly defeated by voters in most parts of the state, got people to talking about the problem of transportation and resulted in the passage of legislation in 2015 that has put $1 billion into repair and maintenance of our state roads. \"While we did not achieve success with our idea to fix failing schools, our loss has educated everyone to the problem in Georgia. This is a good thing,\" he declares. \n \nThere is going to be another effort to construct a measure to deal with failing schools, but this time through legislation. Riley tells me the focus will be on elementary schools, specifically reading and math. \"You have to start with the youngest of the young,\" he says. \"That is what Sen. Tippins has been stressing for a long time.\" Lindsey Tippins, R-Cobb County, is chairman of the Senate Education and Youth Committee, and a key player in crafting legislation on the subject of failing schools, along with Rep. Brooks Coleman, R-Gwinnett, his legislative counterpart in the House. \n \nHow would the new initiative work? \"That is still being fleshed out in the proposed legislation,\" Riley says. \"You would probably work out something with the State Department of Education, something that doesn't require a Constitutional Amendment. You would see more local control and the option of having either independent audits or assessments done and then have some priorities placed on administrators -- not the teachers.\" One thought is that locally-conducted audits would be made publicly available to increase transparency and accountability. \n \nAs with any legislation of this magnitude, you need the buy-in of the lieutenant governor and the Speaker, both of whom say they are on board with the concept and awaiting the details. Riley also says he is working with House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, D-Atlanta, on some suggestions, particularly as it relates to poverty. \"Rep. Abrams has said she is going to give us her ideas because she knows we will listen to them,\" he says. \n \nBottom line: The issue of failing schools remains a priority with Gov. Deal, but this time, it will be dealt with through legislation, not by constitutional amendment. \n \nWhatever happens, suffice it to say a hard lesson has been learned. \n \nDick Yarbrough is a longtime Georgia resident and former public relations executive.

As firefighters battled the towering blaze, congregation members watched from the curb, overcome with emotion. Later, they prayed on the sidewalk across the street from the smoldering mosque. \n\n\"It's a house of worship,\" Shahid Hashmi, president of the center, said as he watched from across the street. \n\nThe mosque had hosted a congregational dinner only hours before, Hashmi said. \n\nThe fire attracted international media attention, fueled largely by its timing - only hours after President Donald Trump announced a ban on people from Muslim countries entering the United States. \n\nHowever, mosque spokesman Abe Ajrami urged people not to rush to judgment and spoke of the love and support his congregation felt from Victoria and beyond. \n\n\"We ask the public ... to please do not politicize the situation,\" Ajrami said. \"Please, give a chance to law enforcement. Let them take their time and do their job. We don't know what happened.\" \n\nFirefighters and several engines were dispatched at 2:13 a.m. to the burning building, 201 E. Airline Road, said Victoria Fire Chief Taner Drake. \n\nPaul Hulbert, a clerk at a nearby 7-Eleven convenience store and gas station, said he called the fire department  after he saw smoke and flames while taking out the trash. He said he noticed nothing suspicious at the mosque before or after the fire. \n\nDrake said the Victoria Fire Department was notified of the fire at 2:10 a.m. At 2:19 a.m., the first fire crews arrived and began to battle the blaze. \n\nBecause of the fire's intensity, firefighters us defensive strategies, spraying water from atop extended fire engine ladders instead of entering the burning building. By 4 a.m., the fire was under control, and the mosque was destroyed. \n\nAt an evening news conference, Drake said investigators have more questions than answers so far. \n\n\"Fire investigations are sometimes very, very tedious, and you have to literally look through all evidence with a fine-toothed comb,\" Drake said. \"That process can take days, weeks or even months to determine.\" \n\nThe Victoria Fire Marshal's Office will receive assistance from investigators from the State Fire Marshal's Office and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \n\nSeveral residents of East Hiller Street, a quiet neighborhood which lies adjacent to the mosque, reported witnessing nothing suspicious. \n\nLike many of her neighbors, Yvonne Rodriguez only noticed the mosque was burning when the building already was consumed by fire. \n\nHashmi said he was surprised by the intensity of the fire. The  building contained no significant amount of flammable materials to his knowledge, he said. \n\nThe mosque was burglarized Jan. 22, but Hashmi was unwilling to speculate the fire was the result of arson. The morning of the burglary, a rear door was smashed open and numerous electronics were stolen, including  iPads, laptops and smartphones. \n\nDrake said he could not yet say in what part of the building the fire likely started. But Rodriguez, said she thought the rear of the building appeared to burn the most stubbornly and intensely. \n\nAlthough Hashmi said the Victoria Islamic Center has received mostly support from the Victoria community, at least two incidents of vandalism have been documented. \n\nIn July 2013 , a teenager admitted to spraypainting \"H8,\" a computer shorthand for \"hate,\" on the center's exterior. \n\nHashmi said that vandalism was not the result of hate but rather boredom. The teen vandal was forgiven by the mosque's members after their parents discovered the crime. \n\nIn 2001, a pig's head was left on the the doorstep of the mosque, prompting the installation of security cameras. \n\nThose cameras were functioning when Saturday's fire broke out, Hashmi said, and the footage has been turned over to the Victoria Police Department. \n\nCompleted in 2000, the mosque has served about 2,000 members who have come and gone, Hashmi said. After the group was founded by Hashmi and two others in the early 1980s, prayers and events were held in a rental house, rather than a traditional mosque. \n\nMost recently, the center was home to about 130 congregation members and served as a place of worship and community gathering, Hashmi said. \n\nAlthough he said he was shaken by the fire, the mosque's president vowed the center will be rebuilt. \n\nAt Saturday's press conference, Ajrami expressed unwavering optimism and thanked those who had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to rebuild the structure. \n\n\"We are going to have a great open house in a few months,\" he said. \"You are all going to be invited.\" \n\nSHARE","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Mosque engulfed in fire; cause unknown (w/videos)","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Victoria","zipCode":"77901","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Victoria","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Victoria Advocate","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659016","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"719"},"name":"Victoria Advocate","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.victoriaadvocate.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196866751","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Suffolk","zipCode":"11768","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Northport","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Northport Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172088316","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Northport Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.northport.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695196872862","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:53:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22877259/20170128/091105/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1485654598-9499.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But there is a definite silver lining for taxpayers in the long term.\n\nIt is a recognition that CalPERS\u2019 previous assumption was overly optimistic. The system\u2019s own chief investment officer started warning last summer that after two consecutive years of very poor returns, CalPERS\u2019 long-term historical returns had fallen below its 7.5 percent target at the time. And CalPERS\u2019 investment adviser, Wilshire Associates, recently advised that it should not expect more than a 6.2 percent average investment return over the coming decade.\n\nThus, while a strong argument can be made that CalPERS\u2019 decision to lower its investment return assumption to 7 percent by 2020 still isn\u2019t enough, the system is now moving closer to a more realistic pricing of public worker pensions, which benefits taxpayers in the long term.\n\nHere\u2019s why: The higher the returns that California assumes the pension system will earn on its assets in the future, the lower the government\u2019s (read: taxpayers\u2019) contributions that are needed today.\n\nMaintaining an unrealistically high investment return assumption has some problematic long-term effects on taxpayers. It artificially lowers the pension contributions made today by the government and its employees, effectively pretending the pension promises made are lower than they actually are. But if a pension plan consistently earns less than its assumed rate of return on average\u2014which CalPERS has been doing\u2014then it accumulates unfunded liabilities (or pension debt) that simply get passed on to taxpayers down the road. And like most debt that accrues interest, paying the piper later is always more expensive than paying it now.\n\nKeeping CalPERS\u2019 assumed rate of return unreasonably high has benefited governments and unions at the expense of taxpayers left holding the bag for pension promises that have not been sufficiently saved for. Thus, the decision to lower the assumed rate of return from 7.5 percent to 7 percent will lower the long-run costs to taxpayers relative to what would have been expected under the previous rate.\n\nThe bad news is that, in the short term, taxpayers are still going to have to pay higher costs for the benefits that have been promised to the state and local employees working on their behalf, past and present.\n\nIt is also worrying that the reduced earnings assumption still probably isn\u2019t low enough to stop CalPERS from accumulating additional pension debt. It won\u2019t stop the debt financing of today\u2019s pension costs; it will merely lessen it.\n\nStill, the near-term pain may have a beneficial side effect in that taxpayers and politicians will be forced to confront the implications of a massive jump in pension costs that had already been on a slow and steady uptick for years and, by extension, the financial risks inherent in offering guaranteed retirement benefits. Hopefully, this accelerates the push for additional reforms designed to make the state\u2019s pension systems solvent and offer less costly and risky benefits to future government employees.\n\nLeonard Gilroy is senior managing director of Reason Foundation\u2019s Pension Integrity Project (reason.org).

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n\nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n\n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n\n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n\n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n\nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n\nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n\nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n\nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n\nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n\nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n\nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n\nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n\nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n\nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n\nReleased under special circumstances \n\nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n\nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n\n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n\nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n\nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n\nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n\nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n\n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n\n'The executive order is unlawful' \n\nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n\nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n\n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n\nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n\n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n\nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n\nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n\n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n\nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n\nLegality questioned \n\nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n\nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n\n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n\nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n\nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n\n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n\n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"DHS complies with judge to limit 'Muslim ban'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bristol","zipCode":"24201","state":"Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bristol","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WCYB-TV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"173643002","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"39"},"name":"WCYB-TV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wcyb.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196881553","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:32:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Actually, following the predictions of Nostradamus, one assumedly major nuclear confrontation will possibly happen in the area in which the aggressor is the one breaking the promise of not using the nuclear weapons or its violent power in any warfare. The sad tidings here would be how the naval fleets would go kept by other powers, and then they could get scattered due to the violence of the powerful blast.\n\nDuring the course of 2014 to present day 2015 we have seen a huge up-tick in global military action, in some countries we have even seen military personnel on the streets and in the homes and businesses of the people who they are paid to protect. We have seen global governments pushing and prodding each other into position of war via proxy wars, economic wars, as the war on humanity is what takes centre stage Enchanted LifePath Alternate Media Reports takes a closer look at exactly what countries are invoked in military procedures at home or abroad throughout the world.\n\nLETS LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE IN MORE DETAIL\n\nWith the world inching closer to war, many historians, Biblical scholars and fans of Nostradamus are pointing to the current Middle East conflict between Israel and Iran. Global alliances could quickly turn a 2-nation war into a regional war, and then into a world war. How would the US fair and who would be on our side? We divided the world based on current alliances to see how the two sides match up and who has the edge.\n\nThe following battle lines were researched and chosen exclusively by Whiteout Press. We used a number of criteria to make our decision for each nation. Among the items we considered were; current military alliances, religious affiliations, historical alliances, ethnic ties, trade relations and statements by national leaders right out of today\u2019s headlines.\n\nJudaism vs. Islam, Christian civil war\n\nAs the world map is laid out, one of the trends we immediately notice is that the former Soviet nations and their Eastern Orthodox Christian faith will follow-up on their current promise and come to the aid of their Islamic allies in any war against the United States. With the Soviets come the global Communists, including some right in America\u2019s backyard.\n\nThe Neutrals\n\nIt is inevitable that many nations will attempt to remain neutral. But in the global world we live in, there is no such thing as neutrality. Nations that can\u2019t fight for or buy their neutrality, like India and Switzerland, will simply be used like pawns in a chess game by the world\u2019s superpowers. We did take history into account and countries like Nepal, Nigeria and Sweden who have always fought for and won their neutrality during regional wars are labeled as neutral again here.\n\nOther neutral countries are marked that way for a different reason. Some countries around the globe are so devastated and disoriented by current civil wars, they have no functioning government able to take any side. Some might conclude that a few of these civil wars are the first wave of the possible coming World War 3. In many instances, the wars are between militant Christians and Islamic Jihadists.\n\nThe numbers and statistics\n\nWe\u2019ve left out nuclear weapons capabilities, as well as chemical and biological weapons. Nations don\u2019t typically disclose their actual arsenal and half the nuclear-armed countries still don\u2019t acknowledge they have the weapons of mass destruction. Another reason to leave them off the list is pure wishful thinking.

Cepeda (Photo: The Washington Post) \n  \n\u201cDisaggregation\u201d is not a word that rolls off the tongue easily. But the concept of separating a whole into its distinct parts is one that we should embrace when it comes to statistics about minorities. \n \nThe time when it was sufficient to break out data by simple race or ethnicity segments has past. Demographics and new sociological and scientific understanding about the people that make up the broad categories of black, Asian and Hispanic tell us that these labels are becoming increasingly blunt instruments when we look at public health and education policy. \n \nFor instance, what do we miss when we talk about health in the black community if we neglect to understand that the share of foreign-born black people, largely from Africa and the Caribbean, has grown from 3.1 percent of the black population in 1980 to 8.7 percent in 2013? According to the Pew Research Center, by 2060, 16.5 percent of the U.S. black population will be foreign-born. \n \nMORE CEPEDA: Read other columns by Esther J. Cepeda \n \nA 2011 study from the University of Michigan found that in order to track racial disparities in health, more attention needs to go to understanding the different groups. \n \nResearchers found that African-Americans, U.S.-born Caribbean blacks and Caribbean-born blacks had significantly different self-ratings of their health and self-reports of being diagnosed with a chronic physical health condition. And it\u2019s only logical that there might also be differences for migrants to the U.S. from Africa. \n \nLast summer, Asian-American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander civil rights organizations in California helped pass legislation requiring the state\u2019s institutions of higher education and public health to collect, analyze and report data for up to 42 subgroups of those three broad categories since the disparities among national-origin groups are so dramatic. \n \nWithout more nuanced collection and reporting of subgroup data, for example, differences such as those between older adult Chinese and Vietnamese elders (who have the most chronic health conditions) and Japanese elders (who have the least) may potentially mask the reality that Japanese women are nearly twice as likely to die of cancer as Asian Indian women. \n \nThese distinctions are as important in Hispanic populations, which can be separated out into foreign- vs. native-born, country of origin and language preference. \n \nA recent study by minority health researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine found that cardiovascular disease presents itself differently in Latinos from the three largest Hispanic subgroups, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans and Cubans. \n \nMore Mexicans (19.5 percent) and Puerto Ricans (16.4 percent) died at a young age (25-49 years) vs. Cubans (5.3 percent) and non-Hispanic white people (6.6 percent), according to mortality data. But while cardiovascular disease was the leading cause of death in all subgroups, a higher portion of deaths in the Cuban subgroup (37.6 percent) were a result of heart disease. \n \n\u201cDifferences in cardiovascular disease mortality across the three largest Hispanic subgroups in the United States (Mexicans, Puerto Ricans and Cubans) are particularly intriguing because these distinct groups vary widely in immigration histories, socioeconomic status, culture, lifestyles and risk factors,\u201d Dr. Fatima Rodriguez of the division of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford and colleagues wrote. They concluded that \u201caggregation of Hispanics as a single group fails to capture important differences in cardiovascular disease outcomes for this increasingly important and growing segment of the population.\u201d \n \nThis plays itself out in education, as well. For years now, Asian advocacy groups have been trying to break the stereotype of the \u201cmodel minority student\u201d because it fails to take into account lower-income segments of the population such as the Vietnamese and Cambodians. When lumped in with traditional high achievers like the Chinese and Japanese, students with fewer resources can miss out on the educational support necessary to succeed. \n \nA recent Stanford University and Economic Policy Institute study found that while Asian students generally attend schools that have lower levels of poverty even than those attended by white students, poor Asian students are much more likely to attend high-poverty schools than poor white students. \n \nThe same study found that non-English-language-learner Hispanic students perform nearly as well as their white counterparts of similar socioeconomic background. On a 100-point test, these Hispanics were only the equivalent of 5 points behind in eighth-grade math tests in 2013. \n \nComparing gaps in quality-of-life factors between minorities and whites will always be an effective gauge of disparity or progress. But neglecting wide-ranging differences within the individual groups will only worsen inequality in America. \n \nEsther Cepeda\u2019s email address is estherjcepeda@washpost.com. \n \nRead or Share this story: http://desert.sn/2jJ84E9","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Esther J.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.

Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

(Photo: Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun) Buy Photo \n  \nWe contribute to Palm Springs \n \nMy husband and I live part time in Australia, and part time in Palm Springs. Until we win the green card lottery we have a three-month visa each year spent actively participating in the community, neighborhood association, and volunteering at events and festivals. \n \nWe have lovingly restored our home back to its vintage roots and proudly had it included on the Modernism Week home tour. \n \nTo keep our home looking as beautiful as our neighbours and neighbourhood deserve, we have gardening, pool maintenance, pest control and concierge garbage collection services all year. \n \nWe could not possibly afford to keep our Palm Springs home, or pursue our dream of retiring to Palm Springs, if our house was not used as a vacation rental during our absence. \n \nIn six years we have never had a complaint from our neighbors. We have contributed thousands of dollars to the city in fees and taxes. \n \nI am strongly in favor of strict rules being enforced regarding \u201cparty houses\u201d and noise issues with vacation homes.

God help us! \n \nNot going to a celebration does not show disrespect for the office of the presidency nor a lack of willingness to work with the new administration. Thanks for having the conviction and fortitude to exercise your right to protest. Nothing juvenile about that! \n \nEd Denson, Palm Springs \n \nRep. Ruiz, you\u2019re fired \n \nWhere were you? I didn\u2019t see you at the inauguration. As a representative representing me I expected you to be at the inauguration. \n \nYou work for me, not the Democratic Party or for yourself. \n \nYou were hired for a job; I expect you to show up for the job and part of the job description is attending events like the inauguration. \n \nLike any job there are things you are not going to like and if you don\u2019t show up you get fired. It is obvious that you do not want the job of respresentative. The only thing for you to do is resign. \n \nResigning would be the honorable thing to do. \n \nIt would appear Hillary Clinton made illegal millions in her pay for play scam. You are out of touch with the real world and your reasoning for not going is made up of nonsense. In the real world things are not going to go your way and you are not going to have the best bosses. Get over it. \n \nYou really don\u2019t care about all your constituents as your actions so signified. So I am firing you as my representative. \n \nDiana Gomez, Indio \n \nI\u2019d vote to recall \n \nCongressman Raul Ruiz\u2019s response regarding his not going to the inauguration showed his absolute smallness and I hope those who voted for him will not do so again. He actually thinks this was about Trump and about himself. \n \nHe\u2019s so wrong. This was about us, the American people and our traditions, and our respect for this wonderful country. \n \nHow self-centered can he be to think this was all about him and how he feels about what Trump says and does! His job is to represent us and he has failed miserably. I wish he could be recalled. \n \nMarilyn Loewy, Palm Desert \n \nRep. Ruiz failed test \n \nIn his letter to The Desert Sun published on Inauguration Day, Rep. Raul Ruiz states he has \u201cunlimited respect for the office of the presidency and the will of the American people\u201d and that his decision to forego the inauguration \u201cwas not based on partisanship.\u201d He goes on to state he would have \u201cproudly attended\u201d if any other Republican had won the election. \n \nSo it\u2019s personal for Rep. Ruiz \u2013 doesn\u2019t like the man, his politics or his perceived behavior. Respectfully, congressman, if that were the test do you think the Clintons, Carters and Obamas would have attended. \n \nYour political and personal views caused you to miss the point. As you should know, the inauguration is the symbol of the orderly and peaceful transition of power that sets our country and our form of democracy apart from the rest of the world. Your congressional responsibility and civic duty was to attend. Be silent or express your displeasure and disagreement if you wish, but attend nonetheless. \n \nIt was a time for you, Rep. Ruiz, to act like a United States congressman and not like a petulant child or politician. \n \nAllan Starr, Palm Desert \n \nRuiz deserves respect, too \n \nAll of you who wrote letters talked about respect. But you didn\u2019t show much to Rep. Raul Ruiz. \n \nWe must remember that the congressman is a human being first, an American citizen second, and our representative third. \n \nTo fault him for not attending the inauguration would be to tell him to give up his concerns and values. How can he embrace a man who belittles veterans, our intelligence agencies, civil rights heroes, free press, the congressman\u2019s heritage, women, the handicapped, three of our former presidents (Obama, Bush and Clinton), efforts to deal with the climate situation, religious minorities, and the list goes on? \n \nWhat Ruiz did was not a Republican or a Democrat thing What he did was exercise his Constitutional right to patriotically and peacefully protest. We believe that we are so lucky to have a congressman who won\u2019t sit by and idly accept unacceptable behavior of the leader of this nation. Since Ruiz has been in office his actions have always been bipartisan. \n \nKen and Dawn Rashid, Palm Desert \n \nMore should\u2019ve boycotted \n \nGrowing up, Mom did not say, \u201cYou\u2019re a Republican so you must respect everyone.\u201d She did not say, \u201cYou\u2019re a Democrat so you must respect everyone.\u201d She simply said, \u201cRespect others and they will respect you.\u201d Mom also said to \u201cAlways tell the truth and not be afraid to stand up for what you know is right in your heart.\u201d \n \nCongressman Ruiz must have heard my mother speaking as I did 70-plus years ago. His decision to not attend the inauguration of a man who demeans women, who misrepresents facts repeatedly, who shows racial, religious, and sexual orientation prejudice, who believes Putin can be his friend, and who believes he is above all others and need not provide tax returns or divest himself of his business interests, should be commended. \n \nCongressman Ruiz shows he is a man of principle by standing up for those \u201cinalienable rights\u201d guaranteed to all Americans in the Constitution. His decision should be praised as it shows he is standing up for all Americans, not just Republicans or Democrats. \n \nWhat we need in government are more men and women like him. \n \nBonnie Chafe, Cathedral City \n \nTrump acts justify boycott \n \nI support Rep. Raul Ruiz and the decision he made regarding the presidential inauguration. To attend the inauguration was to normalize a situation and a person which cannot or should not be normalized. Donald Trump\u2019s reprehensible behavior, bigoted remarks, misogynistic attitude and apparent inability to tell the truth and/or accept responsibility for his actions cannot be considered acceptable behavior of the person chosen to lead the United States. \n \nThose who wrote in opposition to Rep. Ruiz\u2019s stating he should have attended to represent the members of his district seem to overlook the fact that many of Dr. Ruiz\u2019s constituents were the target of Trump\u2019s wrath, lies and general unacceptable behavior. As a member of one of the groups targeted by Trump I thank Rep. Ruiz for his bravery and willingness to stand up for his principles and for mine. \n \nI spent my working life in health care and education. I am appalled with Donald Trump\u2019s choices to lead those departments. I believe Rep. Ruiz must continue his vigilance and opposition of policies which will hurt those he represents. \n \nPerhaps we might agree, going forward, that we should show Trump the same respect he showed President Obama. \n \nMary M. Callahan, Rancho Mirage \n \nRuiz the right model \n \nRep. Raul Ruiz has been roundly criticized on these pages for not respecting the office of president or not supporting a peaceful transition of administrations with his personal decision to boycott the inaugural events for President Donald Trump. \n \nOur current role model for respectful presidential behavior is a man who has insulted, mocked, undermined, lied, ignored and personalized the entire 18-month process of electing a new president of the United States of America. \n \nSurely Dr. Ruiz has a right to act on his lifelong principles for one day without howls of outrage from his critics. \n \nLee Colby, Palm Desert \n \nA courageous example \n \nFour living ex-presidents attended the inauguration of Donald Trump. These men represented the country as a whole, and it is fitting that their attendance showed respect for the office they had shared. \n \nCongressman Raul Ruiz, however, represents the citizens of his district, many of whom are not the white, wealthy conservative Christians who are expected to benefit most from the new administration. \n \nI applaud Dr. Ruiz\u2019s decision to make a statement by boycotting the inauguration. I see this as a measure of respect for those of us who are women, minorities, immigrants, of lower or middle socio-economic level, LGBT, handicapped, and/or of other faiths. Many of us have felt dismissed, discouraged and dismayed by candidate Trump\u2019s words and tweets and look forward to his presidency with trepidation. \n \nWe are fortunate to have such a courageous and ethical person as Raul Ruiz representing our diverse population and interests in Washington. \n \nSharon Miller, Palm Desert \n \nRuiz has rights, too \n \nI congratulate and support Dr. Raul Ruiz\u2019s position in not attending the inauguration. His decision was supported by the millions in the USA and the world who marched to demonstrate against Donald Trump\u2019s numerous falsehoods and policies that will have a negative affect on those less affluent than he is. \n \nDr. Ruiz demonstrated what he believes in. Fortunately, by living in the U.S. we are allowed to stand for our beliefs, which is in direct contrast to the Russian people who cannot voice their opinions without severe consequences. \n \nKay Bell, Rancho Mirage \n \nI stand with President Trump \n \nEnough is enough! \n \nI have been silent too long to not speak on behalf of President Trump. After eight years of unprecedented liberalism in the White House, we finally have a president with conservative views. Those against President Trump have fought against him before he announced, after he announced and again after he scored one of the biggest upsets in presidential elections in the history of the U.S.A. \n \nMost celebrities detest President Trump and have not stopped clamoring for his removal. There are a number of people who, as I, support President Trump. Some of these people are: Clint Eastwood; Toby Keith; Kirstie Alley; Jon Voight; Loretta Lynn; Terrell Owens; Ben Carson; Marie Osmond; Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson; Jackie Evancho; Big and Rich; Three Doors Down; Lee Greenwood; The Rockettes; The Mormon Tabernacle Choir; (partial list). \n \nI support the above mentioned people and others who voted for President Trump. I am proud to be a member of the American Independent Party and a U.S. Marine. \n \nI will be forwarding this letter to President Trump and all those listed above. Included will be my resume and my commitment to volunteer for our president. \n \nMatt Monica, Palm Desert \n \nDemanded vs. earned \n \nYou do not march for respect, you earn respect. \n \nHow far we have fallen from the greatest generation to the pampered generation. \n \nJohn Beal, Indian Wells \n \nWe\u2019re with you, Rep. Ruiz \n \nRep. Raul Ruiz showed deep respect for the office of president by refusing to witness that office profaned by the entrance into it of a man egregious in his disrespect for Blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, women, and immigrants; a man who cheated vulnerable students and workers out of their money; a man who honors a Russian thug over NATO and the entire American intelligence community; a man who brags about repeated criminal assaults on women; and a man who has indicated he would have refused to concede had the election gone against him and who did all he could to discredit the legitimacy of his predecessor with his lies about President Obama\u2019s place of birth. \n \nTrump\u2019s own disrespect for the office he shamefully holds makes many fearful and disgusted as evidenced by the millions who gathered throughout this country and the rest of the world to march in protest. Rep. Ruiz, we\u2019re with you on this one! \n \nLuc Agosta and Bud Sydenstricker, Palm Springs \n \nIt\u2019s about service \n \nOn April 24, 1968, I reported to the Oakland Induction Center as ordered by the president of the United States. \n \nI served on U.S. soil for five months and saw many of my Army friends being deployed to Vietnam. I then decided to volunteer. I had not chosen this course, but it was my duty, my responsibility and my country. \n \nCongressman Ruiz, as distasteful a sacrifice as attending OUR President\u2019s inauguration may have been to you, it pales in comparison to the 58,000 patriots who gave their lives in Vietnam, the 300,000 wounded and more than 60,000 men and women who committed suicide upon returning home to a nation torn with political strife. \n \nAnd despite it all, our military continues to serve our country, undaunted, by those in Washington, D.C. who have forgotten the basic meaning of serving a greater cause. \n \nCarl J. Cieslikowski, Vietnam 1969-70, Palm Desert \n \n\nA group effort \n \nMay I appeal to every citizen and every resident of the U.S.A. to offer up The Lord\u2019s Prayer each day for our country. \n \n\u201cOur Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Gloucester Advocate","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169693234","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Gloucester Advocate","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gloucesteradvocate.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196891314","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

(Photo: BBC) \n  \nKeystone XL is back \u2014 along with the usual misconceptions about its virtues and dangers. There should be no doubt, however, that President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order advancing the project is a good thing. \n \nThe reason is simple: By carrying heavy crude from the oil sands of Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast and beyond, Keystone XL would strengthen U.S. energy security. \n \nKeystone would not, as Trump suggests, create a lot of work for Americans. It will take maybe 10,000 people to build the pipeline, and those jobs will be temporary. Only a few dozen will be needed once it is operational. \n \nAt the same time, many environmentalists\u2019 warnings about Keystone are exaggerated. Pipelines are a safe, reliable and efficient way to carry oil. Given that Keystone would be built to the latest safety requirements, it would be less spill-prone than the tens of thousands of miles of older pipelines that crisscross the U.S. (This advantage also holds true for the Dakota Access pipeline, another project Trump advanced Tuesday.) \n \nKeystone opponents also make more universal objections. Crude extracted from oil sands generates more than its share of greenhouse gases, because more energy is needed to remove the sand and dilute it for transport. Technology is already limiting this problem, however. Moreover, oil-sands emissions can be offset with reductions in other parts of the economy -- a likely scenario now that Canada has agreed to reduce carbon emissions as part of the Paris climate-change agreement, and Alberta has adopted a carbon tax. \n \nFinally, many environmentalists argue that pipelines such as Keystone only encourage the further extraction and use of fossil fuels, which contribute to global warming. Regardless of whether this will prove to be true, the reality is that there aren\u2019t enough sources of clean energy to meet the world\u2019s needs. And to protect against price shocks, it is preferable for the U.S. to get its oil from domestic sources or from friendly neighbors like Canada. \n \nWith or without Keystone, in any case, crude will continue to be extracted from the Alberta oil sands. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently approved two new pipelines designed to carry that oil through Canada to world markets. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order does not amount to approval for Keystone -- the company behind the project will have to submit another application -- and there is always a danger, Trump being Trump, that he will make unreasonable demands. On Tuesday he suggested that he wants to the pipeline to use only American steel, and in the past he has vowed to demand a share of the pipeline\u2019s profits. \n \nThis would be unwise. Better not to jeopardize a decision that can be justified as a matter of both energy and economic policy and see to it that the pipeline, now almost a decade on the drawing board, is finally built. \n \n\u2014 Bloomberg View \n \nRead or Share this story: http://arnne.ws/2jJuiWj","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Bloomberg View"},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Pipeline pro: Keystone XL still is worth building","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Taylor","zipCode":"79601","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Abilene","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Abilene Reporter","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169730061","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"269"},"name":"Abilene Reporter","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://reporternews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://arnne.ws/2jJuiWj"],"sequenceId":"695196894706","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Trump and his team insisted the order was not intended to target Islam and its followers, but the hashtag #muslimban trended, and many Muslims both in America and abroad said they viewed the measure as a broadly conceived and stinging exclusion.\n\nCapping a day of high-stakes drama, a federal judge in New York, Ann M. Donnelly, ordered a halt to deportations of travelers who arrived at airports with valid visas to enter the U.S., saying that sending them back to the affected countries could cause them \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d But she did not rule on the legality of the executive order, nor did she say that others who have not yet arrived in the U.S. can be allowed to proceed.\n\nOpponents of the president\u2019s directive vowed to seek a wider court win. Lawyers from groups including the American Civil Liberties Union said they intended to press ahead with efforts to overturn the president\u2019s overall order on constitutional grounds. And they rejoiced at their early victory.\n\n\u201cClearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country,\u201d said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero. \u201cOn week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d\n\nIn a separate and more limited ruling, a federal judge in Virginia ordered a weeklong stay against removing people with permanent U.S. residency who had been detained under the presidential order at Washington Dulles International Airport.\n\nAs the directive\u2019s effects spread, thousands staged spontaneous protests against refugee detention at airports across the country, including in Los Angeles and San Francisco. At New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, demonstrators waved signs and read from the famous Emma Lazarus poem inscribed in the Statue of Liberty.\n\nAt more than a dozen airports, including Los Angeles, Newark, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and Atlanta, immigration attorneys stepped up in droves to offer free services to those detained. \u201cA lot of tears and emotion here,\u201d said Hassan Ahmad, a lawyer from northern Virginia who hustled to Dulles airport.\n\nThe New York order appeared to affect the 100 to 200 people who were detained in transit to the United States. While the order will prevent them from being sent home, it was less clear whether they will have to remain in detention while their asylum cases are being decided.\n\nOne of the two detained Iraqis named in the case, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was an interpreter who had worked on behalf of the U.S. government. Freed after 19 hours in custody, he wept as he spoke to reporters, thanking supporters and calling America \u201cthe land of freedom, the land of rights.\u201d\n\nThe groups bringing the legal challenge, who also included the International Refugee Assistance Project and the National Immigration Law Center, said a separate motion sets the stage for a larger action involving other would-be refugees, visitors and immigrants stopped at other ports of entry.\n\nArab American advocacy groups also were reacting to the new order, warning that it was disrupting travel all over the world.\n\n\u201cWe see complete chaos in the way this has been implemented,\u201d Abed A. Ayoub, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said in a conference call with reporters.\n\nThe directive, he said, had caught up not only desperate refugees who had thought themselves within a hairsbreadth of safety, but many more with already established lives, homes and families in the United States. \u201cThis order needs to be rescinded,\u201d he said.\n\nIn another legal challenge, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would file a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. The suit, to be filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Virginia, argues that the executive order is unconstitutional because of its apparent aim of singling out Muslims.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that refugees \u2014 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2014 are a threat to national security,\u201d the group\u2019s national litigation director, Lena F. Masri, said in a statement. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d\n\nThe order, signed Friday by Trump during a visit to the Pentagon, suspends all refugee entries for 120 days. In addition, it indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees and bars entry to the U.S. for 90 days for those traveling from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nProminent Muslim figures raised their voices in opposition to the temporary refugee ban, saying children would be among those suffering the most from it.\n\nNobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by the Taliban, said in a statement that she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d that Trump was closing the door on \u201cchildren, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said the travel ban also covered holders of green cards, who are authorized to live and work in the U.S. Some reports have put the number of such permanent residents from the affected countries as high as half a million.\n\nAn administration official said that current green card holders from the affected countries would be allowed to remain in the U.S. \u2014 but that those caught outside the country at the time of the ban\u2019s imposition would have to be allowed back in on a case-by-case basis. Those with business overseas will have to meet beforehand with a consular official.\n\nThe measure\u2019s scope was also widened by a State Department announcement that dual nationals from the seven affected countries who also held passports from third countries such as Britain or Canada could be blocked \u2014 in effect denying U.S. entry to citizens of closely allied nations.\n\nAs the measure\u2019s far-reaching impact became clear, and the airport chaos mounted throughout the day, Trump denied it was a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and said the process was going smoothly. \u201cWe were totally prepared,\u201d he told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely, and we\u2019re going to have a very, very strict ban.\u201d\n\nThe move has hit the technology industry, which employs thousands of foreign-born workers, many from Muslim-majority countries. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai on Friday slammed Trump\u2019s executive order in a memo to employees, saying about 100 employees were affected, and advising those traveling abroad to reach out to the company\u2019s immigration teams for assistance.\n\nInvestors and start-up employees are worried as well. Tech workers from countries such as Egypt and Jordan fear the list could soon expand to include their countries.\n\nThe entertainment world felt repercussions, too. It\u2019s uncertain whether Iranian filmmaker and Oscar nominee Asghar Farhadi will be able to attend next month\u2019s Academy Awards ceremony, though there are artistic waivers to the ban.\n\nRelatives wondered when they would see loved ones again. Iranian American Milad Sharifpour, a physician at Emory University in Atlanta, was worried for his brother, Ali Reza, a green card holder who was in Tehran visiting family when the directive took effect. \u201cI am sad, I\u2019m upset, and I feel very frustrated,\u201d Sharifpour said.\n\nMany feared that what they intended as temporary trips abroad could become prolonged ordeals. A Syrian clarinetist who lives in New York and holds permanent U.S. residency was in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, for a concert when the order took effect.\n\nIt left him unsure whether he would be able to go back to his Brooklyn apartment, he said, \u201clet alone all the concerts and residencies I have in the U.S. in the coming few months.\u201d\n\nHe asked not to be identified, because he will soon be trying to return to the U.S.\n\n\u201cI am not sure how to describe how I feel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is certainly not about me; it is about so many individuals whose lives were deeply affected.\u201d The United Nations human rights agency issued a statement calling the long-standing U.S. refugee resettlement program \u201cone of the most important in the world.\u201d It called on the Trump administration to ensure the U.S. \u201cwill continue its strong leadership role and long tradition of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race,\u201d the group said.\n\nAcross the United States, refugee advocates scrambled to ascertain the status of those who were already en route or about to leave when the order came down. A total of 30 refugees were scheduled to arrive in Atlanta next week from Somalia, Afghanistan, Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nAll had gone through months of security checks.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d said J.D. McCrary, executive director of the International Rescue Committee\u2019s Atlanta office. \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with anything like this ever happening on such a mass scale in the entire history of this program. Slamming the door on those fleeing persecution is deeply un-American.\u201d\n\nIn Congress, reaction to the immigration chaos tended to break down along party lines, with vociferous criticism from Democrats while Republicans largely remained silent.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Trump had chosen a \u201cdark path,\u201d while both Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco said the Statue of Liberty would have wept.\n\nOne of the few Republicans to speak out against the directive was Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who said the order could play into the hands of jihadist groups by being excessively sweeping in nature.\n\n\u201cWhile not technically a Muslim ban, this order is too broad,\u201d Sasse said in a statement.\n\nAirports overseas and in the U.S. found themselves at ground zero for the spreading chaos. Five members of one Iraqi family, along with a Yemeni, were prevented from boarding flights in Cairo.\n\nAt the Frankfurt airport in Germany, a major hub for travel from the Middle East and onward to Europe and the U.S., more were stranded. A German radio network quoted federal police as saying that 20 people from all seven countries on the list were stuck in the airport\u2019s transit zone, unable to board flights for the U.S.\n\nIn Atlanta, a growing cluster of family members and lawyers gathered Saturday at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after at least five permanent U.S. residents who had traveled to Iran on vacation were detained by federal immigration officials.\n\nMansour Kenareh, 55, an Iranian software engineer who lives in Suwanee, Ga., said his brother-in law, his wife and their 10-year-old child had been detained after returning from a vacation in Tehran to visit family.\n\n\"They have green cards, they have bank accounts, they have a house here,\" Kenareh said as he paced the arrivals hall of the international terminal after an unfruitful visit to a Customs and Border Protection office. Officials, he said, had detained the family for more than five hours, even though they had lived legally in the U.S. for more than a year. \n\nSarah Owings, an immigration attorney, said that she had not been allowed to meet with the detained immigrants at the Atlanta airport. \n\n\u201cThese are people who live here; they have houses, they have dogs, cars,\u201d Owings said. \"This should not be happening. They can't send back a permanent resident without a hearing.\"\n\nLate Saturday, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said that all 11 people who were detained at the airport had been cleared and released.\n\nIn Europe, there was blowback from U.S. allies, who have absorbed a wave of refugees over the last two years and are already deeply unhappy with Trump for disparaging the NATO alliance and predicting the breakup of the European Union.\n\n\u201cWhen he rejects the arrival of refugees while Europe has done its duty, we should respond to him,\u201d said French President Francois Hollande.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, well aware of Trump\u2019s evangelical Christian base of support, said pointedly, \u201c\u2018Love thy neighbor\u2019 is part of this tradition, the act of helping others.\u201d\n\nOn social media, users bemoaned what they said was a blow to what remained of the world\u2019s respect for American ideals.\n\n\u201cFascism USA 2017,\u201d tweeted Mona Eltahawy, an Egyptian American author and activist.\n\nThe prospect of reciprocal measures was raised almost immediately \u2014 a factor that could potentially affect Americans including aid workers, tourists and business travelers. Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry, condemning Trump\u2019s order, said Saturday that Iran \u201creserves the right of reciprocity,\u201d official outlets reported.\n\nTrump\u2019s move could also dampen hopes for negotiating the release of U.S. citizens held in any of the affected countries. Several Americans of Iranian descent are imprisoned in Iran on spy charges.\n\nHave the women\u2019s marches started a movement?

(Photo: BBC) \n  \nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s executive actions Tuesday to revive the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline \u2014 two environmental flashpoints doused by the Obama administration \u2014 should not have come as a surprise to anyone. He promised to do so during the campaign, and his support is consistent with his desire to make the U.S. oil and gas industry more productive. \n \nNevertheless, there are good reasons to oppose both projects. \n \nThe Keystone pipeline would move 830,000 barrels of oil a day through the American heartland, creating hundreds of short-term construction jobs while encouraging a particularly dirty form of oil extraction. President Obama eventually scuttled the project as contrary to \u201cthe national interest\u201d of combating global warming. The Dakota Access Pipeline, whose builders include a company in which Trump until recently invested, would carry 500,000 barrels a day over an 1,100-mile pipeline, including under a dammed stretch of the Missouri River from which the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation draws its water. After dramatic protests, the Army Corps of Engineers denied a key permit and directed that alternative routes be explored. \n \nIn signing his declarations, Trump zeroed in on the jobs that would be created, which meshes with his pledge to invest in the nation\u2019s sagging infrastructure while getting more people more work. But not all infrastructure is created equal; some of it serves our long-term interests, and some of it decidedly does not. Promoting the use of fossil fuels, and especially the ones pulled from Canada\u2019s tar sands, fall into the latter category. \n \nIn addition to reviving the pipelines, Trump signed another action seeking to streamline what he described as \u201cthe incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process \u2026 for domestic manufacturing.\u201d Streamlining of regulations might be a good thing \u2014 but only if the projects are fully vetted and, when approved, do not cause undue harm to the environment. \n \nSadly, Trump has displayed little concern for the environment, and significant contempt for environmental regulations. His order freezing all new business activities by the Environmental Protection Agency should worry the 56 percent of Americans who think environmental concerns should outweigh economic ones. Similarly, Trump nominated as head of the EPA someone who has sued to block the agency more than a dozen times, and selected the former head of Exxon Mobil as secretary of State. \n \nThe national interest \u2014 the world\u2019s interest, for that matter \u2014 is not best-served by speeding the investment in infrastructure that makes it cheaper and easier to burn fossil fuels. The U.S. should be encouraging investment in the infrastructure of wind, solar and other renewable energy sources. \n \nTrump needs to get his head out of the oil sands, and face the reality of climate change. \n \n\u2014 Los Angeles Times \n \nRead or Share this story: http://arnne.ws/2jDlu6V","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Los Angeles Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Pipeline con: Focus on cleaner energy projects","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Taylor","zipCode":"79601","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Abilene","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Abilene Reporter","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169730061","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"269"},"name":"Abilene Reporter","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://reporternews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://arnne.ws/2jDlu6V"],"sequenceId":"695196895498","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Although they only led in the final minutes of the game, they were able to complete the comeback and move to 16-1. \n \nThe No. 1 2A Vikings didn't put anyone into double figures and shot just 6-11 from the free throw line, but were able to find enough heart to win, 43-41 over the visiting Pike Central Chargers (9-6). \n \n\"That was a very different Pike Central team than we faced at the Graber Post (Classic). They made it very difficult to get the ball into Trevor (Lengacher) and they played some great defense. It turned into a street fight for awhile,\" said B-R coach Bryan Hughes. \"We are going to have to realize that teams are going to get into us and start guarding us differently in the post. \n \n\"I give our kids a lot of credit for hanging in there. I thought Keegan (O'Neill) played well and I thought Kolten Graber gave us a big basket. The one thing I was disappointed with was our free throw shooting in the double bonus.\" \n \nPike Central took an early 4-0 lead, all from senior Gabe Elliott, and giving him his 1,000th career point.  Although Javan Miller and Lengacher added buckets, PC pushed it to 11-4.  O'Neill got on the board for the Vikings, but PC was able to extend it to 18-6 and end the quarter on a 9-0 run. \n \nLengacher and Gabe Gladish combined for the first five points of the second quarter and cut the Charger lead to seven. An O'Neill \"and 1\" cut the Viking deficit to just four with 4:00 left in the half. \n \nBryant Nalley accounted for all seven Charger points of the quarter, but B-R was able to trim the margin back to five, 25-20, after a pair of Gladish free throws. \n \nO'Neill was able to cut the lead back to three, however PC was able to move it back to five throughout much of the quarter, before Colten White and Elliott gave them an eight-point lead with 2:24 left in the third. The Chargers were able to go up by 10 when B-R missed six straight shots. However, O'Neill added his second basket of the quarter, but B-R was still down 34-26 with eight minutes to play. \n \nThe Vikings began a fourth quarter rally with a jumper from Austin Ainscough and a trey from Gladish to get it back to five with 6:00 to play. Jon Walker added a trey that cut it to two. \n \nAfter a questionable call, B-R was given a technical and PC was able to go up by three. After baskets from Ainscough and Lengacher, B-R had its first lead of the night with 2:45 left. \n \nGraber pushed the lead to three and a Walker rebound gave the Vikings the lead and the ball with 2:00 left.  B-R missed three of its next four free throws and Elliott made the front end, but the Chargers were still only able to cut the margin to three. Miller added one, but a trey from Elliott kept the Chargers in the game with :18.3 left to play. \n \nMiller added a free throw to make it 43-41 and PC rimmed out the long trey at the buzzer, as the Vikings completed the comeback. \n \nNo Viking made it to double figures. \n \nLengacher and O'Neil posted nine points each, Gladish had eight and  Ainscough had six. Walker had five, Miller four and Kolten Graber had a very important two points. \n \nThe Chargers were led by 14 each for Elliott and Nalley. \n \nB-R took the JV game, 44-39, which saw the younger Vikings down by as much as 15, before collecting the win. Quentin Yoder led with 15 points, while Kam Graber had 12. \n \nBarr-Reeve takes to the road for three straight games, beginning with Jasper on Thursday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"mbrunson@washtimesherald.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"BR overcomes deficits, hangs on for victory over Chargers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Daviess","zipCode":"47501","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Washington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Washington Times-Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169762340","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Washington Times-Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.washtimesherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196907663","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:07:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/washtimesherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/13/51354a24-e5c4-11e6-8550-1bf43217e95e/588d4d8b811f9.image.jpg?resize=300%2C451"}],"video":[]}}

(WTHR) - Rescuers risked their lives trying to save four young girls from an early morning fire in Flora. The sisters, ranging in age from 4 to 12, died in the fire. \n \nThe girls' mother was injured, along with two law enforcement officers who tried to save the girls. \n \nInvestigators say they still don\u2019t know what caused the deadly fire at a duplex on East Columbia Street. According to a source, they are focusing on the home\u2019s electrical system. \n \nNeighbors say they saw the smoke then heard the screams. Chasity Fox described a mother hollering for someone to save her babies and then the children yelling back. \n \n\u201cIt is going to have an impact on the community forever,\" she said \u201cI am always going to have the screaming in my heart and my mind. We were all praying on our front porch and praying God would just help and move and the children out and I guess God had other plans.\u201d \n \nAt 3:30 in the morning, the house was in flames. Two lawmen went in, trying to save the children. One nearly died. \n \nCarroll County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Drew Yoder was burned and suffered serious smoke inhalation. Flora Police officer Josh Disinger pulled him out of the house to safety. \n \nSheriff Tobe Leazenby spoke with Eyewitness News about Disinger's quick actions. If it hadn\u2019t been for him, \u201cI honestly would hate to think of the outcome,\" The sheriff answered. \n \nAs of 8:30 p.m. Monday, Deputy Yoder was still in the burn unit. Authorities said doctors aren't worried about the burns on his face or hands - those look good - so much as the respiratory burns. Sheriff Leazenby said the next 24-48 hours are crucial. \n \nOfc. Disinger was released from the hospital. \n \nLocal and state fire investigators labored most of the day searching for exactly where and how the fire started. State Fire Marshal Jim Greeson inspected the scene himself and consulted with investigators. Nothing jumped out at them. \n \n\u201cWe are taking each of the rooms and looking at them independently to look for all possible causes,\" he said. \n \nThe four children, all sisters, ranged in age from preschool to the 6th grade. \n \nTheir mother survived with serious injuries. A friend, Jennifer Endress, said the single mom worked in a local gas station convenience store. \n \n\u201cShe is an awesome, awesome, awesome person. She would help anybody even though she has four girls on her own,\" Endress explained. \n \nAn unimaginable loss for any community is an unbearable tragedy for a community of just 2,000 people. \n \nDerek Jackson, Assistant Chief of the Burlington Fire Department, said firefighters from a dozen volunteer departments assisted Flora\u2019s fire department. \n \n\u201cThese are beyond community crushers. It\u2019s not just this small town of Flora. It is the whole county,\" Jackson said. \n \nA group counseling session was scheduled for Monday night for first responders who fought the fire together, joined together again to wrestle with their grief. \n \nDeputy Drew Yoder \n  \nGreeson praised the efforts of the police officers who tried to rescue the children. \n\n\"I want to thank those two police officers who risked their lives to try to save these four children, and that mother, and get them out of the house. I know they risk their lives daily in what they do, but today and this morning, above and beyond the call,\" said Greeson, who also thanked local fire departments. \n\nInvestigators with the Indiana State Fire Marshal, which is part of the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, will continue the investigation. \n \nThere is no suspicion of foul play at this point, according to investigators. K-9 units were brought in to search for traces of accelerants and none were found. One working smoke alarm was found in the house. \n \nThere is no time table for when a cause will be determined. The names of the deceased are not being released at this time pending definitive identification and notification of next of kin. \n  \nMourning with song at scene of deadly house fire that claimed 4 girls lives pic.twitter.com/LVrDLDEhWN \n\u2014 David MacAnally (@DavidMacAnally) November 21, 2016  \n \nBurlington Asst.

It responded favorably, presenting fans acts such as American Alpha, The Revival, DIY and, of course, Shinsuke Nakamura. \n \nWhile the brand lost a great deal of talent in the brand extension, it continued to soldier on, enlisting the likes of Bobby Roode, Eric Young and Roderick Strong to help with its continued revolution of the sports-entertainment landscape. \n \nThere were still superb individual performances and five-star classics, whetting its fans' appetites for outstanding professional wrestling. \n \nAs the brand prepared to make its first mark on 2017 with TakeOver: San Antonio, it looked back at the year that was and paid tribute to the men and women who helped make it another extraordinary one for NXT with these year-end awards, revealed during Saturday's Kickoff Show. \n   NXT Tag Team of the Year  \n2 of 7 \n  \n[embedded content] \n Nominees  American Alpha  TM-61  The Authors of Pain  The Revival  DIY  \n  \n Winner  \nThe Revival \n \n  \n Analysis  \nIt may have been a temptation to choose DIY here considering their phenomenal performance in November's championship match, but in the end, fans made the only choice they could by selecting The Revival as 2016 Tag Team of the Year. \n \nScott Dawson and Dash Wilder are a throwback to tag teams of yesterday, the closest thing to a replica of the Andersons that today's audience will ever see. \n \nTheir work with American Alpha, Enzo Amore and Colin Cassady, and DIY helped solidify NXT's tag team division as the best in all of WWE. \n   Breakout Star of the Year  \n3 of 7 \n  \n[embedded content] \n Nominees  No Way Jose  Ember Moon  Andrade \"Cien\" Almas  Peyton Royce and Billie Kay  Sanity  \n  \n Winner  \nPeyton Royce and Billie Kay \n \n  \n Analysis  \nRoyce and Kay campaigned hard for this award, showing off their heelish personalities in several social media videos. \n \nTheir win here is a great sign for the devious duo, who would wrestle their biggest and most significant match to date Saturday night, an NXT Women's Championship Fatal 4-Way match with Asuka and Nikki Cross. \n \nThe lead heels in a rebuilding division, they have gotten over with an NXT audience that wants to see them get destroyed. \n \nSeeing as how that is their job in that role, it is hard to argue with their progression to this point. 2017 should be a big year for the Aussies.   \n   Female Competitor of the Year  \n4 of 7 \n  \n[embedded content] \n Nominees  Bayley  Nia Jax  Asuka  \n  \n Winner  \nAsuka \n \n  \n Analysis  \nWho can argue with Asuka's victory here given how completely dominant she was in 2016? \n \nShe beat down and sent packing the most beloved star in NXT history in Bayley. She defeated Mickie James and ruined her return to the big stage. Simply put, there was no woman remotely close to Asuka in terms of dominance. \n \nOne of the faces of the brand, Asuka was arguably the top competitor in all of NXT in 2016. \n   Male Competitor of the Year  \n5 of 7 \n  \n[embedded content] \n Nominees  Finn Balor  Samoa Joe  Shinsuke Nakamura  Bobby Roode  \n  \n Winner  \nShinsuke Nakamura \n \n  \n Analysis  \nThere was an argument to be made for Samoa Joe, but Shinsuke Nakamura ran away with this one on the strength of his first nine months with NXT. \n \nA five-star classic against Sami Zayn, a hard-hitting match with Finn Balor, a strong series with Joe and two NXT Championship wins comprise a resume second to none in a year of rebuild and transition for the brand. \n \nNakamura became the face of the hottest brand in sports entertainment, and the result was an experience fans had never witnessed before in the revolutionary brand. \n   NXT Superstar of the Year  \n6 of 7 \n  \n[embedded content] \n Nominees  Bobby Roode  Asuka  Nia Jax  Shinsuke Nakamura  Finn Balor  Bayley  Samoa Joe  \n  \n Winner   \nShinsuke Nakamura \n \n  \n Analysis  \nThe NXT champion made it two-for-two Saturday nigh, capturing the biggest award of the night, Superstar of the Year. \n \nFrom the moment he set foot through the curtain at TakeOver: Dallas for what would be a classic encounter with Sami Zayn, it was clear that NXT had been graced by a competitor the likes of which it had never seen before. \n \nNot only was he The King of Strong Style, he brought with him a charisma that captivated fans and earned him main event status right out of the gate. He beat every major star the brand had to offer and now enters 2017 ready to continue his success as the focal point of NXT booking. \n   NXT Match of the Year  \n7 of 7 \n  \n[embedded content] \n Nominees  Finn Balor vs. Shinsuke Nakamura (NXT TV, July 13)  Asuka vs. Mickie James (TakeOver: Toronto)  American Alpha vs. The Revival (TakeOver: The End of the Beginning)  Sami Zayn vs. Shinsuke Nakamura (TakeOver: Dallas)  Bayley vs. Asuka (TakeOver: Dallas)  Sami Zayn vs. Samoa Joe (NXT TV, February 13)  Finn Balor vs. Samoa Joe (TakeOver: The End of the Beginning)  DIY vs. The Revival (TakeOver: Toronto)  Neville vs. Finn Balor (NXT TV, March 2)  Shinsuke Nakamura vs. Samoa Joe (TakeOver: Toronto)  American Alpha vs. The Revival (NXT TV, July 6)  \n  \n Winner  \nDIY vs. The Revival (TakeOver: Toronto) \n \n  \n Analysis  \nIn a year that touted as emotional and extraordinary a match as Sami Zayn vs. Shinsuke Nakamura from TakeOver: Dallas, the fact that DIY vs. The Revival from Toronto won Match of the Year is a testament to the bit of tag team magic those duos delivered. \n \nBuilding on spots established in their previous encounters, they had the audience in Canada eating out of their hands, eager to see which team would emerge with the titles around their waists. \n \nAt the least, the match restored faith in tag team wrestling. At most, it reminded fans why they love the art of wrestling and just how magical it can be when done at a virtuoso level.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Erik Beaston"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"WWE NXT Year-End Awards: Winners, Analysis and Reaction","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bleacher Report UK","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"433282699","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"24889"},"name":"Bleacher Report UK","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://bleacherreport.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196911500","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T03:02:06Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I'm not going to stir the hornet's nest, but a number of other teams have had the opportunity to control where they've played this year.\" \n \nAnother sticking point is training. \n \nUnited can train throughout the week at McKellar for minimal cost, but would get limited access to Canberra Stadium. \n \nLast time the Mariners were in town, Canberra played its season opener against Melbourne City as part of a Canberra Stadium double-header, losing that game 2-1. \n \nThey were unable to train on the ground in the lead-up to that match. \n \nUnited co-captain Ellie Brush reiterated Dower's preference, but added they'd be ready regardless of where the game was. \n \n\"This is our favoured home, but ... we don't really mind where we suit up, we know the crowd will get out and support us. Just two more [wins] to go,\" she said. \n \nDower said Brush's fellow co-captain Michelle Heyman was unlikely to be ready for the semi, although she had returned to training with the main group as she continued her comeback from toe and ankle injuries. \n \nThe Matildas striker has been out since she rolled her ankle against the Melbourne Victory at the end of December. \n \n\"She was back training [Friday], which was a great sight to see her out here at McKellar juggling, jogging laps, kicking the ball around,\" Dower said. \n \n\"It was really great. Next week might be asking too much, but at least she's back in the frame now and she's running herself around.\" \n \nW-LEAGUE SEMI-FINAL \n \nCanberra United v Melbourne City \n \nA-LEAGUE ROUND 18 \n \nSunday: Central Coast Mariners v Adelaide United at Canberra Stadium, 5pm.

Arrogate won the richest race ever run by 4 3/4 lengths over Shaman Ghost, and the only reason it was that close is because Smith took his foot off the gas long before the wire. \n \nHe was dominant. \n \nCalifornia Chrome was dominated, finishing ninth and beaten by 29 1/2 lengths. \n \n\u201cChrome just didn\u2019t fire his race today at all,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBelieve me, that\u2019s not the California Chrome I know.\u201d \n \nThat surely didn\u2019t matter to Arrogate\u2019s connections, after the horse won his sixth straight race \u2014 the last three of those being of the Grade 1 variety, with the Travers followed by the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic and now the Pegasus. He came in with lifetime earnings of $4,084,600, and added $7 million to that by finishing 1 1/8 miles in 1:47.61. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s great to be here,\u201d said Bob Baffert, Arrogate\u2019s trainer who held back some emotions afterward. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be here in a $12 million race.\u201d \n \nArrogate edged California Chrome in the Breeders\u2019 Cup last fall, and the two were stride-for-stride in much of the early going Saturday. It looked like it may shape up as the match race that many envisioned, with the two stars dueling to the end. \n \nThat never happened. California Chrome was laboring, and when Smith got Arrogate to the front it was over. \n \nThe 2014 and 2016 Horse of the Year would have been the first thoroughbred in history to earn over $20 million had he prevailed. It was the first time California Chrome was lower than third in his last 13 starts, and he never was worse than sixth in any of his previous 26 starts. \n \n\u201cHe didn\u2019t look real comfortable,\u201d California Chrome trainer Art Sherman said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t break as sharp as he usually does and then he got hung out so wide. But down the backside he had no excuse. ... He looked like he was listless. I don\u2019t know why. This is the first bad race he\u2019s ever run for me.\u201d \n \nArrogate, meanwhile, keeps getting better. \n \n\u201cWhat a superior horse he is,\u201d Baffert said. \n \nArrogate returned $3.80 to his win bettors. Shaman Ghost was second and picked up $1.75 million, and Neolithic was third for $1 million in purse money. \n \nCalifornia Chrome is headed to start his stud career in Kentucky in the next few days. By the time Arrogate got to the winner\u2019s circle, Chrome was already headed back to the barn. \n \n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough gas in there,\u201d California Chrome jockey Victor Espinoza said. \u201cHe was empty. I hope he\u2019s OK.\u201d \n \nIt was a day unlike any other at Gulfstream \u2014 and in racing, for that matter. \n \nThe track is ordinarily wide open and with free admission, but patrons Saturday had to go through tight security and pay at least $100 per ticket just to get inside. Celebrities walked the red carpet, expensive cars were lined up in the valet parking areas and some fans stood for hours around temporary fences just to get a look at horses in the walking ring. \n \n\u201cIt was hopping,\u201d Baffert said. \n \nIt was an event, like organizers hoped. And not only did a big crowd show up, they brought cash \u2014 Gulfstream\u2019s handle for the day was $40.2 million, $8 million more than last year\u2019s Florida Derby brought to the track. \n \n\u201cThis thing worked,\u201d said Prayer for Relief trainer Dale Romans, whose horse was 10th in the 12-entry field. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most enjoyable days I\u2019ve ever participated in horse racing.\u201d \n \nSmith and Baffert would say the same. \n \n\u201cAs far as winning the world\u2019s richest race,\u201d Smith said, \u201cI\u2019m absolutely numb.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: horse racing news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Arrogate wins Pegasus; Chrome runs ninth","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Suffolk","zipCode":"11747","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Melville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Newsday","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660717","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6318"},"name":"Newsday","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsday.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196915603","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A community group is appealing for volunteers to train as millers in Yorkshire's oldest working windmill. The Holgate Windmill Preservation Society is looking to increase its group of around 30 active members to help with milling flour for customers in the York area. The five-sailed windmill in York was reopened in 2012 after a £500,000 refurbishment, which saw the 18th century, Grade II-listed building restored to working order.\n\nThe mill currently has three trained millers who work one day a week to produce 50kg of flour, which is sold to local restaurants, farm shops and individual customers, with proceeds used for the upkeep of the mill. Steve Potts, chairman of the society and one of the trained millers, said he believes they could produce 10 times the amount of flour with extra millers and an extra day of milling each week.\n\nHe said anyone interested in learning the skills of one of the oldest professions in the world could be trained in a couple of months. Mr Potts said: \"It's not a reading skill, it's a doing and learning by experience skill. We used some of our grant money for a miller to come along and give us on-the-job training.\n\n\"Part of it is to come along so we can pass on our skills. It's about keeping the skills alive.\" He added: \"We can do 50kg of flour per week but we could do 10 times that if we had the manpower.\n\n\"We started off reasonably gradually because we're a volunteer group and it's supposed to be fun but we are trying to make more money out of the milling.\" Volunteers would learn how to work the mill's sails and motors and how to process the flour.\n\nMr Potts said: \"It's quite skilled, there's an element of responsibility.

I'm not going to stir the hornet's nest, but a number of other teams have had the opportunity to control where they've played this year.\" \n \nAnother sticking point is training. \n \nUnited can train throughout the week at McKellar for minimal cost, but would get limited access to Canberra Stadium. \n \nLast time the Mariners were in town, Canberra played its season opener against Melbourne City as part of a Canberra Stadium double-header, losing that game 2-1. \n \nThey were unable to train on the ground in the lead-up to that match. \n \nUnited co-captain Ellie Brush reiterated Dower's preference, but added they'd be ready regardless of where the game was. \n \n\"This is our favoured home, but ... we don't really mind where we suit up, we know the crowd will get out and support us. Just two more [wins] to go,\" she said. \n \nDower said Brush's fellow co-captain Michelle Heyman was unlikely to be ready for the semi, although she had returned to training with the main group as she continued her comeback from toe and ankle injuries. \n \nThe Matildas striker has been out since she rolled her ankle against the Melbourne Victory at the end of December. \n \n\"She was back training [Friday], which was a great sight to see her out here at McKellar juggling, jogging laps, kicking the ball around,\" Dower said. \n \n\"It was really great.

Paper manufacturing began in 1914 with up to 250 men employed by the mill. As a result Sheldon Springs became known as a \u201ccompany town.\u201d (Photo: Courtesy Harold Smith/Sheldon Historical Society) \n  \nSHELDON SPRINGS - First settled by Smith Olmstead and known as \u201cOlmsted Falls,\u201d Sheldon Springs came into existence in the late 1700s. \n \nOlmstead was a farmer and the owner of a grist mill at the falls. The Missisquoi River at the north end of the village provided the impetus for the settlement with its source of power. Major Smith built the first sawmill here in 1792 capable of cutting 15,000 feet of lumber a day. \n \nGeorge Bancroft owned the Lime Kiln and quarry and manufactured lumber, shingles and lathes. Included within the community were one store, a Missisquoi Railroad station, and Congress Hall. A schoolhouse was erected before 1800. The first postmaster in Sheldon Spring was William Adams appointed on June 26, 1871. \n \nMineral water for Champlain \n \nAs early as 1609 the mineral water that would transform Olmstead Falls into Sheldon Springs was procured by Samuel D. Champlain when natives took skins of water to his ship to aid his wounded and ailing sailors. \n \nBetween 1865 and 1870 Sheldon became the leading water resort of the United States. Six identified mineral springs resulted in the construction of 11 hotels in the Sheldon. \n \nCongress Hall, built in 1868 occupied a prominent place at the intersection of Main Street and Shawville Road in Sheldon Springs. The 123 feet by 96 feet four story structure opened to tourists in 1869. Water was drawn from \u201cKimball Springs.\u201d \n \nIncluded were two bath houses and a large bottling plant. Following the \u201cBoom Years\u201d the hotel was rarely used but the Catholic Church used the dining room for weekly worship. On Dec. 19, 1908, the building burned to the ground at the hands of a disgruntled employee. The land was subsequently deed to the church. St. Anthony\u2019s Church now stands on that corner. \n  \nHistoric photo of Congress Hall in Sheldon Springs.

Paper manufacturing began in 1914 with up to 250 men employed by the mill. As a result Sheldon Springs became known as a \u201ccompany town\u201d with the company owning the store and some of the community buildings and providing water and electricity to the town. \n  \nRail yard near the pulp mill in Sheldon Springs.  (Photo: Courtesy Harold Smith/Sheldon Historical Society) \n   \nMany of the current structures on what is now Mill Street changed from Main Street by the \u201cMill\u201d are nearly identical buildings constructed by the mill for workers. The center hub of Sheldon Springs at Mill Street and Shawville Road included houses and garages for the managers of the mill. \n \nThe mill further developed the town by building employee houses along with is now called School Street, Boarding House Road, and High Street. Many of those structures continued to be occupied today. The mill sold most of its housing units to private citizens in the 1970s. \n \nThe original \u201clow dam\u201d was replaced by a \u201chigh dam\u201d at the head of a deep canyon providing energy originally for powering the mill equipment but converted to a source of hydroelectric power later. Without a doubt the \u201cMill\u201d shaped the community from the early 1900s on. \n  \nSheldon Springs railroad crossing and company store.  (Photo: Courtesy Harold Smith/Sheldon Historical Society) \n    \nRailroad came in 1871 \n  \nThe Missisquoi Railroad also helped shape the town. The first run from St. Albans through Sheldon Springs occurred on July 4, 1871. The Missisquoi Valley Railroad sold out to the Central Vermont Railroad and ceased to be a significant or profitable line. \n \nFollowing the abandonment of the line, the citizens sought and secured the rail bed and transformed it into the 18-mile long Missisquoi Rail Trail for recreational purposes. \n \nSince the 1970s many of the mill houses, the store, the old school, and other buildings fell to the wrecking ball of innovation and progress. The fire department now occupies the old store location and several of the houses along Boarding House Road were relocated. \n \nSheldon Springs persists as a largely residential village with the exception of the \u201cMill,\u201d which continues in operation. Route 105 cuts through the village with residents scattered along Mill Street, Boarding House Road, High Street and School Street. \n \nIn order to visit you will need to depart from the main highway or better yet take the rail trail. \n \nRead or Share this story: http://bfpne.ws/2jDuits","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HAROLD SMITH, For the Free Press"},"topics":[],"title":"History Space: River power shaped Sheldon Springs","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Chittenden","zipCode":"05402","state":"Vermont","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Burlington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Burlington Press","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664211","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3143"},"name":"Burlington Press","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com","publisher":"Gannett"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bfpne.ws/2jDuits"],"sequenceId":"695196921063","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:40:02Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official.

The fight featured moments of heavy exchanges, which resulted in the reopening of a former cut above one of Vargas's eyes during the ninth round. \n  \n\"I wanted to fight the best of the best, and this fight happened because of that,\" said Miguel \"El Alacran\" Berchelt. \"Francisco is a great champion, he has fought the best and has been in two Fight of the Year contests. I knew what I was getting into; he has great heart. I left my heart and soul on the mat. I am young and hungry, and I want to fight the best because that is how champions are made. I want to thank Vargas for this incredible opportunity.\" \n  \n\"I want to wish Berchelt all the best. It was a tough fight, and he's young with a lot of heart and passion and hunger. He cut me, and I just wasn't able to see because the blood kept coming into my eyes. I am not the type of fighter to give in, and I will always be fighting. I am a warrior, and I will be that to the very end. I probably would have kept going if they wouldn't have stopped the fight.

Coria attained his knock out at the 2:52 mark during the first round. \n  \n\"This was a big night for me because it was my first time on an HBO card,\" said Luis Coria. \"It was also huge because Lupillo Rivera walked with me, and that was humbling because he is this huge star.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official.

The live band he put together behind the album featured bassist Pino Palladino, known for his collaboration with the soul singer D'Angelo, and one of Whitney Houston's backup vocalists. \n \nBut \"Not the Actual Events\" opens with \"Branches/Bones,\" a brief blast of fuzzed-out guitars overlaid with sinister words about \"spiders crawling everywhere\" and \"pieces with the opening sewed shut.\" In \"Burning Bright (Field on Fire),\" the guitars get bigger and more serrated, ultimately cresting in a wave that drowns out Reznor's voice. \n \n\"I'm going back/ Of course I am,\" he sings. \"As if I ever had a choice/ Back to what I always knew I was.\" \n \nThe music is still carefully constructed. Reznor recorded \"Not the Actual Events\" with Atticus Ross, his partner in the high-profile film-score work he started doing during one of Nine Inch Nail's breaks. Together they won an Oscar in 2011 for \"The Social Network\" and went on to score other movies, including this month's \"Patriots Day.\" \n \nThe two also play in How to Destroy Angels, another on-again/off-again outfit they share with Reznor's wife, singer Mariqueen Maandig. \n \nHere you can sense their attention to detail in \"Dear World,\" with a machine-tooled drum track that keeps shifting to emphasize unexpected beats, and \"She's Gone Away,\" which features Maandig singing in ghostly harmony with Rez-nor, her voice nearly imperceptible in the mix. \n \nIt's there too in the EP's exacting artwork - a true sign of aesthetic commitment, given how few listeners even see packaging in the age of digital streaming. \n \nYet the EP's impact is blunt, as the band itself was quick to proclaim in a statement announcing its release. \"It's an unfriendly, fairly impenetrable record that we needed to make,\" Reznor said. \n \nFor \"The Idea of You,\" Reznor recruited Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters (who handled drums on Nine Inch Nails' 2005 album, \"With Teeth\"), and his muscular playing gives the song a punky intensity as the singer seems to shake off a vivid nightmare: \"None of this is happening.\" (Another guest, Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction, appears on \"Burning Bright.\") \n \nWhy the reunion with noise and fury? It might be Reznor's way of waking up a society in which \"everyone seems to be asleep,\" as he sings in \"Dear World.\" \n \nOr perhaps working in Hollywood just built up steam he needs to blow off. \"Oh, my God, I have missed you,\" he sings in \"Burning Bright\" with the frazzled emotion of a man who's sat through too many meetings with too many executives. \"It has been so long.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Mikael Wood"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Trent Reznor's old noise and fury is back","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Berks","zipCode":"19601","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Reading","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Reading Eagle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169721556","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1255"},"name":"Reading Eagle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.readingeagle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196926266","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Not only that, but as jazz cats like to say, it swings. \n \n\"People will come up to me at a show and go, 'Don't take this the wrong way: I don't like jazz, but I like what you guys do,' \" Wahrhaftig said, \"and I just go, 'Thanks.' They might think that's a left-handed compliment, but we don't take it that way.\" \n \nLike most of his contemporaries growing up in the 1960s, Wahrhaftig admired rock 'n' roll icons - Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones and the Beatles - but as an adult he gravitated toward straight-ahead jazz guitarists like Wes Montgomery and Pat Metheny. Then, around 2001, he started really delving into the music of Reinhardt one day while poking around online. \n \nHe found a Yahoo Newsgroup - this was pre-Facebook - composed of what he called \"Reinhardt nerds\" and started jamming with some of them. Finally, attending a concert by French guitarist and violinist Dorado Schmitt and his band at Lincoln Center put him over the top. \n \n\"I've got to tell you,\" Wahrhaftig said, \"I've heard jazz all my life, I've written reviews, on and on, and I was stunned at what they did. They played like it was their last day on Earth, you know? I had to process it: Wow, what is this?\" \n \nHe was inspired to put together a Hot Club of his own, and his group has been playing greater Philadelphia venues ever since, and also has a strong following in the Lehigh Valley. \n \nFor their first visit to Landhaven, Wahrhaftig will be joined by his full band, and what a lineup it is: Phyllis Chapell on vocals, Dan Pearce on rhythm guitar, Joseph Arnold on violin and Jim Stager on upright bass. \n \nWahrhaftig said he learned about Landhaven from John Jorgenson, the virtuosic multi-instrumentalist who has played there numerous times. The two have shared stages on several occasions, and Jorgenson wrote the liner notes for Hot Club's 2011 debut CD, \"Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams.\" \n \n\"He had told us years ago, 'you guys should play there,' \" Wahrhaftig said. \n \nThe venue qualifies as an ideal setting to hear gypsy jazz. Jorgenson himself is said to have likened the acoustics of the general store-turned-listening room to playing on the inside of a guitar. \n \nHot Club's repertoire actually goes beyond gypsy jazz all the way back to 1920s hits like Nat King Cole's \"Sweet Lorraine\" and forward to Frank Sinatra standards, Jay Ungar's folk classic \"Ashokan Farewell\" and even a Beatles number here or there if the mood strikes. \n \nFor Wahrhaftig, it boils down to entertaining the audience. \n \n\"I like to work the crowd,\" he said. \" I'll put it this way: I'm an entertainer. I happen to be playing mostly gypsy jazz for the past 16 years, and I love it, but I always want to work the room.\" \n \nContact Don Botch: 610-371-5055 or dbotch@readingeagle.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ByDon Botch"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Hot Club of Philadelphia set to swing into Landhaven","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Berks","zipCode":"19601","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Reading","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Reading Eagle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169721556","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1255"},"name":"Reading Eagle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.readingeagle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196926450","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And a piano prize-winner\u2019s UK debut A long, frozen winter, the surprise of spring renewal, bird song and folk melody: Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s The Snow Maiden (1882) pulls us deep into the poetic world of Russian folklore and the story of the ice girl who will melt if exposed to the sun. Only with her death can winter end. That sudden moment when white turns to water and spring bursts has long obsessed Russian artists \u2013 novelists, playwrights, landscape painters, but no one more potently than Stravinsky in his ballet The Rite of Spring. Rimsky\u2019s opera, gentle in comparison but not without its raw moments, opened Opera North\u2019s 2017 season of fairytale operas. A mentor to so many of his fellow Russian composers, Rimsky was at his most brilliant in the kitchen of orchestration John Fulljames\u2019s new staging is described as the first \"full professional production\" in this country for 60 years. In Russia it remains mainstream. Numerous versions exist of the archetypal tale, its origins probably Slavic. Arthur Ransome introduced the icicle maid in his Old Peter\u2019s Russian Tales. Rimsky-Korsakov based his libretto on Alexander Ostrovsky\u2019s play, a more elaborate and adult affair spurned by the literary world. Tolstoy, usually a fan, found it dull. You can see why, but it makes an ideal foil for music. A mentor to so many of his fellow Russian composers, Rimsky was at his most brilliant in the kitchen of orchestration. The solo woodwind, clarinet especially, and the vivid splash of Russian, eastern and western styles makes The Snow Maiden instantly enchanting. Using the if-you-like-this ploy, usually quite unreliable, anyone should feel confident to try this rarity by the composer of that popular symphonic suite, Scheherazade. Fascinating, too, is the way this music points towards the 20th century. Stravinsky was Rimsky\u2019s student; the younger composer\u2019s Funeral Song, found recently and performed last month in St Petersburg, was dedicated to Rimsky\u2019s memory. The quirky marches of Shostakovich and Prokofiev are there too, incipient in their irony. The Snow Maiden: reinventing a Russian folk opera for modern Britain Read more Yet The Snow Maiden is an odd, lopsided work in Rimsky\u2019s fluent telling. The first half concentrates on customary folk-fairy elements \u2013 lost girl, benign ruler, ritual pricking, pinching and beating of one dubious character. The remaining two acts expand into a more affecting human love story, with ambitious, lyrical music and memorable arias and choruses, enthusiastically delivered by the forces of Opera North conducted by Leo McFall in his company debut. Some of the jigsaw refused to fit together. Giles Cadle\u2019s sets, with costumes by Christina Cunningham and video designs by Will Duke, looked attractive in a busy, brightly coloured picture-book way.\n\nNo distinction is made between traditional and contemporary. Lel, the trouser-role love interest engagingly portrayed by Heather Lowe, carries a smartphone. The village women work in a sewing sweatshop straight out of The Pajama Game, producing clothes for all seasons, from jeans to bridal gowns, which bob by on a pulley behind them. Spring Beauty, touchingly sung by Yvonne Howard, wore a traditional sun headdress and green cloak, while Father Frost \u2013 the Snow Maiden was a product of their careless liaison \u2013 was robustly delivered by a silver-coated James Creswell. The crystal-voiced Aoife Miskelly was a canny choice for the title role, with Elin Pritchard generous and winningly blowsy as the vodka-steeped Kupava. Heather Lowe as Lel and Elin Pritchard as Kupava. Photograph: Richard Hubert Smith It\u2019s hard to pinpoint what was missing. Perhaps the restraints of the slim story were too sorely exposed when sung in an artful English translation by Alasdair Middleton. Opera North\u2019s flexibility in performing some works in English, some in the original language as they see best, is admirable. Here, though, you needed the rich sounds of Russian, as integral to Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s palette as the hearty choruses of boyars and village peasants. Ensemble was not always good, and some of the cast suffered intonation problems \u2013 all of which could be attributed to first-night nerves. The production tried too hard, resulting in a confusion between stylisation and naturalism. Next on the fairytale front: Humperdinck\u2019s Hansel and Gretel (Susan Bullock\u2019s Witch is sure to be one of the unmissable performances of the season) and Rossini\u2019s La Cenerentola. \u2018Meticulous\u2019: Luca Burrato at Wigmore Hall. Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer Whatever you think about piano competitions, if you think about them at all \u2013 with so many around, the instinct to ignore them is understandable \u2013 some stand out as important. The Honens, taking place every three years in Calgary, Canada, is one. The 24-year-old Italian Luca Buratto, the 2015 prize laureate, attracted a crowd of serious pianists and pianophiles to Wigmore Hall for his UK debut last week. One appeal was the interesting programme, which ranged from a John Dowland pavan (arranged by William Byrd) to Thomas Adès\u2019s Darknesse visible, to Beethoven\u2019s Appassionata and Schumann\u2019s majestic Fantasie. Graceful, analytical, meticulous, Buratto is a name to watch. His playing is economical of gesture and outward expression. Next time perhaps he will allow himself a flicker of smile when he takes his bow. Without compromising his integrity and reserve, he now needs to let rip. Then the results should be not just formidable but hotly compelling.\n\nStar ratings (out of 5)\n\nThe Snow Maiden ★★★\n\nLuca Buratto ★★★★\n\nThe Snow Maiden is in rep at the Grand theatre, Leeds

New research methods and technologies are able to shed light on climate patterns that took place thousands of years ago, giving us a new perspective on how cultures of the time coped with variable and changing environments. A new article in the February issue of Current Anthropology explores the dynamics of adaptation and resilience in the face of a diverse and varied environmental context, using the case study of South Asia\u2019s Indus Civilization (c.3000-1300 BC). Integrating research carried out as part of the Land, Water and Settlement project \u2014 part of an ongoing collaboration between the University of Cambridge and Banaras Hindu University \u2014 that worked in northwest India between 2007 and 2014, the article looks at how Indus populations in north-west India interacted with their environment, and considers how that environment changed during periods of climate change.

Mohenjo-daro, on the right bank of the Indus River, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the first site in South Asia to be so declared. Credit: Wikimedia Commons Lead author, Dr. Cameron Petrie of the Division of Archaeology, University of Cambridge notes that \u201cfor most ancient complex societies, water was a critical factor, and the availability of water and the way that it was managed and used provide critical insight into human adaptation and the resilience of subsistence practices\u201d. Most early complex societies developed in regions where the climatic parameters faced by ancient subsistence farmers were varied, but not especially diverse. The Indus Civilization developed in a specific environmental context, where the winter and summer rainfall systems overlapped. There is now evidence to show that this region was subject to climate change during the period when the Indus Civilization was at its height (c.2500-1900 BC). The Indus Civilization therefore provides a unique opportunity to understand how an ancient society coped with diverse and varied ecologies and change in the fundamental and underlying environmental parameters. Credit: Wikimedia Commons In the early Holocene, the Indus Civilization was situated in proximity to Kotla Dahar, a deep lake, implying regular and consistent rainfall input to offset evaporation, which given its location, would have been primarily monsoonal. The lake showed evidence for two dramatic decreases in monsoon rainfall and a progressive lowering of the lake level. The second of these shows Kotla Dahar becoming completely ephemeral ca. 2200-2000 BC as a result of an abrupt weakening of the monsoon, and the weakening of the monsoon is visible in speleothem records in Oman and northeast India. The proximity of the Kotla Dahar record to the area occupied by Indus populations shows that climate must be formally considered as a contributing parameter in the process of Indus deurbanization, at least in the context of the plains of northwest India. It has long been hypothesized that there was variation in the subsistence practices used by Indus populations and this fits with the theme of coping with diverse environments. Petrie comments that \u201cwe argue that rather than being forced to intensify or diversify subsistence practices in response to climatic change, we have evidence for the use of millet, rice, and tropical pulses in the pre-urban and urban phases of the Indus Civilization. This evidence suggests that local Indus populations were already well adapted to living in varied and variable environmental conditions before the development of urban centers. It is also possible that these adaptations were beneficial when these populations were faced with changes to the local environment that were probably beyond the range of variation that they typically encountered\u201d.

When inflammation was high in one, it was low in the other,\" said co-author Randy Nelson, also a professor of neuroscience at Ohio State's Wexner Medical Center. \n\nThe study was published today in the journal Scientific Reports. \n\nThese results mark another step in how scientists understand cancer chronotherapy\u2014using the body's daily circadian rhythms to time treatments so they are most effective and have the fewest side effects. \n\n\"I think we know enough about circadian rhythms in terms of physiology that we can start translating these findings into medical research and practice in humans,\" Nelson said. \n\nThe research team studied the drugs cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, a common treatment for breast cancer, in female mice. The mice did not have tumors because this study was designed just to look at the inflammatory response to the drugs. \n\nThe mice were injected with the drugs two hours after daylight (which is their inactive period) or two hours after lights were turned off (their active period). \n\nResearchers collected tissue and checked for signs of inflammation in the spleen, an important immune system organ. The also looked at two sites in the brain: the hypothalamus and the hippocampus. Tissue was collected at 1, 3, 9 or 24 hours after the injection. \n\nResults showed that injecting mice with the chemotherapy drugs in their inactive phase (daylight) increased the expression of genes that promoted inflammation within the spleen. The researchers found increased production of two toxic drug metabolites, products of the chemo drugs. These metabolites are related to inflammation and one of them, doxorubicinol, causes heart damage in some patients. \n\n\"The timing of when patients receive drugs has the potential to reduce serious side effects,\" DeVries said. \n\nThe effect was different for mice that received the drugs two hours after the lights were out. In these mice, inflammation measured in the spleen was much lower than the mice injected during the day. \n\nThe pattern was reversed in the brain, however. Mice injected at night had increases in pro-inflammatory gene expression, but showed less evidence of inflammation when injected during the day. \n\nThe difference in inflammation response between the brain and the rest of the body needs to be better appreciated by physicians, Nelson said. \n\n\"Many times physicians measure markers of inflammation in the blood and assume that is what is happening in the brain, but we found that just the opposite is happening,\" he said. \n\nWhy is there a difference between how the brain and spleen are reacting to these chemotherapy drugs? \n\nOther research has shown that the clock genes in the brain are out of sync with those in other organs. Expression of these clock genes may affect how the drugs are processed, or metabolized, in the body, Nelson said. \n\nThese findings can't tell us the best time to administer chemotherapy drugs in humans, DeVries said of the new study. \n\n\"But it does demonstrate that time of day is an important factor that needs to be considered in when the drugs are given,\" she said. \n\nNelson noted that this study only looked at administering drugs at two time points. \n\n\"There may be a sweet spot that maximizes the efficacy of the drugs and minimizes the side effects.

During the 2016 filing season, the IRS reported a 400 percent increase in tax-related scams. \n \nThe IRS continues to update its warnings to taxpayers about an ongoing telephone scam in which the caller claims to be an IRS agent tasked with collecting an unpaid tax liability. The caller demands immediate payment by gift card or iTunes card, both of which are more difficult to trace, and often threatens arrest if the taxpayer fails to comply. I have spoken to several taxpayers who received these calls, and have received them myself. I have also seen fake IRS messages come through via text making similar claims and enticing taxpayers to call a phone number provided to settle the matter. To avoid falling victim to these telephone and text message scams, keep in mind that the IRS will never contact you by phone or text regarding your tax account or filings. They will always send a notice through the old-fashioned U.S. mail. \n \nScammers have also used email to find victims and this approach may be growing. The IRS recently warned tax preparers regarding a two-part email scam comprised of an initial message supposedly from a taxpayer looking for assistance in preparing his tax return. If the preparer responds, a second email with either a web link or a PDF attachment with an embedded web link is sent under the guise of containing the taxpayer's tax documents. These links are designed to allow the scammer to collect information from the tax preparer that can be used to unlock other information the scammers can use for financial gain. \n \nAnother email scam targeting tax preparers is also circulating. In an effort to improve its e-services system, which is used by tax professionals to request tax transcripts and conduct other business with the IRS on a taxpayer's behalf, the IRS recently required all e-services users verify their identities. Notices were mailed to all e-services users that their accounts would be disabled if they did not take action within 30 days. Scammers have used this opportunity to send fraudulent emails which appear to be an important security-related communication from the IRS but actually contain a link to a bogus website that mimics the IRS' e-services registration page. \n \nBased on a message I received from a client last week, this scam may be targeting taxpayers as well. She had received an email that appeared to be from the IRS requesting that she verify her account information via a web link. This email was not legitimate. The IRS has a clear warning on its \"Get Transcript\" web page noting the IRS will never call, email or text a taxpayer asking for information or requesting that a taxpayer login to a website to update his or her account profile.  \n \nThe IRS also issued a warning about emails containing fake CP2000 notices. These notices are generated when information reported on a taxpayer's return does not match information the IRS received on W-2, 1099 and other tax-related reports. If additional tax is owed due to the discrepancy on the return, these notices also provide instructions for making a payment to the IRS. In addition to appearing legitimate, the fake notices are being sent both via email and postal mail. Emailed versions should be easy to identify as fake since the IRS will never use email to deliver them. \n \nThe IRS has also provided guidance regarding how to tell if a CP2000 notice is legitimate or a scam. The fake notices are issued from an Austin, Texas, address and the tax issue involved is related to the Affordable Care Act. The included payment voucher in the fake versions also lists a letter number 105C. To help taxpayers determine whether a notice received via mail is legitimate, the IRS recommends visiting their website at www.irs.gov/individuals/understanding-your-cp2000-notice where they provide an example of a real notice. \n \nDavid T.

Under the £75,000 limit, around 97% of people were protected. \n \nThe compensation limit is applied per banking authorisation - and some banking brands share an authorisation. \n \nThis means some savers may want to split their deposits out more widely among different firms, to prevent the total value of deposits they hold with a single firm going over the deposit protection limit.  \n \nSavers can check whether their cash is fully protected by going to fscs.org.uk/protected.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Increase in deposit protection limit means extra security for savers' cash","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"AOL UK","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662251","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"AOL UK","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.aol.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196948700","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It also marks a reversal from the 2013 triumph that gave him his current job, when as CEO of US Airways he relied on support from those same labor groups to engineer a merger with American.\n\n\u201cThe honeymoon is over,\u201d said Michael Schwarz, a captain at American. \u201cThey had the opportunity and they don\u2019t seem to be doing anything to really effect the change they said they were going to do. It was a great opportunity for us to be the largest and be the best. Right now, we\u2019re just the largest.\u201d\n\nA transformed culture at the carrier would have enormous value, according to Parker. He cites Southwest Airlines Co. co-founder Herb Kelleher\u2019s message that happy employees take care of customers and happy passengers take care of shareholders by choosing to fly on the airline again. Delta already has this advantage, and new CEO Oscar Munoz is gaining it at United, Parker says.\n\n\u201cI wish we were further along, but we\u2019re also realistic about what we\u2019re trying to do here,\u201d Parker said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous effort at a really big airline with a history so different than what we\u2019re trying to build.\u201d\n\nParker, 55, inherited a legacy of corrosive labor-management relations. In 2003, workers agreed to $1.8 billion in concessions to save the carrier from bankruptcy. At the same time, it was revealed that top executives had received bonuses and pension protection. After the company filed for Chapter 11 in 2011, unions accepted a second round of givebacks. Parker acknowledges that workers still don\u2019t trust managers.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Mary Schlangenstein"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Mistrust haunts American","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Marion","zipCode":"46204","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indianapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Journal-Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657677","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1517"},"name":"Journal-Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.journalgazette.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196951533","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T20:10:22Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://journalgazette.net/assets/13604957/17497099.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Wright, 26, attended Ivy Tech until last year, studying software development, but is now at Indiana Tech majoring in web development and working in the tech field.\n\nThe idea for the club to sponsor lectures came from Lucy La Hurreau, Wright said.

She earned a degree in computer networking and in business, then went to Indiana Tech, where she received a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration focusing on information management. She is an assistant professor with Ivy Tech\u2019s health information technology program.\n\nAbout 75 percent of college students are women or minority, La Hurreau said, but less than 20 percent of those are going into the tech field.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not taught the fact that that is something we can do,\u201d she said. \n\nThe goal behind ongoing dialogue about diversity is to say \u201cthere\u2019s a spot for you here.

Lenders have gotten choosier about which buildings they\u2019ll fund, concerned about overheated prices for hotels and shopping malls and record values for office buildings in cities such as New York. Rising interest rates and regulatory constraints for banks also are increasing the odds that borrowers will come up short when it\u2019s time to refinance.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot more problem loans out there than people think,\u201d said Ray Potter, founder of R3 Funding, a New York firm that arranges financing for landlords and investors. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to see a huge crash, but there will be more losses than people are expecting.\u201d\n\nThe winners and losers of a lopsided real estate recovery will be cemented as the last vestiges of pre-crisis debt clear the system. While Manhattan skyscraper values have surged 50 percent above the 2008 peak, prices for suburban office buildings still languish 4.8 percent below, according to an index from Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Real Capital Analytics Inc.\n\nBorrowers holding commercial real estate outside major metropolitan areas are now feeling the pinch as they attempt to secure fresh financing, Potter said.\n\nThe delinquency rate for commercial mortgages that have been packaged into bonds is forecast to climb by as much as 2.4 percentage points to 5.75 percent in 2017, reversing several years of declines, as property owners struggle with maturing loans, according to Fitch Ratings. That sets the stage for bondholder losses.\n\nBanks sold a record $250 billion of commercial mortgage-backed securities to institutional investors in 2007, and lax lending standards enabled landlords across the U.S. to saddle buildings with large piles of debt. When credit markets froze the following year, Wall Street analysts warned of a cataclysm, with $700 billion of commercial mortgages set to mature over the next decade.\n\n\u201cAt the depths of the panic, it was just that: Panic,\u201d said Manus Clancy, a managing director at Trepp LLC, a firm that tracks commercial-mortgage debt. \u201cThat made people\u2019s future expectations extremely bearish. Extremely low interest rates over the last four or five years have forgiven a lot of sins.\u201d\n\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities market roared back after a 16-month shutdown, and lenders plowed into real estate as an antidote to skimpy returns for other investments. The cheap loans helped propel property values to record highs in big cities such as New York and San Francisco, alleviating concerns about the mountain of debt coming due.\n\nCredit for property owners has once again become scarce in some pockets. Borrowing costs jumped following the surprise election of President Donald Trump, and Wall Street firms are being more cautious as new regulations kick in requiring them to hold a stake in the mortgages they sell off. Other lenders are scaling back on commitments to property types and locations where problems have gotten harder to ignore.\n\nLenders are taking an increasingly dim view of retail properties \u2013 especially malls \u2013 as the growth of e-commerce eats into sales at brick-and-mortar stores. Malls tend to have higher loss rates than other property types after a default, increasing the stigma for lenders, according to Lea Overby, an analyst at Morningstar Credit Ratings.\n\nWhen malls \u201cstart to go downhill, if nothing is done to turn the ship around, they plummet,\u201d Overby said. \u201cThe fate of some of these malls is very, very uncertain.\u201d\n\nThe Sunset Mall in San Angelo, Texas, added a glow-in-the-dark mini golf course in June, part of a nationwide trend of retailers trying to lure customers with experiences they can\u2019t find online. Yet when a $28 million mortgage came due in December, the borrower couldn\u2019t refinance it, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt, part of a bond deal sold by Citigroup and Deutsche Bank in March 2007, was handed off to a firm specializing in troubled loans.\n\nA similar storyline is playing out at a 82,000-square-foot suburban office complex in Norfolk, Virginia, whose tenants include health care services firms. The borrower stopped making payments on a $20 million loan that comes due next month and can\u2019t refinance the debt, Bloomberg data show.\n\nLandlords that own high-profile buildings in big cities are faring better. At 5 Times Square, the Manhattan headquarters for Ernst & Young LLP, the owners are close to securing a five-year loan to pay off $1 billion in debt that comes due in March, according to Scott Rechler, chief executive officer of RXR Realty, which owns 49 percent of the building.\n\nRXR acquired its stake in the 39-story tower shortly after the building was sold to real estate investor David Werner for $1.5 billion in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe are currently reviewing term sheets from a number of institutions and expect to settle on a lender within a week or so,\u201d Rechler said.\n\nSome borrowers chipped away at the maturity wall by retiring their mortgages early in order to take advantage of ultra-low interest rates. At the same time, landlords with the weakest properties have already defaulted, further reducing the pool of loans that need to be refinanced.\n\nThe maturity volume has been reduced to about $90 billion from $250 billion in 2008, according to data from Morningstar.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sarah Mulholland"},"topics":[{"name":"Mortgage industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Real estate news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Another mortgage bubble to pop?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Marion","zipCode":"46204","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indianapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Journal-Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657677","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1517"},"name":"Journal-Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.journalgazette.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196952913","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T20:24:38Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Google didn\u2019t have enough Pixels available to meet demand. Rather than wait several weeks, many consumers interested in the Pixel probably bought an iPhone, Galaxy or another phone instead. And these people aren\u2019t likely to need a phone replacement for another year or two.\n\nGoogle also struck a deal to sell it through just one wireless carrier, Verizon. Although Google\u2019s online store sold Pixels compatible with other wireless networks, most people don\u2019t shop for phones that way.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Google misjudged the market, given that this is the search company\u2019s first stab at making its own phone. Previously, it partnered with various manufacturers on a Nexus line of phones to showcase its Android operating system, but that effort barely made a dent.\n\n\u201cThis was probably a really good learning experience for them,\u201d says Neil Doshi, an analyst with Mizhuo Securities USA.\n\nThe Pixel\u2019s success is important to Google because it wants to ensure there\u2019s a stylish Android phone to compete with the iPhone and drive more affluent consumers to its search engine, maps, YouTube videos and other services.\n\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy and other phones also run on Android, but those devices have been de-emphasizing Google\u2019s services.\n\nGoogle, in Mountain View, California, can afford to make some mistakes as it tries to establish the Pixel because its internet search and advertising network brings in so much revenue.\n\nAlphabet, Google\u2019s corporate parent, provided another reminder of its financial might with Thursday\u2019s release of its fourth-quarter earnings. The company earned $5.3 billion on revenue of $26 billion during the final three months of last year and profit rose 8 percent from the prior year.\n\nThe numbers provide a clue on how Pixel did. Google\u2019s \u201cother revenue\u201d segment, which covers sales outside of advertising, generated $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, a 62 percent increase from the same time last year.\n\nDoshi estimates Google sold 1 million to 1.5 million Pixels during the fourth quarter. That\u2019s just a sliver of the estimated 77 million that Apple sold and the 15 million Galaxy S7s Samsung sold in the same period.\n\nStill, analysts say the Pixel did exceptionally well for a new phone with little brand recognition.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MICHAEL LIEDTKE"},"topics":[{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Android news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Google news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Search engines news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Google learns from Pixel launch","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Marion","zipCode":"46204","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indianapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Journal-Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657677","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1517"},"name":"Journal-Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.journalgazette.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196953616","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T20:01:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://journalgazette.net/assets/13604949/17494641.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

While there is some technical ownership on paper in the form of a deed where the fractional company declares that some fraction (e.g. 1/16) of the plane is owned by the customer that\u2019s where the rosy ownership story ends. The reason it is actually a \u201clease\u201d and not really \u201cownership\u201d is that the fractional program forces a buy back of the airplane after a fixed period of time (2 years, 3 years or 5 years). If you were truly an owner, a voting majority of owners would make the decision when/if the plane needed to be sold. If you were truly an owner, you might actually fly in the plane which you own (many fractional owners never actually step foot in the actual plane with the actual tail number they \u201cown.\u201d) If you were truly an owner, you would never get \u201cshut out\u201d of your own plane like happens to most on busy holidays. \n\nCharterSmarter\u2019S FlyBright offers all of the same flight availability as are available to any fractional owner \u2013 without ANY up front commitment. \u201cThe archaic prehistoric offering known as private jet fractional ownership has been entirely disrupted,\u201d said Rick Klev, CEO of CharterSmarter. \u201cThere is not a single valid reason whatsoever for any customer to have a fractional ownership with any company \u2013 it isn\u2019t more convenient, it isn\u2019t more price effective, it doesn\u2019t offer better amenities, it doesn\u2019t offer better safety. Fractional ownership offers all benefits to the jet company, nothing to the customer! If you or your company has a current fractional ownership contract in place, just let that thing expire and move on!\u201d \n\nWith all of this in mind, the term \u201cFractional Ownership\u201d (as currently implemented by fractional ownership companies) with respect to private aviation was actually devised to fool the buyer into thinking that they are an owner. Fractional companies are actually selling \u201cstatus illusion\u201d for their customers to claim that they partially own a jet when in reality, they aren\u2019t actually owning a jet \u2013 they are really just fractional tenants of an aircraft lease and that doesn\u2019t sound very cool or market very well. \n\nWith the CharterSmarter FlyBright flight on demand private plane charter service, why would any individual or company commit to a fractional ownership headache when they can get all of the flights they want on the same planes that they want when they want it \u2013 without any long term heavy financial commitments, legal negotiations or contract overhead? \n\nAbout CharterSmarter \n\nHeadquartered in Airmont, NY CharterSmarter is revolutionizing the Private Jet Charter Marketplace.

And when you\u2019re going into one thinking it\u2019s \u201canother interview\u201d instead of \u201cThe Interview,\u201d you\u2019re unlikely to put your best foot forward. So what are some of the basics to remember no matter if it\u2019s your first interview or your tenth? \n \nDress the part: The first impression you make when you walk into an interview is visual. You want it to reflect your best self, so when you\u2019re getting dressed, you should feel like that. Yes, your clothes must fit well, be neat and clean. No, you may not need to wear a suit. Over-dressing is certainly better than under-dressing, but you want the hiring manager to be able to easily picture you in the role, so dress for it. Research the company culture and the position you\u2019re seeking and then take it up a notch. Take your outfit for a test run beforehand and see what happens to your shirt when you sit down and if your shoes are comfortable enough to walk in. Pulling on your clothes or constantly adjusting something that isn\u2019t comfortable will be distracting for you and your interview. \n \nListen: I think I put in a note about listening in everything I write, no matter what the topic. Why? Because it is essential. Listening starts before you even get in the room. Before your interview research the company \u2013 read their employee blogs and learn about the interviewer and the position. (And be sure to review your own resume, you\u2019d be surprised at how much you\u2019ve forgotten.) One of the skills your interviewer is looking for is good communication. So be sure to listen carefully. You\u2019ll get a lot of information and be able to engage with the interviewer more adeptly. Listening isn\u2019t just being quiet when the other person speaks. It means not spending that time thinking about what you\u2019re going to say next. Really listen to what is being said and you\u2019ll be able to confidently give the best, most thoughtful answers. \n \nTell your story: Part of your interview preparation is knowing what story you\u2019re going to tell. Instead of one word or one-sentence answers, tell a short, but clear, story. Focus on a theme that best suits the position and the question that was asked, whether it\u2019s about why you want the job, your leadership or your ability to work in a team. This is also an excellent way to work in relevant personal experiences. Practice your story beforehand \u2013 you can do it with a friend or even record yourself speaking. It\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll sit down in an interview and give the exact same speech about yourself, but it will be helpful to know how it sounds best. \n \nAsk questions: If you\u2019re in a first or second interview for a position, this is easy. When you\u2019re in your third, fourth or fifth, it takes more work and preparation. One candidate I know was in her last round of interviews for her dream job and had prepared everything but this. When the interviewer asked if she had any questions for him, she paused for a moment and asked, \u201cWhat are some questions I might not know to ask?\u201d hoping his answer would prompt her. What questions do you have?\u201d is a question you have to be prepared for. It not only gives you an opportunity to get answers you\u2019re seeking, but lets the interviewer know that you\u2019ve listened to what\u2019s been said, you\u2019ve thought about the job and that you\u2019re truly interested in the position. \n \nFollow up: What you wear to interviews has changed. Where they take place has changed. Maybe you\u2019ve had a virtual interview. But the \u201cthank you\u201d note has not. Send a note within 24 hours to everyone who was involved in your interview. Email is fine, but do remember that it\u2019s business correspondence and that it must be error-free and appropriately formatted. Read it out loud to yourself as you\u2019re more likely to catch typos that way. Keep the notes short and personalize them to each interviewer. You want to let them know you not only appreciated their time, but to remind them of why you\u2019re a good fit and that you took something meaningful away from the interview. \n \nMatt Nagler is managing partner, BANK W Staffing, Alexander Technology Group, KBW Financial Staffing & Recruiting, The Nagler Group, Sales Search Partners, which has a local office at Pease International Tradeport in Portsmouth.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Nagler"},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Treat every interview like it\u2019s 'The Interview'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196955323","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It\u2019s still early enough in the year that many organizations and businesses are still mapping goals for 2017.\n\nThis quote, of which there have been a few variations, is a keeper: \u201cThe smallest deed is better than the grandest intention.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s great about that philosophy is that it celebrates accomplishment \u2013 no matter how small. Sometimes, by steering a series of small steps or victories, leaders can help create the momentum to accomplish the grander visions.\n\nPlanning is key. There are plenty of tools available, but one of the simplest to remember, yet effective, may be the well-established SMART or SMARTER model. Using each letter in those words, you develop goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timely, ethical and recorded.\n\nPeople tend to love goals. It\u2019s part of imagining a better way, the \u201cwhat if.\u201d But realizing goals takes work. It takes commitment and typically requires meetings \u2013 some of them long. It takes brainstorming and compromise. It takes patience and accountability.\n\nJanuary and even February might be among the busiest months for fine-tuning vision and setting goals. But the follow-up steps and strategies in the months that come later will likely determine how serious we are about our grand intentions.\n\nHere are several more quotes about planning (and in some cases who they have been attributed to):\n\n\u2022 Plan your work and work your plan. (Napoleon Hill)\n\n\u2022 There are three kinds of people: those who make things happen; those who watch things happen; and those who wonder what happened.\n\n\u2022 Proper planning and preparation prevents poor performance. (Stephen Keague) \u2022 Plans are only good intentions unless they immediately degenerate into hard work. (Peter Drucker)\n\n\u2022 Poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part.\n\n\u2022 Sometimes we need to stop analyzing the past and start planning the future.\n\n\u2022 Good business planning is nine parts execution for every one part strategy. (Tim Berry)\n\n\u2022 If Plan A didn\u2019t work, the alphabet has 25 more letters. Stay cool.\n\n\u2022 The reason most people never reach their goals is that they don\u2019t define them. Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan to do along the way and who will be sharing the adventure with them. (Denis Waitley)\n\nHistory buff Gordon Leidner in February is scheduled to have another book released, this one titled \u201cThe Leadership Secrets of Hamilton: 7 Steps to Revolutionary Leadership from Alexander Hamilton and the Founding Fathers.\u201d\n\nHamilton, who was a treasury secretary and considered George Washington\u2019s right-hand man, has become \u201can unlikely pop culture icon in the 21st century, and now his reach extends into the office,\u201d according to a news release about the book.\n\nLeidner has written several books about Abraham Lincoln and the American Civil War. He maintains the website GreatAmericanHistory.net\n\nIn \u201cThe Leadership Secrets of Hamilton,\u201d Leidner shares principles that can be applied to modern leadership challenges, including starting a new company and motivating your workforce.\n\nEach short chapter begins with historical events demonstrating how Hamilton or another Founding Father used a featured leadership skill, along with three key actions for success that can be used today.\n\nAnecdotes and quotes help illustrate the key steps to revolutionary leadership","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Lisa Green"},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Goals need plans to become reality","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Marion","zipCode":"46204","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Indianapolis","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Journal-Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657677","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1517"},"name":"Journal-Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.journalgazette.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196957451","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T20:13:15Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://journalgazette.net/assets/13604960/17495942.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Cystic fibrosis is a disorder affecting the exocrine glands that, among other symptoms, can cause breathing problems. \n \nHer diagnosis was a factor in the creation of Stratacuity (a combination of Strategy and Acuity) by Marshall and co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Rob Patten in 2001, and it continues to propel the company today in its effort to affect advancements in biomedical research and medicine. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a good market,\u201d Patten said of the biopharmaceutical industry, \u201cit puts people, scientists in a position to make a real difference.\u201d \n \nThat includes making a difference for people such as Kate, who at age 15, as an all-star soccer player and student athlete at York High School, was named a Sports Illustrated High School Athlete of the Month for December 2014. \n \nMarshall and Patten worked together in a recruiting company that specialized in high technology in the late 1990s. \n \nWith Kate\u2019s birth and diagnosis, Marshall \u2013 describing himself as \u201csad, scared\u201d \u2013 did what every parent would do. He learned as much about the ailment as he possibly could including its treatments, research to address it and what options there were to not only manage the disorder but perhaps find a longer-term prognosis. \n \n\u201cMy curiosity got the best of me,\u201d he said. \n \nHis research pointed him to what was happening in biopharma in the Boston/Cambridge area of Massachusetts and the venture capital investments that were being made in the research. \n \n\u201cThat was something Rob and I could relate to,\u201d he said. \n \nThey tried to spin off a division specific to the biopharma industry within the recruiting company they were working for but met resistance, so they struck out on their own, creating Stratacuity and operating initially in a small office on Islington Street. \n \n\u201cThe philosophy early on was to get a good client and then do everything they wanted us to do,\u201d Patten said. \n \nThere are two parts to the business \u2013 the recruiting and the staffing. \n \nFor the recruitment part, Stratacuity identifies top talent to, as it says, help companies handle \u201ca wide range of scientific skill sets to find your needle-in-the-haystack talent.\u201d \n \n\u201cAs long as patients need innovative medicines,\u201d Patten said in his LinkedIn profile, \u201cI will be helping my clients hire the best scientists to discover and develop them.\u201d \n \nStratacuity develops a relationship \u2013 ideally a long-term relationship \u2013 with the people it recruits. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a relationship, it\u2019s not transactional,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWhen we connect with someone we can see a great number of years ahead that we\u2019ll be working together.\u201d \n \nStratacuity started its staffing part of the business in 2006 and now has 100 of its employees contracted out to various biopharma and biotechnology companies mostly in the Boston/Cambridge area. \n \nStratacuity has 25 people working at its Cate Street location, where it\u2019s been since 2007. According to Marshall and Patten, the privately held company has, on average, doubled its revenue in each of the last 24 months. \n \nThey love Portsmouth and have no intention of leaving. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to move away from such a beautiful place,\u201d said Marshall, and they recruit heavily from the University of New Hampshire in Durham. \n \nAnd they have strong beliefs of what New Hampshire should do in terms of enhancing its job growth, particularly around biotech. Forget about biotech and biopharma research, they say, and concentrate instead on biotech and biopharma manufacturing. \n \n\u201cWe need more Lonzas,\u201d Marshall said in reference to Lonza Biologics, the company at Pease International Tradeport that custom manufactures ingredients for pharmaceutical products. \n \nNew Hampshire can\u2019t compete with Boston and particularly Cambridge for the research end of the industry, but they say Lonza has shown the state has a capacity to attract and keep the manufacturing end. \n \n\u201cWe can start being proactive that we want to be a bio-manufacturing state,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWe have to learn how to start making these drugs perfect every time.\u201d \n \nStratacuity\u2019s passion for making a difference is also evident in its community outreach. \n \nAs an example, for Christmas employees all received Yeti coolers, and they collectively decided, rather than keep the coolers, to fill with them with non-perishable food and donate them to the Seacoast Family Food Pantry. Each cooler holds about 20 to 30 pounds of food and 18 coolers were filled. \n \nPatten himself is a 2016 recipient of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Breath of Life Award that is given to someone not personally afflicted by the disease but who makes a difference in the foundation\u2019s work. \n \n\u201cRob has been there for 15-plus years,\u201d Marshall said in a video created to mark the company\u2019s 15th anniversary. \u201cHe was there for a few days at my house after Kate was diagnosed. He was at the first golf tournament that my wife and I had to raise money for CF. And he said yes when I told him about this idea of starting a recruitment company to make a difference in the lives of people.\u201d \n \nThe professional outreach Stratacuity does within the industry has also made a difference. \n \nMarshall said at least three companies have started CF research at his suggestion. \n \n\u201cIt was really rewarding to help influence them,\u201d he said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Paul Briand business@seacoastonline.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Biotech news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Stratacuity strives to advance biomedical research, medicine","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196957629","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Has Released A New Mobile App Aimed At Giving A More User Friendly And Convenient Experience To Customers.\n\nSparta, New Jersey (PRWEB) January 27, 2017 \n\nThe Extreme Kleaner brand of green cleaning products from Extreme Energy Solutions has achieved notable growth, especially over the last several months in particular. Extreme Kleaner is a non-toxic biodegradable cleaning product line which includes an all-purpose cleaner-degreaser and window cleaner, both made in the USA.\n\nExtreme Kleaner was first offered online directly on the Extreme Kleaner website, then shortly after, it was sold on Amazon. In 2013 and 2014, local New Jersey and North Eastern retailers began to offer the green cleaner in their stores. By year end 2015, Extreme Kleaner was available in several hardware store chains, auto parts stores, and food stores coast to coast in various states. \n\n2016 brought many new opportunities for Extreme Kleaner including both a number of co-ops and larger big box retailers taking on the product. 2017 carries the momentum by opening up with the launch of Extreme Kleaner in Menards.\n\nSteady growth in market share has resulted in Extreme Kleaner now being available in a number of selected independently owned retailer locations nationwide, including many hardware stores, auto parts stores, grocery markets, and variety stores. Brand stores that now offer Extreme Kleaner include: Hardware Hanks, Trustworthy Hardware, Golden Rule Lumber, Ranch and Pet Supply, other stores affiliated with United Hardware, selected NAPA Auto Parts, selected Ace Hardware stores, selected True Value Hardware stores, stores affiliated with C&S Wholesale Grocers, and now Menards.\n\nMenards, one of the largest home improvement chains in the Mid-West, now stocks Extreme Kleaner in all of its 300 plus retail locations and also offer the eco-friendly cleaner in their online store.\n\n\u201cWe are very grateful and appreciative of the opportunity to partner with Menards. This was one of our long term goals for our company and for Extreme Kleaner, and we have found the Menards team to be very helpful and knowledgeable,\u201d commented Samuel K. Burlum, CEO and President of Extreme Energy Solutions, Inc. Extreme Energy Solutions has opted not to be left behind in the mobile app movement. They are now joining the ranks of the majority of businesses that are seizing the opportunity to increase customer engagement, revenue and brand awareness.\n\n\u201cWith the rapid market adoption of the Extreme Kleaner product line, the next logical step was to create a mobile app for the product to enhance the customer experience. This new tool allows us to offer the customer more ease and convenience of service and it also provides a platform for us to increase customer engagement which helps foster community and build more brand loyalty\u201d commented Jeff Smith, Communications Director of Extreme Energy Solutions.\n\nThe Extreme Kleaner mobile app is now available for download and use at the iTunes / Apple Store as well as the Google Play / Android store.\n\nCustomers who install the app can expect many benefits. They can order product right from the app, they can easily access the company\u2019s social media and brand websites, locate a nearby retailer, and receive special coupons, discounts and promotions, as well as several other benefits.\n\nJust like 20 years ago, when companies that did not create a website for their business were quickly left behind in the market, business is experiencing a similar revolution today with mobile apps. Companies and brands that do not have a mobile app available to their customers are quickly being left behind. The vast majority of internet use today is through mobile devices. Extreme Energy Solutions wanted to stay ahead of the curve and offer a user friendly mobile app for Extreme Kleaner right when the product was starting to take off in popularity with national chains and suppliers.\n\nDuring 2016, the Extreme Kleaner team made a \u201cTour of Stores\u201d road trip where they visited many retailers including the United Hardware family- Hardware Hanks, and other retailers such as Ace Hardware and True Value to deliver product, set up in-store promotions and spread the word of Extreme Kleaner\u2019s availability.\n\n2017 will also include a Tour of Stores, where the Extreme Kleaner markting team will again take to the road for dozens of in-store visits and promotional appearances. However, this year they will have an additional value to offer their customers. The mobile app is expected to tie in seamlessly with existing promotions and marketing campaigns, including the successful motorsports sponsorship program.\n\nThe Extreme Kleaner mobile app is expected to be utilized vigorously this year by fans of the brand. Extreme Energy Solutions plans on maximizing the use of this tool by creating several exciting promotions, special discounts and holding fun contests and drawings for its mobile app users in 2017.\n\nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb1398476","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Mobile industry news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Apps news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Wireless industry news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"South Pacific Islands news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Product launch news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Extreme Energy Solutions Launches New Mobile App For Customers Of Extreme Kleaner Product Line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Micronesia","countryCode":"GU","country":"Guam"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kuam News 8","feed":{"genre":"Press Release","tags":[],"id":"170519371","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"name":"Kuam News 8","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Wires"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kuam.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://extremekleaner.com/","https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/extreme-kleaner/id1188063291","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BargainMobileApps.ExtremeKleaner","http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb13984760.htm","http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb1398476"],"sequenceId":"695196958793","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:48:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:33:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}
