Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale\u2019s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\u201cThe judge\u2019s order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US \u2014 it doesn\u2019t immediately order that they be released from detention,\u201d he told CNN. \n \n\u201cWe are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\u201d he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \u201cour courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump\u2019s controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \u201conly for nationals of countries for whom\u201d members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump\u2019s order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\u201cAmerica is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump\u2019s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump\u2019s order and pledged continued action. \n \n\u201cThis should not happen in America,\u201d Velazquez said following Darweesh\u2019s release. \u201cOne by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\u201d \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\u201cBecause the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK\u2019s Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\u201cWhen Mr. Darweesh\u2019s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u2018Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\u201d the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\u201cOur courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump\u2019s order puts those who have helped us in harm\u2019s way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, titled \u201cProtection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\u201cI am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security.\u201d \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Boone","zipCode":"65201","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Columbia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KFRU-AM","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"505479189","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"KFRU-AM","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://kfru.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/ny-immigration-order-stay/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695202832688","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:16:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

\nTechnology industry executives expressed personal dismay and concern for their companies in reacting to President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration. \n \nIn company emails, interviews and posts published online, leaders from companies including Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. framed the order as one at odds with a nation that welcomes foreigners and an industry that counts foreign-born executives in its upper ranks. In doing so, they broke with weeks of cautious engagement with the new administration. \n \nHere is a rundown of their statements. \n \nApple CEO \n \nTim Cook \n \nTeam, \n \nIn my conversations with officials here in Washington this week, I've made it clear that Apple believes deeply in the importance of immigration--both to our company and to our nation's future. Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do. \n \nI've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support. \n \nThere are employees at Apple who are directly affected by yesterday's immigration order. Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them. We're providing resources on AppleWeb for anyone with questions or concerns about immigration policies. And we have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our co-workers and our company. \n \nAs I've said many times, diversity makes our team stronger. And if there's one thing I know about the people at Apple, it's the depth of our empathy and support for one another. It's as important now as it's ever been, and it will not weaken one bit. I know I can count on all of you to make sure everyone at Apple feels welcome, respected and valued. \n \nApple is open. Open to everyone, no matter where they come from, which language they speak, who they love or how they worship. Our employees represent the finest talent in the world, and our team hails from every corner of the globe. \n \nIn the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, \"We may have all come on different ships, but we are in the same boat now.\" \n \nMicrosoft CEO \n \nSatya Nadella \n \nAs an immigrant and as a CEO, I've both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world. We will continue to advocate on this important topic. \n \nMicrosoft President \n \nBrad Smith \n \nAs a company, Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system. We also believe in broader immigration opportunities, like the protections for talented and law-abiding young people under the Deferred Access for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program, often called \"Dreamers.\" We believe that immigration laws can and should protect the public without sacrificing people's freedom of expression or religion. And we believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings. \n \n(Full statement here.) \n \nGoogle CEO \n \nSundar Pichai \n \nWe're upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S....It's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues. \n \nUber Technologies CEO \n \nTravis Kalanick \n \nExpedia CEO \n \nDara Khosrowshahi \n \nOurs is a nation of immigrants. These are our roots, this is our soul. All erased with the stroke of a pen. I was incredibly fortunate to arrive in the U.S. with my family after the Iranian revolution. I don't have an Iranian passport and have never been back but have no idea if I'm on a list someplace listed as an Iranian citizen. And I'm a lucky one. We should strive for safe borders. But we have a responsibility as the world's greatest nation. And we sure aren't acting our part. \n \nFacebook \n \nCEO \n \nMark Zuckerberg \n \nMy great-grandparents came from Germany, Austria and Poland. Priscilla's parents were refugees from China and Vietnam. The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that. \n \nLike many of you, I'm concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump. \n \nWe need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don't pose a threat will live in fear of deportation. \n \n(Full statement here.) \n \nTesla Motors \n \nCEO \n \nElon Musk \n \nMany people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the U.S. They've done right, not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected....The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country's challenges \n \nTweets: https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502618680045568 and https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502400454594561 \n \nCode.org CEO \n \nHadi Partovi \n \nMy family left Iran to escape a bloody war when I was 11, during the Reagan administration. America welcomed us as legal immigrants with visas. Code.org and the Hour of Code wouldn't exist otherwise. \n \n(Facebook post here.) \n \nAirbnb CEO \n \nBrian Chesky \n \nOpen doors brings all of US together. Closing doors further divides US. Let's all find ways to connect people, not separate them. \n \nTweet: https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/825407087085645824 \n \nY Combinator President \n \nSam Altman \n \nThe tech community is powerful. Large tech companies in particular have enormous power and are held in high regard. We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally. Although there is some business risk in doing so, there is strength in numbers--if everyone does it early this coming week, we will all make each other stronger. \n \n(Full statement here.) \n \nNetflix \n \nCEO \n \nReed Hastings \n \nTrump's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all. Worse, these actions will make America less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe.

Anyone who believes that this order could impact them should contact [email protected] immediately. \n \nThis order has far broader implications as it also affects thousands of drivers who use Uber and come from the listed countries, many of whom take long breaks to go back home to see their extended family. These drivers currently outside of the U.S. will not be able to get back into the country for 90 days. That means they will not be able to earn a living and support their families--and of course they will be separated from their loved ones during that time. \n \nWe are working out a process to identify these drivers and compensate them pro bono during the next three months to help mitigate some of the financial stress and complications with supporting their families and putting food on the table.

Angelelli is about a minute ahead of Renger van der Zande, who is driving the No. 90 Riley for VisitFlorida Racing. \n\nIf Angelelli and his teammates can stay there, they would clinch a victory in Gordon's first Rolex 24 race in a decade and give Angelelli a win in his final race. Angelelli is retiring as a full-time driver and focusing on co-owning the team and running the Cadillac program. \n\nOther class leaders at the halfway mark: Joey Hand in the No. 66 Ford in the GT Le Mans class; Nicholas Boulle in the No. 38 Oreca in the Prototype Challenge class; and Jeff Segel in the No. 86 Acura in the GT Daytona class. \n\n--- \n\n12:30 a.m. \n\nThe Tequila Patron team has reason for some late-night shots. \n\nBrendon Hartley, driving on cold tires, turned into a Porsche driven by Wolf Henzler and crashed hard into the outside wall at Daytona International Speedway with about 14 hours to go in the Rolex 24 race early Sunday. Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year. \n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car. He turned it over to Seb Morris in third as the Cadillac teams had put all but one car in the prototype class at least a lap down. \n\n--- \n\n2:30 p.m. \n\nThe 55th running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona is underway, with pole-sitter Joao Barbosa leading the 55-car field to the green flag. \n\nThe twice-around-the-clock endurance race began under cool temperatures and cloudy skies, with a threat of steady rain predicted for later Saturday. \n\nFour-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon started the race in the pits, with Wayne Taylor Racing teammate Ricky Taylor opening behind the wheel of the No. 10 Cadillac. \n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" runner-up and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe, four-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay also are in the field. \n\nChip Ganassi Racing, which has dominated the Rolex in recent years, has two entries. One of them includes Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais, who won their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: celebrity gossip","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"The Latest: Jeff Gordon, Taylor Racing halfway home to Rolex","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sedgwick","zipCode":"67202","state":"Kansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Wichita","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wichita Eagle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665895","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6865"},"name":"Wichita Eagle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Gossip","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kansas.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202852624","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

While the post carries political prestige, it is largely a ceremonial job tasked with advising China's rubber-stamp parliament. \n \nChina investigates ex-mayor of Tianjin for bribery \nBeijing (AFP) Jan 22, 2017 - An official who was mayor of a northern Chinese city when a massive chemical explosion killed at least 165 people is under investigation for bribery, the country's top prosecuting authority said Sunday. \n \nHuang Xingguo, 62, headed the response committee after the explosion rocked Tianjin in August 2015, devastating a huge swathe of the port city. \n \nHe was also acting party chief of the municipality at the time. \n \nIn a brief statement posted Sunday by the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the country's top prosecuting office, it said it was investigating Huang \"on suspicion of taking bribes\" and had taken \"coercive measures\". \n \nSuch measures may include residential surveillance, summons by force, and detention, according to the official Xinhua news agency. \n \nThe statement did not mention the Tianjin disaster, China's highest-profile industrial accident in years. \n \nIn November Chinese courts jailed almost 50 company managers and government officials over the deadly blasts for charges ranging from illegal storage of materials to abuse of power. \n \nA government report found that officials had routinely ignored or violated laws and regulations on chemical storage. \n \nFears of toxic pollution were rife following the explosion, with cyanide levels in the disaster zone far above national limits.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"China news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"China sentences former senior official to life term for graft","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Sino Daily","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"598029570","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Sino Daily","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sinodaily.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202853340","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Contra Costa","zipCode":"94597","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Walnut Creek","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Walnut Creek Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169721878","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Walnut Creek Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.walnutcreek.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695202862055","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O\u2019Hare\u2019s international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n \nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O\u2019Hare all released by late Saturday. \n\nAmong those released before the federal judge\u2019s order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n\nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O\u2019Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S.citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n\nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n\nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \u201cI can\u2019t believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\u201d \n\n \nA woman holds a sign during a protest against the travel ban imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order, at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Dallas, Texas, Jan. 28, 2017. \n \n\u200b \nDALLAS \nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump\u2019s executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \u201cSet them free!\u2019\u2019 At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n\nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son\u2019s petition. \n\nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn\u2019t talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n\nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \u201cThis is what democracy looks like.\u201d \n\nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n\n\u201cThey were like a machine when I talked to them today,\u2019\u2019 he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n\nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n\n\u201cShe was about to cry,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\u201d \n\nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n\n\u201cTo have a better life and to make more money,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, you know, for the freedom.\u2019\u2019 \n\nSEATTLE \nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \u201cWe are America.\u201d Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women\u2019s March. \u201cIt\u2019s not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\u201d said Khalaf, 29. \n \nPORTLAND, OREGON \nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \u201cSay it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\u201d and \u201cNo ban no wall America is for us all.\u201d \n \nLOS ANGELES \nAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport\u2019s Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil. \n\nAvriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis. \n\nSAN FRANCISC O \nHundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport\u2019s international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. \n \nSAN DIEGO \nAs motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \u201cNo hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"webdesk@voanews.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US immigration news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Trump Immigration Order Prompts Protests at Airports Across US","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"VOA News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669350","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"8778"},"name":"VOA News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.voanews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202862273","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:35Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://gdb.voanews.com/D0561C8B-9DAA-4A25-AB72-A5313F17BDD8_cx0_cy12_cw0_w800_h450.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The prime minister had told the House that Yunus does not pay taxes against fixed deposit with banks and sues authorities when asked to pay tax.\n\nHasina also said that the sources of Yunus' income were unknown.\n\nYunus Centre dismissed the allegation of tax evasion as 'completely false'.\n\nThe statement said Yunus' incomes come from three sources -- fee for lectures at conferences, royalties from books and from fixed deposits generated from those incomes.\n\nIt said that his earnings from lectures and royalty from books are remitted to Bangladesh through proper banking channels and the details are documented with the banks and also submitted to the tax authorities.\n\nYunus keeps his money in fixed deposits with banks and has no investments, the statement said citing that taxes on those are paid at source.\n\nHasina also said that Grameen Bank enjoys a tax benefit, but there are 40 to 50 other sister concerns, who also don't pay tax. \"Why will they not pay taxes? The NBR has those reports.\"\n\nFinance Minister AMA Muhith followed up the statement and told the media the next day a probe will be launched into it.\n\nThe statement described it as a 'completely baseless accusation.' It said all organisations created by Yunus pay tax, VAT and none of them enjoys any tax benefit.\n\nOn Wednesday, an angry Hasina went on to describe Yunus as a 'cheat' over Grameenphone as he breached the promise he made before setting up the telecom entity.\n\n\"This lobbying that he did...at that time he obtained the Grameenphone (GP) licence from me. Ask him, did he even offer me a cup of tea for the licence? \"On the contrary, it was I who invited him to my office, offered him tea and gave him business,\" a miffed prime minister said adding he did not pass on the profits from the telecoms venture to Grameen Bank.\n\nThe statement said that GP was joint venture with Norway's state-owned Telenor as the lead partner and Grameen Telecom, a non-profit entity with no private owners and registered under the Company Act, was the second owner.\n\nYunus Centre claimed that profits from GP that come to Grameen Telecom are used for projects that 'support the welfare of the common people' through Grameen Telecom Trust.\n\nIt said all GP documents are available with the government.\n\n\"Professor Yunus never owned any share of Grameenphone at any stage of the company, nor does he own any share now. Therefore, the question of his selling shares to anyone does not arise. \n\n\"Similarly, since Grameen Bank did not own any share of Grameenphone at any time, the question of Grameen Bank selling shares of GP does not arise either. Grameen Telecom never sold any of its shares to anyone except in the case of selling shares to general public, as agreed by all partners of Grameenphone and the Government of Bangladesh,\" the statement added.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Bangladesh news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Yunus Centre protests Hasina's remarks","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"BD","country":"Bangladesh"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Bdnews24.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667953","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"128"},"name":"Bdnews24.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Financials","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bdnews24.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://bdnews24.com/economy/2017/01/29/yunus-centre-protests-pm-hasina-s-statement-made-in-parliament&src=sdkpreparse","http://www.printfriendly.com/","http://delivery.ritsads.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=ff614e8f84&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE","http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript","http://disqus.com/","http://delivery.ritsads.com/w/1.0/rc?cs=9e5f0d291c&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"],"sequenceId":"695202866144","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2017/01/29/yunus-centre-rejoinder.jpg/ALTERNATES/w640/Yunus+Centre-Rejoinder.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It's bad for the country and undermining your administration at what should be its strongest point.\n\nWe don't want you to fail, President Trump. Your success equates to the country's success. But, in just a matter of days, you've displayed a striking need for universal veneration. You long to be worshiped by the masses. You need to be considered legitimate. You want people to admire you for simply holding the office.\n\nIf it doesn't end, it's impossible to see how your administration will govern successfully.\n\nLet's use your inauguration as an example. You reportedly seethed after pictures on Twitter showed a rather sparse crowd. Your spokesman, Sean Spicer, came out the next day and read a terse statement that was patently untrue about attendance, or lack thereof. He quickly backtracked Monday. Your less-official mouthpiece Kellyanne Conway defended the administration's reaction with a new term for untruth, \"alternative facts.\" \n\nIt's clear all of this was done because you, President Trump, can't stand that millions of people don't like you. \n\nBut that's where things stand. Polls show you have the highest disapproval rating of any modern president at this early phase of his term. Some 45 percent of Americans dislike your handling thus far, according to Gallup. Just 36 percent approve. Those are incredible statistics, of which you should take note. A failure to do so comes at your own peril.\n\nWhat's perhaps most shocking is your apparent surprise at the lack of universal adoration. You ran probably the darkest campaign in centuries. Your rhetoric belittled minorities, women and thousands of members of the media. Many of the Republican leaders now smiling beside you at photo ops blasted the things you said and stood for. Speaker Paul Ryan once called your words the \"textbook definition of racism.\" Your own vice president, before joining the ticket, labeled your widely hyped Muslim ban unconstitutional. \n\nThe day after your election victory, you promised to be a president for the entire country. And then, as if campaigning is all you know how to do, you embarked on a \"thank you\" tour to the states you won. The world is more complex than simply winning and losing. This isn't a football game.\n\nEven now, your impulsive egotism leads to the vilification and degradation of hardworking Americans. On Monday, you falsely claimed that millions of fraudulent voters are what cost you the popular vote against Hillary Clinton. Every time you repeat that fabrication, you're undermining democracy itself and, in the process, belittling the jobs done by election officials in states and counties throughout the country. \n\nIt's utterly perplexing that, after all this, you expect total adulation from the very people whom you spent 18 months attacking. You're neither king nor religious prophet. Respect isn't compulsory. And your distaste for dissent is alarming. \n\nTo be clear, we don't agree with large segments of your platform. Your border wall has the whiff of a boondoggle-in-waiting. Your unwillingness to divest yourself of your many business holdings fosters legitimate questions about your allegiances. Your cabinet is stocked with the very billionaire class that you said owned Clinton. Your gag order on federal regulators is an affront to transparency and smacks of the politicization of science. \n\nBut all that doesn't mean you don't make a point or two. Flippantly cobbled free trade deals have contributed to massive pain throughout the Rust Belt, yet a trade war would end badly for Quad-Cities manufacturers and thousands of employees. There are certainly opportunities to get some of the hundreds of billions stashed offshore back into circulation in the U.S. While our allies should be supported, it's true that, as measured by gross domestic product, the U.S. footed more than its share of the bill over the years.\n\nMillions of Americans spent the day after your inauguration protesting you, Mr. President. They assembled in towns and cities across the country.\n\nThey're scared. They're scared you might come after them now that you wield such immense power. Who can blame them? Your hand is too busy feverishly banging away on Twitter to be steady. You're too wrapped up in perceived slights to focus on the country. This country is about more than . You have a small window to right things and show all Americans that you're their president, regardless of policy differences. It won't happen unless you drop the vanity. It won't happen until you ditch the divisive campaign rhetoric and binary world view. Of greatest import, it won't happen until you realize that the presidency isn't about one man or his television ratings.\n\nYou still have time, President Trump -- time to turn it around, time to prove us all wrong.\n\nSo, please, Mr. President. Act the part.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Quad-City Times editorial board"},"topics":[{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Editorial: An open letter to President Trump","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Scott","zipCode":"52801","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Davenport","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"QC Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169762840","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1558"},"name":"QC Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.qctimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202867204","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/qctimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/28/02826553-5a73-5fe3-8058-2cbf3bf9c9c7/588b8e686a93f.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C720%2C0%2C44&amp;resize=1120%2C630&amp;order=crop%2Cresize"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 52 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Polk","zipCode":"50309","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Des Moines","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KCCI","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659157","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1116"},"name":"KCCI","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kcci.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202869098","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Next weekend is forecast to again hit 40 degrees, Mr Taggart said, as the Bureau forecasts a \"hotter than average\" February with hot conditions pushing into March. \n \nJanuary is also likely to end with less than half the month's average rainfall. So far the city has had 48.8mm, much lower than the average of 102.5mm. \n \nIt's also significantly less than last year when Sydney received 249.8mm during January. \n \nElsewhere in the state, Moree is in the middle of a remarkable hot streak, with the town sweltering through 34 consecutive days above 35 degrees.

That would be Zach Randolph, who bullied Trey Lyles on the block and drew Rudy Gobert out to the perimeter en route to a season-high 28 points on 12-for-20 shooting. The Jazz played without Derrick Favors (rest) and had no answer for Randolph's brute physicality. \n \nRodney Hood scored a team-high 20 points for the Jazz (30-19), while George Hill added 16 points and five assists. \n \nRudy Gobert and Alec Burks finished with 15 points each, and Gordon Hayward had 14 points, eight rebounds and five assists in the loss. \n \nPoint guard Mike Conley (23 points) and All-Star center Marc Gasol (18 points) also played well in the win for the Grizzlies (28-21). \n \nSaturday's Best \n \nAfter missing five games with a knee injury and shaking off the rust with a five-point performance on Thursday, Hood had a much-needed solid showing. He shot 7-for-12 from the field (including 4-for-6 from 3-point range) for his first 20-point game since December 13, and he added four rebounds and a block in 30 minutes. \n \nKey Stretch \n \nA huge slam by Gobert pulled Utah to within three with just over five minutes left, but Conley drilled a step-back three and then, after a no-call when Hill was bumped shooting a 3-pointer, Conley sank another jumper from just behind the free-throw line to push Memphis' lead back to eight. \n  \n#MEMatUTA  pic.twitter.com/nwTJVlP2vq \n\u2014 Utah Jazz (@utahjazz) January 29, 2017  \nSignificant Stats \n \n-16 \n \nThe Grizzlies owned the post, outscoring Utah 48-32 in the paint. \n \n60.9 \n \nMemphis' big three of Randolph (12-for-20), Conley (9-for-14) and Gasol (7-for-12) combined for 69 points on 28-for-46 (60.9 percent) shooting. \n \nCoach's Quote of the Night \n  \n\"Needless to say, [Conley, Gasol and Randolph] were terrific. ...

The Jazz have lost two home games to Western Conference teams that were below them in the standings \u2014 Oklahoma City and Memphis. These are games you need to win if you are trying to get home court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. In both cases, the best players of the opponent (Westbrook, Conley and Gasol) were superior to the Jazz\u2019s rising stars.  The Jazz are now just 8-14 against +.500 teams. This is well below their placement in the standings. The Jazz are terrific against teams that are below .500, 22-4, one of the best records in the league. However, they have not been able to get over the hump against the better teams with consistency.  Derrick Favors didn\u2019t play tonight.  The Jazz played a lot of Hill, Hood, Hayward, Johnson and Gobert in the second half. This is a lineup that many of us thought would be the closing lineup for the Jazz this season. It had only played 13 minutes this season coming into the game and 10 of those were in November.  This is a great win by Memphis. They lost last night in Portland and had lost 5 of their last 8. They are on the second stop of a long, six-game road trip. Their veterans realized they had to win. They have so much experience together over the years and were able to summon all of it tonight in a much needed win.  Gasol was terrific tonight. Zach Randolph had a season high. Mike Conley dominated the fourth quarter, scoring nine points and seven in a row in the key portion of the fourth quarter.  The Jazz\u2019s offense is 29 th  in the league in second quarters and tonight, the second quarter was another struggle: 5 of 19 shooting and just 16 points. I have no idea what is causing this. The Jazz were built entirely with the concept of being able to put out a complete 48-minute line-up, so it is strange that the Jazz are having such a stark issue in the second quarters of games.  For all my talk of offense, so far the issue tonight was on the defensive end. The pace of the game was 84 possessions which is incredibly slow. The Jazz play the slowest pace in the league at 93.5 possessions. The league average offensive rating is 104 pts per 100 possessions. Tonight, the Grizzlies\u2019 offense was at 124 pts per 100 possessions and the Jazz were scoring at 116 pts per 100 possessions.  Alec Burks had another double-figure night with 15 points on just 4 of 5 shooting. However, his five turnovers were not good. The Jazz were +1 in the minutes Alec played at the point guard.  Gordon Hayward was only 4 of 13 tonight.  Rudy Gobert went 9 for 9 from the free throw line. Rudy had five FGA tonight; He had just three last time versus Memphis.  This is really an impressive win by the Memphis Grizzlies. They were pros tonight and understood how important the win was. Memphis wins the season series, 3-1, and avoid a losing streak on the road trip.  Losing to Memphis and OKC at home is not great. The Jazz are home for the next two.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Utah Jazz news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Memphis Grizzlies news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NBA news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Emptying the Noggin \u2014 Memphis wins like pros","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"NBA","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667028","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6982"},"name":"NBA","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer","Basketball"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nba.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202871528","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:48:49Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://i.cdn.turner.com/drp/nba/jazz/sites/default/files/styles/media_thumbnail/public/getty-images-632959492.jpg?itok=fZzYcXV9"}],"video":[]}}

Asim Saeed is the third man to have been recovered among five social media activists gone missing. \n \nThe sister of Asim Saeed told BBC Urdu that we are happy on his safe return and thankful to the Almighty. She refused to share more detail into the matter, BBC said. \n \nThe missing blogger, poet, human rights activist and a professor at the Fatima Jinnah Women University Salman Haider, on Saturday reached home safely after three weeks. \n \nAccording to private television channels, another missing activist from Lahore Waqas Goraya also returned home. Late night there were reports that other missing activists had also returned homes but these reports could not be confirmed. \n \nHaider disappeared on Jan 6 from Banigala and his car was found from the precincts of Koral Police Station. \n \nThe human rights activists had staged several protests in major cities of the country for his recovery. An FIR for his alleged kidnapping was also registered at the Lohi Bher Police Station by his brother, Zeeshan Haider, under Section 365 of the Pakistan Penal Code. \n \nThe Islamabad Police confirmed the news relating to the safe return of Salman Haider and said that he returned home on late Friday night (Jan 27), adding that he was all healthy with no apparent injuries; however he did not record any statement about his disappearance episode. \"The police investigators are unable yet to meet or interview Salman Haider after his recovery,\" a top police officer said. \n \nQuoting his family sources, the police officer said that Salman Haider was not in a condition to face police questions, however, a police party would meet him probably on Sunday after getting permission from his family. \n \nIt is also pertinent to state that Interior Minister Ch Nisar Ali Khan, while taking notice of the case, had categorically instructed the police to solve the mystery as early as possible. was posted in National of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 29, 2017 and was last updated on January 29, 2017.

He hit 12 of 18 field-goal attempts and 8 of 16 free-throw attempts and added six rebounds and three assists. \n\nBronson Koenig added 10, four on free throws in the overtime, but made just 2 of 10 3-pointers and 2 of 13 shots overall. \n\nUW made 3 of 25 3-point attempts (12.5 percent) and 20 of 60 shots overall (33.3 percent). \n\nNigel Hayes added seven points, a game-high 11 rebounds and four assists. He had five points in the overtime, as well as an assist on a basket by Happ. \n\nThe Badgers (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) continued their run through the league with their fifth consecutive victory since suffering an 11-point loss Jan. 8 at Purdue. \n\nUW won for the 14th time in the last 15 games overall and improved to 6-3 away from the Kohl Center this season (3-1 neutral site, 3-2 road). \n\nGuards Corey Sanders and Nigel Johnson scored 15 and 13 points, respectively, for Rutgers. \n\nRutgers, which suffered a 20-point loss to UW in Madison, saw its record fall to 1-8 in the league and 12-10 overall. \n\nThe Scarlet Knights entered the day as the Big Ten's worst shooting team in league play but the Badgers appeared determined to steal that title. \n\nThe Badgers, shooting 40.2 percent from 3-point range and 46.4 percent overall in Big Ten play, looked as if they hadn't practiced shooting for weeks. \n\nThey made 1 of 13 3-pointers (8.3 percent), 5 of 25 shots overall (20 percent) and went the last 10:36 of the half without a field goal. \n\nKoenig was 0 of 5 from 3-point range and 0 of 6 overall.

Hayes was 0 of 2, leaving the trio a combined 0 of 10 for the half. \n\nIf not for the early burst of Happ, who scored 10 of his 11 points in the first 4:15, UW's deficit would have been greater than five points. \n\nUW missed its last 12 field goal attempts of the half and lost the battle for points in the paint, 14-8 to Rutgers. \n\nThe Badgers missed their first six shots of the second half before Happ scored inside, with 16:44 left. \n\nThat ended UW's run of misses at 18 in a row and a span of 13:52. \n\nOuch.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JEFF POTRYKUSMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Happ helps Wisconsin escape Rutgers in OT, 61-54","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Centre","zipCode":"16823","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bellefonte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Centre Daily Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657424","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"756"},"name":"Centre Daily Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.centredaily.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202884355","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. \n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. \n\nThe Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up. Crowder scored eight of the Celtics' first 11 points to help Boston get out to a nine-point lead in the first 21/2 minutes. \n\nThat was just the beginning of what ended up as a 42-point first quarter for the Celtics. With Crowder leading the way with 11 points and Thomas chipping in 10, the Celtics picked apart the Bucks' defense on the way to 63.2 percent shooting from the field in the period in addition to 11-of-11 shooting from the free-throw line. Gerald Green put the exclamation point on the quarter by making a 25-footer before the buzzer that gave the Celtics a 42-27 lead after 12 minutes. \n\nIn that opening stanza, the Bucks got nothing from Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker. Milwaukee's leading scorers combined to go 0-of-8 from the field as Michael Beasley shouldered the scoring load off the bench with 11 points. \n\nAntetokounmpo made his first three shots of the second quarter, including a pair of dunks, to highlight an 8-0 run that brought the Bucks within eight, but that was as close as they would get. That's because Thomas subbed back in and went on a tear. He got fouled shooting a 3-pointer and made all three free throws, made a 26-footer and a 30-footer and hooked a left-handed layup over Snell on the way to scoring 13 points in the final six minutes of the second quarter, putting him at 23 at the half.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MATT VELAZQUEZMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Milwaukee Bucks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Boston Celtics news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Thomas shines again as Celtics hold off Bucks for 112-108 OT win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Centre","zipCode":"16823","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bellefonte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Centre Daily Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657424","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"756"},"name":"Centre Daily Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.centredaily.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202885032","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fairfield","zipCode":"06801","state":"Connecticut","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bethel","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bethel Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172077648","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Bethel Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bethel.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695202889698","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The \"sanitised\" report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). \n \nThe report, whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986. \n \nThe very first sentence of the report's available (undeleted) page reads: \"Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\" It, however, later clearly said that \"assassination is the major near-term threat\" to him. \n \nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991. \n \nThe first section titled \"Key Judgments\" analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India's relations with the US, the then USSR and the region. \n \nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi's life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder. \n \n\"If Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures - including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India - were taken by the Indian President ......(deleted),\" it said. \n \nInterestingly, it also names P V Narasimha Rao and V P Singh, who could be the \"interim successor\" and \"likely candidates\" in case of sudden exit by Rajiv. Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991. \n \nIn a section, titled 'The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy', the report says \"In our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\" besides \"a fanatical Hindu\". \n \nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis. However, another section deals in- depth with Rajiv's mediation efforts to resolve \"the conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo...\" \n \nBesides Gandhi's possible assassination, the report also analysed various scenarios of his \"abrupt departure\" from the political scene before 1989. \"Although we believe assassination is the major near-term threat to Rajiv's tenure, any of several other events could cause his abrupt departure from the political scene before 1989,\" it said while listing out several other possibilities including \"his death from natural causes or by accident\". \n \nIt ruled out the possibility of a decision by him \"to resign out of frustration\", saying \"we see no signs of this and believe it would be out of character\". \n \nThe CIA report also noted: \"We suspect, however, that Rajiv would calculate -- as we do -- that he and his kin would be targets for extremist violence even if he left public office.\" \n \nIn a section called \"Implications for the United States\", the report says \"We believe (Rajiv) Gandhi's death would represent a significant blow to US interests, regardless of the circumstances of the succession.\" \"...We believe Indo-US relations could also suffer as a result of domestic political changes following Rajiv's assassination.\" \n \nThe report assessed Rajiv's policies ranging from dealing with extremists, foreign relations (including Sri Lankan Tamil issue) to promoting acquisition of selected foreign technology\" among others, and their outcome. \"Although some of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's policies will continue to encounter serious resistance over the next several years, we believe his dominance of the Indian political scene is secure until at least the end of his present term of office in December 1989, barring his incapacitation or death,\" it said. \n \nThe report also dealt with the possibility of a \"national government\" taking over in case of a sudden exit by Rajiv, while discounting the possibility of a military coup in such a scenario. Several portions of the 23-page report were deleted before the CIA decided to release it under the Freedom of Information Act.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sri Lanka news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"}],"title":"CIA releases report assessing Rajiv Gandhi's assassination 5 years before he was killed","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"DNA India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659516","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1346"},"name":"DNA India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202889898","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://static.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/third/public/2017/01/29/543332-15th-october-1985-indian-prime-minister-rajiv-gandhi-gettyimages.jpg?itok=5a44mBN7"}],"video":[]}}

Talk to reporters. \n  \nWith that, Patty and Jerry Wetterling laid out their secret to dealing with the media in the 27 years between when their son, Jacob, disappeared and his remains were found last fall in one of the country's must publicized child disappearances. \n  \nThe couple credited the media, especially newspapers, with helping solve their son's case. Patty Wetterling said that investigators found going through newspaper archives at the Paynesville Press especially helpful. \n \n\"I doubt they are going to have tweet archives,\" Wetterling said. \"They don't pay attention to the accuracy and the details.\" \n \nLooking at hundreds of newspaper workers on Friday, Jan. 27, during the 150th annual Minnesota Newspaper Association convention, she added: \"We have been blessed with attention to detail and accuracy.\" S \n \nhe urged newspaper officials to keep paper records. \n \n\"I want to echo a thank you for all of the work you and your colleagues do out there in the trenches,\"Jerry Wetterling said. \n \nA key to solving the case came after men who were victims of other crimes when they were young came forward and said they thought their abuser sounded like the same one who eventually became known as Jacob Wetterling's kidnapper, according to publisher and editor Michael Jacobson of the Paynesville Press. \n \nInvestigators went through the newspaper's archives, finding other crimes they linked to Danny Heinrich, who long had been a suspect in another case. The Press and other Minnesota newspapers investigated the Wetterling case, and Jacobson said he doubts it would have been solved without media attention. \n \nHowever, Jacobson said, he does not pat himself on the back. \"We all look at what we could have done better.\" \n \nJacob Wetterling, from St. Joseph, Minn., disappeared near his home on Oct. 22, 1989. He was 11 years old. The abduction remained a mystery until last year. In the meantime Patty Wetterling, in particular, became a face of a movement to prevent child kidnapping and to find missing children. \n \nLast summer, during eight days of what the Wetterlings described as intense behind-the-scene efforts, the boy's remains were found on Sept. 1 near Paynesville. \n \nA few days later, Heinrich confessed to the kidnapping. Patty Wetterling said that bones found one day were tested and found to have come from an animal. Another trip by investigators to the site Heinrich said he buried the body revealed the boy's bones and jacket. \n \nPatty Wetterling said parents need to make sure their boys do not grow up into men who abuse youths. \n \n\"We need men to grow up and say, 'We don't do this here.'\" \n \nShe also said that people should not live in fear of abductions. \n \n\"You are more likely to get hit by lightning than be abducted.\" \n \nTo the newspaper crowd, she had nothing but praise. \"You are the truth tellers,\" she said. \n \nJerry Wetterling said he could recall of just one bad experience with the media. That was when CBS Morning News conducted what he called a thorough hour-long interview, with good questions, but just a single short soundbite ended up on the air. \n \nPatty Wetterling said the Minnesota media did well. \n \n\"You were respectful,\" she said. \"You were honest. You have a high bar here. I will continue to scream about that. We need you. We needed you.

The former are mostly in retail,\" Patrick Iber, an assistant professor of history at the University of Texas at El Paso, told Business Insider.\n\n\"If you look at a map of El Paso, there is a neighborhood called Chihuahuita right across the main bridge crossing between here and Juárez,\" in Mexico, Iber said. \"And lots of relatively poor people [from Mexico] ... shop in the downscale wholesale markets that line the streets there.\"\n\nThe peso's struggles, rising nearly 13% against the dollar since the beginning of November, have negatively affected the purchasing power of Mexicans shopping in the US, in turn putting a chill on outlets on the US side of the border that cater to them.\n\n\"These are the places that I have heard are failing,\" Iber said of the markets in Chihuahuita, \"because they depend on the small amounts of disposal income among relatively poor Mexican shoppers.\"\n\nBut the Mexican consumption in El Paso and Texas more broadly is not limited to people shopping at stalls within walking distance of the border. 30 PHOTOS Where the wall already exists along the US-Mexico border See Gallery Where the wall already exists along the US-Mexico border A gap in the U.S.-Mexico border fence is seen outside Jacumba, California, United States, October 7, 2016.

Trump's hardline position on deportation and border enforcement has sent a chill throughout the immigrant community in the US, particularly in Texas.\n\n\"Even at UTEP, something like 6% of our student body crosses the Juárez bridge daily to attend school,\" Iber said. With Trump's move toward a more aggressive deportation policy that, according to one immigration lawyer, gives the administration \"carte blanche\" to round up immigrants in the US, \"People are naturally, and rightly worried,\" Iber added.\n\n\"One graduate student saw an El Paso lawyer tweet that even if you have a legal visa, don't cross the border after 6pm because border patrol agents were confiscating visas,\" Iber told Business Insider.\n\n\"I can't confirm that, but people hear those kinds of rumors (which may well be true), and it threatens the legal crossings that take place by the thousands every day. Families with relatives on both sides will be afraid to visit each other.\"\n\nThe business community in Texas, which went to Trump in the election by nearly a million votes, has also blanched at the president's apparent efforts to redo or even scrap the NAFTA trade deal that has powered US-Mexico commerce for more than 20 years.\n\nIn June 2016, at a private fundraiser for Trump, Dennis Nixon, a banker in Laredo, Texas, and one the event's hosts, sent a message to the then presidential candidate during his introduction.\n\n\"Mr. Trump, we must support trade, but I agree we need fair trade ... And here in South Texas, NAFTA meets the definition,\" Nixon said, according to The Texas Tribune. 16 PHOTOS Touching scenes from the US-Mexico border See Gallery Touching scenes from the US-Mexico border Martha Morales and Juan Manuel Gonzalez Camacho hug their grandaughter Aileen Gonalez and son Adrian Gonalez Morales as they are allowed to meet after a door is opened along the United States-Mexico Border wall during Opening the Door Of Hope/Abriendo La Puerta De La Esparana at Friendship Park in San Ysidro, California on Saturday, November 19, 2016.\n\n(SANDY HUFFAKER/AFP/) U.S. Border patrol agents stand at an open gate on the fence along the Mexico border to allow Adrian Gonzalez-Morales and his daughter Aileen hug his parents Juan and Martha, as part of Universal Children's Day at the Border Field State Park, California, U.S., November 19, 2016.\n\n(REUTERS/Mike Blake) U.S. Border patrol agents stand at an open gate on the fence along the Mexico border to allow Luis Eduardo Hernandez-Bautista hug Ty'Jahnae Williams and his father Eduardo Hernandez (not in view), as part of Universal Children's Day at the Border Field State Park, California, U.S., November 19, 2016.

They will push this agenda,\" Hollifield said. \"You will see a powerful binational coalition forming between these two countries.\"\n\nIndeed, Mexico is the US's second-largest export market and third-largest overall trade partner. In 2015, daily bilateral trade was worth $1.46 billion.\n\nTexas' imports from Mexico were worth more than $84 billion in 2015, more than double the value of imports from the state's second-biggest source, China, and more than five times the value of Texas' imports from Canada.\n\nBased on the value of 2015's imports, Texas would pay $16.8 billion more for the same goods and services if the 20% import tariff floated by the Trump administration this week were applied.\n\nThe administration quickly walked that proposal back, saying it was just an example of a plan to fund construction of Trump's vaunted border wall, but many were quick to note the deleterious impact it would have on consumers in the US.\n\n\"A 20% tax on Mex.imports to pay 4 the #BorderWall wud hav the same impact as a category 5 hurricane on the [Rio Grande Valley]~catastrophic&hard 2 overcome,\" tweeted Reuben O. Villarreal, a Republican and former mayor of Rio Grande City, which is on the Texas-Mexico border.\n\n\"We don't produce vegetables here in the states\" in the winter, said Alfredo Duarte, president and cofounder of Taxco Produce Inc., which is based in Dallas.\n\n\"We have to import vegetables,\" Duarte added. \"If people are still wanting to eat guacamole on Super Bowl day, we'll just go back to the time when we were paying $80 a case for avocados from California about 15 years ago.\"\n\nA case, which can contain 30 to 60 avocados, currently costs about $40, according to The Morning News.\n\n\"Texas' working families and our economy depend on a strong relationship with Mexico,\" saidTexas Democratic Party executive director Crystal Perkins. \"Minority President Donald Trump's 20-percent tax will kill Texas jobs, raise the price of goods for Texas families, and slaughter Texas' relationship with its largest trading partner.\"\n\nTrump's ultimate trade policy, and what the final form his border wall will be, are still up in the air. But his aggressive posture toward the intimate relationships \u2014 both commercial and familial \u2014 that have formed along the US-Mexico border has already been felt.\n\n\"I don't know that we've ever felt safe again,\" Francisca Jimenez, a cleaning woman in Ciudad Juarez, told The Morning News in December. \"There's also more uncertainty for Mexicans here in and in the United States with the arrival of el señor Trump.\"\n\n\"If Trump does what he has said he will do, it is going to affect us,\" truck driver Roman Diaz, 45, told AFP in January, while waiting to cross into California from Tijuana.\n\nMexican truckers wait years to get permits to cross into the US, joining the flow of 400,000 vehicles and a million people who cross the border into the US every day.\n\n\"We won't be able to cross any more,\" Diaz said. \"This job of ours will be over. The uncertainty is unbearable.\"\n\n\"The total impact of all this is hard to gauge at the moment, because it depends a great deal on how these threats are implemented,\" Iber told Business Insider of the consequences of Trump's border policies.\n\n\"At the moment, net migration with Mexico is near zero. But if Trump's policies force Mexico into a depression, we're likely to get more undocumented immigration to the U.S., not less,\" he added. \"It's a complex equilibrium at the moment, full of injustices, that Trump seems determined to make worse.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Christopher Woody"},"topics":[{"name":"San Diego news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Mexico news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Civilians already feeling effect of border controversy","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"AOL.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170685230","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"14"},"name":"AOL.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.aol.com","publisher":"AOL"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.businessinsider.com/mexican-central-bank-chief-trump-horror-movie-2016-12","http://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/USD-MXN","http://www.dallasnews.com/news/mexico/2016/12/28/shoppers-mexico-boost-holiday-profits-texas-border-retailers","http://www.businessinsider.com/mexican-response-backlash-to-trumps-wall-and-president-2017-1","http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-order-views-most-undocumented-immigrants-as-deportation-priorities_us_588a8ac6e4b0cef5cf871b02","http://www.politico.com/2016-election/results/map/president/texas/","https://www.texastribune.org/2016/06/18/at-fundraiser-trump-is-prodded-on-immigration-trad/","http://www.dallasnews.com/news/mexico/2016/12/30/texas-mexico-business-leaders-plan-convince-trump-cross-border-trade-good-countries","http://www.as-coa.org/articles/infographic-us-mexico-ties-numbers","https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/state/data/imports/tx.html#ctry","http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2017/01/26/trumps-20-percent-tax-mexican-imports-force-us-consumers-pay-wall","https://twitter.com/RubenV4U/status/824748427422605312","http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-mexicos-cross-border-workers-fear-trumps-wall-2017-1","http://www.businessinsider.com/mexico-president-nieto-reacts-donald-trump-executive-order-border-wall-2017-1","http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-border-wall-deportation-immigration-plans-backfire-failure-2017-1?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=aol","http://www.businessinsider.com/mexican-response-backlash-to-trumps-wall-and-president-2017-1?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=aol","http://www.businessinsider.com/mexican-designers-trumps-border-wall-cost-2017-1?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=aol"],"sequenceId":"695202893430","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

However, permission had been sought only for 3000-5000 people. \n \nFollowing the incident, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minster Akhilesh Yadav had constituted a one-man inquiry commission to probe the stampede. \n \nJustice (Retd) Chauhan had summoned nearly 42 officials, who were on duty the day the incident occurred to record their statements. \n \nThe commission had earlier this month visited Varanasi between January 3 to 6 to probe the stampede incident and completed its first round of inquiry with recording statements of over 100 people, including eyewitnesses and organisers. \n \nHowever, Chauhan while talking to mediapersons here has said that so far only one official from Chandauli district had appeared before the commission to record his statement and no other officials turned up before the commission to record their statements. \n \nHe said that due to being engaged in the Assembly election duties, most of the officials had requested to extend the dates for appearing before the commission (to record their statements), to which the commission had given them one more chance and it will be returning again to Varanasi for holding its third round of inquiry. \n \nChauhan said the commission may extend its date of probe for nearly six more months and it is likely to return again on February 20, for its third round of inquiry. \n \nHe made an appeal to the people including mediapersons that if they had any video footages or photographs taken at the time of the incident, then they may provide it to the commission. \n \n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Varanasi stampede: Commission begins second round of inquiry","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"DNA India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659516","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1346"},"name":"DNA India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202893598","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:07:14Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

These rates are paid by the business that either owns or leases a commercial building.\n\nThey are calculated using a multiplier \u2013 set by the council \u2013 to a value for the property determined by the Commissioner of Valuation.\n\nBusinesses can appeal the valuation to an independent tribunal, which they can also appeal to the high court, however this process doesn\u2019t affect the council\u2019s multiplier \u2013 which is set as part of the authority\u2019s voted budget.\n\nGoing up \n\nDublin City Council\n\nAs part of its approved budget for 2017, elected members of Dublin City Council (DCC) voted to increase commercial rates by 0.78% in a move to help address the council\u2019s budget shortfall.\n\nLast year, TheJournal.ie reported that DCC was facing a \u20ac15 million budget deficit and an increase in commercial rates was mooted to help balance the books.\n\nThe budget noted:\n\nThis is the first rate increase to commercial property rates by DCC councillors since 2009 and changes are effective of the January 2017.\n\nDún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council\n\nIn its annual budget for 2017, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council also opted to increase commercial rates this year.\n\nThe council said it needed to fund additional services and counteract extra costs in 2017, which led to a 1.5% increase in commercial rates.\n\nIt said \u201call available options were examined\u201d when trying to meet the need for a bigger budget.\n\nThe council also noted that commercial rates had previously gone down by 8.5% since 2010. This reduction in rates has resulted in a \u20ac5 million decrease in its revenue from commercial rates.\n\nHowever, in a bid to offset the burden of the increase on small businesses, an SME Support Grant has also been created.\n\nUnder the scheme, businesses with rates bills below \u20ac10,000 per year will be able to shave 4% off the amount due. This group represents 72% of all businesses in the council area.\n\nDLR County Council income \n\nCork City Council \n\nThe council has increased its commercial rates by 1.25% for 2017.\n\nThe rate hike is the first increase in eight years and is lower than the 2.9% increase originally put forward by council staff.\n\nThe hike was approved by the city council to help offset its funding shortfall for the new year.\n\nAccording to a spokeswoman for Cork City Council, the increase in commercial rates would address half the authority\u2019s \u20ac1.6 million funding deficit.\n\nCork City Council income \n\nThe rest of the shortfall will be made up in higher car parking fees and reduced spending on tourism promotion and housing.\n\nA rates incentive scheme to address commercial rates arrears has also been introduced by the council. Ratepayers that have an annual rate liability below \u20ac4,000 and pay on time are entitled to a 3% reduction on their 2018 fee.\n\nLimerick City and County Council\n\nFor 2017, the Limerick council has approved a 5% hike in commercial rates for businesses in both the city and county.\n\nThe increase was brought about after a big drop in commercial rates income over the past few years. This year, the council is expecting just over \u20ac51.6 million from rates \u2013 \u20ac7.65 million less than it was taking in during 2011.\n\nExcluding Housing Assistance Payments (HAP), roughly one-third of all income for the local authority comes from commercial rates.\n\nLimerick City and County Council income \n\nThe council has also in place a SME rebate scheme to help smaller businesses to pay the rate.\n\nUnder the plan, businesses paying \u20ac20,000 or less in rates would be entitled to rebates of up to 9%. This accounted for around 90% of the rated properties in the council area, it claimed.\n\nThe council employs a separate scheme for tourism businesses that provides a 4% rebate for the firms whose rate charges are higher than the SME-related cap.\n\nNo increases \n\nHowever not all councils covering metropolitan areas plan to hike their commercial rates this year, with both Fingal and south Dublin councils deciding against increases.\n\nFingal County Council has the lowest rate factor of all four Dublin local authorities, while it also has the highest compliance rate in the country for commercial rates at over 96% in 2015.\n\nWaterford and Cork County councils are also not increasing commercial rates for 2017.\n\nUp and down \n\nDue to a lack of parity between the rates for Galway City and County Council and Ballinasloe Town Council, rates cannot be increased in the county until Ballinsloe\u2019s rate has been brought in line. This year, both councils have committed to bridge the gap by 50%.\n\nSimilarly, Louth County Council is currently amending its commercial fees system to move towards a common rate for the region.\n\nRates for businesses in both Dundalk and Drogheda have been reduced for 2017, while commercial levies are rising for those firms based outside the two hubs.\n\nWritten by Killian Woods and posted on Fora.ie Take me to Fora","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Ireland news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"These are all the Irish cities that are hiking business rates this year","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"IE","country":"Ireland"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"TheJournal.ie","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"175383370","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"286"},"name":"TheJournal.ie","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thejournal.ie"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://fora.ie/"],"sequenceId":"695202896130","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://img2.thejournal.ie/article/3202116/river/?height=400&version=3196500"}],"video":[]}}

It quickly became Sacramento\u2019s premier shopping destination, as brands and shoppers flocked from languishing competitors. \n\nToday, Arden Fair faces challenges from both traditional brick-and-mortar outlets  \u2013  mainly the Westfield Galleria in Roseville \u2013 and the rise of online shopping. \n\nAs the region\u2019s population moved to the suburbs over the past decade, a new generation of shopping complexes \u2013 like Fountains in Roseville and Palladio at Broadstone in Folsom \u2013 have gained traction. \n\nArden Fair mall\u2019s sales tax revenue has fallen from $5.1 million in 2006 to $4.5 million in 2015, according to the city of Sacramento. The Galleria\u2019s tax revenue surged from $3.6 million in 2006 to $4.5 million in 2015, according to the city of Roseville. \n\nArden Fair in recent years has experienced rising vacancy and has lost significant national brands. Cold Stone Creamery recently shuttered its food court ice cream shop. Maggiano\u2019s Little Italy last year closed its high-profile restaurant because revenue came in 40 percent below expectations. The spot remains vacant. \n\nSeveral storefronts also sit empty, including a prominent location in center court and one next to Macy\u2019s. Management has tried to stem the losses by bringing in temporary tenants \u2013 viewed as less desirable \u2013 such as a massage parlor. Jamie Donley, an Arden Fair spokeswoman, declined to comment for this article. \n\nGarrick Brown, vice president of retail research for the Americas at brokerage firm Cushman & Wakefield, has witnessed firsthand the changes at the region\u2019s six malls \u2013 the others were Downtown Plaza, Country Club Plaza, Florin Mall, Sunrise Mall and the Westfield Galleria. \n\nDowntown Plaza was demolished to make way for the Golden 1 Center. Country Club Plaza on Watt Avenue and Florin Mall in south Sacramento were transformed into strip mall centers. Sunrise Mall in Citrus Heights has struggled to reinvent itself, leaving the region with essentially two players \u2013 Arden Fair and the Westfield Galleria. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen pretty much everyone going backward with the exception of Roseville Galleria,\u201d Brown said. \n\n\u201cCompetition in the marketplace is a big factor,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThey\u2019ve declined from a solid \u2018A-\u2019 to \u2018B\u2019 as far as report cards go.\u201d \n\nBrown, who completed a walk-through of the region\u2019s malls late last year, estimated that Arden Fair had a 5.5 percent vacancy rate. That number has likely risen, with recent departures by pop-up tenants such as the Sacramento Kings team store and a Christmas-themed novelty store. In comparison, Galleria and Sunrise had a vacancy rate of 3.5 and 9.5 percent, respectively, Brown said. \n\nArden also lags in another retail health-determining metric \u2013 the amount of sales made per-square-foot of shopping space. Arden Fair rang up about $485 per square foot last year, compared with $621 at the Galleria and $375 at Sunrise, according to Cushman & Wakefield. \n\nArden commanded $600 a square foot in 2005, Brown said. Sales tax revenue has also fallen steadily, from $5.1 million in 2006 to $4.5 million in 2015, according to the city of Sacramento. Meanwhile, the Galleria\u2019s tax revenue surged from $3.6 million in 2006 to $4.5 million in 2015, according to the city of Roseville. \n\nWe\u2019ve seen pretty much everyone going backward with the exception of Roseville (Westfield) Galleria. \n\nGarrick Brown, vice president of retail research for the Americas at brokerage firm Cushman & Wakefield \n\nThe departure of merchants and especially well-known brands can brew a vicious cycle. Vacant storefronts and the lack of a strong tenant base are considered red flags among existing merchants and those seeking to open another location. For instance, Arden Fair lost fashion design house Kate Spade in 2010. But when the New York brand decided to return to the region in 2015, it made a beeline for the Galleria. \n\n\u201cNational retailers have very sophisticated real estate arms. They know what the score is when it comes to a particular property,\u201d said Edward Dittmer, a vice president at Morningstar Credit Ratings, which tracks bonds issued by malls. \n\nThe consolidation of the retail industry leaves malls with more empty space as brands go bankrupt. Malls are getting creative, such as building entertainment venues and bringing in restaurants or personal services. Downtown Plaza, for instance, experimented with tenants as varied as the U.S. Postal Service and the Golden 1 Credit Union. \n\nThe tenant mix of malls is crucial to retaining customer loyalty. Victoria Chavez, 19, of North Highlands, said she stopped visiting Sunrise mall after it lost American Eagle Outfitters. \n\n\u201cThe Galleria is far away, but the variety of stores is 100 percent better than Arden Fair,\u201d Chavez said. \n\nBrown of Cushman & Wakefield noted that the Westfield Galleria is surrounded by an area with a higher income demographic compared with Arden Fair, which is \u201cmuch more attractive to retailers.\u201d \n\n\u201cIf the income demographics in your trade area are waning, there\u2019s not much you can do,\u201d Brown said of Arden Fair. \n\nCompetition from strip malls, \u201clifestyle centers\u201d and stand-alone big-box stores is also hurting Arden Fair. Consumers gravitate toward lifestyle centers \u2013 such as the Fountains in Roseville and the Palladio at Broadstone in Folsom \u2013 due to the variety of tenants, from restaurants to grocery chains and apparel boutiques. \n\nThe Fountains generated almost $1 million in sales tax revenue in 2015, up from $93,000 in 2005, according to city data. The Fountains, which calls itself a \u201cunique collection of 40 stores and nine restaurants,\u201d has an open-air atmosphere and a weekly farmers market. \n\nThe popularity of lifestyle centers is evidenced by the Palladio more than doubling its sales in a short period. In 2012, the center generated nearly $300,000 in sales tax revenue, but by 2015 that amount was well over $600,000, according to the city of Folsom.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Sacramento Kings news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sacramento news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Region\u2019s traditional malls surviving, some better than others","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sacramento","zipCode":"95816","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Sacramento","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sacramento Bee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672618","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4516"},"name":"Sacramento Bee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sacbee.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202897626","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A week later, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences pledged to phase out senior members and enlist new, diverse voters who would, if all recruiting goals were met, double minority membership by 2020. \n \nTuesday morning, for the first time, three black actors were nominated in the same category, supporting actress: Viola Davis for \u201cFences,\u201d Naomie Harris for \u201cMoonlight\u201d and Octavia Spencer for \u201cHidden Figures.\u201d Denzel Washington was also nominated in the lead actor category for his performance in \u201cFences,\u201d and Mahershala Ali in the supporting actor category for \u201cMoonlight.\u201d \n \nBut Hollywood\u2019s diversity problem isn\u2019t solved. By many measures, it\u2019s still as bad as ever. And the studios\u2019 biggest minority deficit by far involves the very people living and working outside their walls in virtually every direction -- Latinos. \n \nThere were no egregious snubs for Latinos -- as expected, Lin-Manuel Miranda got a nod for original song for \u201cMoana\u201d -- but that\u2019s only because there were so very few roles for us to begin with. Though the Mexican auteur Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu won the Oscar for director in 2015 and 2016, and his countryman Alfonso Cuaron took home the same award in 2014, the two directors are elite aberrations. \n \nIn a report published last year, USC found that Latinos got only 5 percent of speaking roles in the top-grossing 100 films released in 2015. The glaring absence extends to television. UCLA\u2019s 2016 Hollywood Diversity Report found that Latinos were the most underrepresented group in TV for the second year in a row. The previous year, UCLA\u2019s annual report found that Latinos got only 2 percent of the roles in scripted broadcast TV, while Asians got 4 percent and black characters were \u201coverrepresented.\u201d According to the report\u2019s longtime author, Darnell Hunt, Hollywood has actually been losing ground with minorities because the Latino population\u2019s growth is outpacing the industry\u2019s reluctant attempts to diversify. \n \nEven when rare lead roles are scripted for Latino characters, they are often filled by non-Latino actors. Ben Affleck played the Mexican American CIA operative Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Mendez in the 2012 film \u201cArgo,\u201d and Jon Favreau played the Cuban entrepreneur behind the \u201cEl Jefe\u201d food truck in his 2014 film \u201cChef.\u201d More recently, the British actor Charlie Hunnam, best known for his role in TV\u2019s \u201cSons of Anarchy,\u201d was criticized for taking the role of a Mexican American narco-boss in the upcoming feature \u201cAmerican Drug Lord.\u201d \n \nThe dearth of Latino storytelling and overlooking of Latino talent is especially remarkable when you consider that about 3 out of 4 people in Los Angeles County are minorities, and about half of them are Latino, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Latinos surpassed whites as the largest ethnic or racial group in California in 2015, and we make up nearly 1 out of 5 Americans. We also accounted for almost 1 out of every 4 tickets purchased by frequent moviegoers in 2015, according to the Motion Picture Association of America. In the same year, more Latinos headed to theaters regularly than African-Americans and Asians combined. \n \nFor these reasons, the African-American activist Najee Ali is bringing back the boycott this year, but with a focus on Latinos. In a telephone interview, he called the industry\u2019s snubbing of Latinos \u201cdisturbing.\u201d In another interview, Alex Nogales, chief executive of the National Hispanic Media Coalition and a longtime advocate for diversity in film and TV, told me that his group will be joining criticism of the Academy. \n \n\u201cYes, they\u2019ve done better with African-Americans,\u201d he said, \u201cbut diversity is about more than just one group. We\u2019re being ignored.\u201d \n \nNogales was echoing a sentiment expressed by the actor America Ferrera in a column for Deadline last year. \u201cAt a certain point, it becomes unavoidable to notice that we\u2019re being ignored,\u201d Ferrera said. In a scathing piece for the Hollywood Reporter in 2014, Chris Rock argued that the industry sees Latinos only as a service class. \u201cForget whether Hollywood is black enough,\u201d Rock wrote. \u201cA better question is: Is Hollywood Mexican enough? You\u2019re in LA, you\u2019ve got to try not to hire Mexicans.\u201d \n \nElyce Helford, director of Jewish and Holocaust studies at Middle Tennessee State University, has argued that Hollywood\u2019s Jewish founders established a lily-white vision of America because they feared anti-Semitism and wanted to stave off any suspicions or accusations that their values were un-American. A similar fear has led some of Hollywood\u2019s most celebrated Latino talents, including Rita Hayworth, to adopt professional names that belie their south-of-the-border heritage. \n \nThis year brings an added concern -- that an industry that has long portrayed Latinos as banditos, gangsters, and busboys will serve to fuel the racism and hatred generated by a divisive election in which the winning candidate attempted to brand Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists. If there\u2019s hope that Latinos will ever been seen as three-dimensional, assimilated, and American, it can be found just outside the studio gates. \n  \nDennis Romero, staff writer for the LA Weekly, wrote this for the Los Angeles Times.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":""},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Latino news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Hollywood less white, but Latinos still overlooked","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rock Island","zipCode":"61265","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Moline","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Quad-Cities Online","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169681602","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"221"},"name":"Quad-Cities Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.qconline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202908393","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:18Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The PPV is scheduled to take place at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas. \n  \nRoyal Rumble 2017 poster (Image courtesy: WWE Twitter) \n  \nThe live streaming will take place on the WWE Network exclusively on a subscription basis. However, the live streaming will be available on Ten 2 Network in India from 5.30 AM onwards with the pre-show at 3.30 AM (Jan 30th). \n \nThe repeat telecast will take place on Ten 1 at 6 PM, tomorrow (Jan 30th) and 9 PM on Wednesday (Feb 1st). \n \nThis is what we can expect to go down in this year\u2019s edition of Royal Rumble. \n \nThe Universal championship match will take place between Roman Reigns and Kevin Owens with Chris Jericho hanging in the shark cage above the ring. \n \nSince the difference-maker will be out of the equation, we can expect Reigns to win the championship, finally. \n \nThe chances are even higher as it\u2019s the Wrestlemania season and the top babyface of the company should carry the belt on his shoulder. \n \nSame can be said for the WWE championship, as well since the franchise John Cena\u2019s chances are high to capture his 16th world championship gold. \n \nHe is expected to finally seek his revenge on AJ Styles to settle the score and win the gold to go forward to Wrestlemania. \n \nFrom the Raw women\u2019s division, Charlotte will be defending her title against Bayley. Although the hugger is looking confident to win his first major gold, the PPV-queen will not let her do so. \n \nShe will retain to throwing some shenanigans to set up even a bigger bout between them at Wrestlemania. \n \nOn the other hand, there will be a six-woman tag team match from Smackdown. The team of Nikki, Becky and Naomi will take on the team of Natalya, Mickie James, and Alexa Bliss. \n \nThe babyface team should pick up the win to give us a feel-good moment. This will further set up singles encounters between them at the Elimination Chamber PPV. \n \nRich Swann will be defending his Cruiserweight title against Neville. This new Neville turned out to be vicious for everybody in the division. \n \nThis might be the time that he would pick up the title around her waist to solidify himself as the King of Cruiserweights. \n \nIn the main event, the Rumble match is unpredictable comparing the last few years. Bigger names will be seen, this year to make it worth a watch. \n \nUndertaker is the favorite to win it, this year since he is inserted into the match with a motive to set up his bout against John Cena or Roman reigns at Wrestlemania. \n \nChris Jericho stands the chance to win as well if Owens retains the Universal championship. Goldberg is the third favorite to win it to set up the main event between him and Reigns. \n \nApart from the winners, there might be some short segments to culminate more matches in future. The Wyatt family members should cost each other the spots to start an Orton Vs Wyatt bout for Wrestlemania. The New Day is also expected to do the same planting the seeds of their separation. \n \nBraun Strowman might eliminate Big Show to start their rivalry. Furthermore, Goldberg and Brock Lesnar might cost each other\u2019s spots to finalize their third encounter at Wrestlemania. \n \nAs for surprises, we can expect names like Kurt Angle, Finn Balor, Kenny Omega, Rey Mysterio etc. \n \nOneIndia News","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"WWE Royal Rumble 2017: Preview, prediction and schedule","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Oneindia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667805","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"54"},"name":"Oneindia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.oneindia.in/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.oneindia.com/topic/wwe"],"sequenceId":"695202909498","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:09:33Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.oneindia.com/img/2017/01/c25-wt-uaaarjme-29-1485676024.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 51 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Monterey","zipCode":"93901","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Salinas","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"KSBW Channel.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659148","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"50"},"name":"KSBW Channel.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ksbw.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202912142","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

You won\u2019t find me anywhere near a Trump golf course. And I won\u2019t be checking into any Trump Hotels, no matter how many times the president notes that they\u2019re \u201cgorgeous.\u201d \n \nI\u2019m in good company. But other people are taking their economic protest far beyond the businesses that bear the new president\u2019s name. \n \nTake a look at the Boycott Trump app, which claims to be \u201cthe first app of its kind, allowing users to hit Trump where it hurts most -- his wallet.\u201d It lists companies such as 7-Up, which is connected to Trump only because it sponsored \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d in 2011; Amazon, which sells Trump\u2019s brand of menswear; and Gucci, which rents retail space in Trump Tower. Hundreds of companies are implicated, many due to their CEOs\u2019 supportive comments or campaign donations. A competing app called Boycott Trump Businesses sorts the offending businesses into categories (Trump-owned, Trump tenants, campaign supporters, friends and associates) but is just as broad. \n \nIn a way, boycotts are the perfect protest mechanism for this particular president. Trump was elected without a majority of votes and, if you still trust opinion polls, has historically low approval ratings -- in other words, most of us wish he weren\u2019t the president. He cites his business acumen as his primary qualification for office and has refused to divest himself to avoid conflicts of interest. What better time to call on the power of the purse? \n \nBut I\u2019m skeptical that a wide-ranging, multi-target boycott effort will have the intended effect -- assuming the intended effect is punishing Trump and the people who want to realize his agenda, rather than merely assuaging the consciences of those doing the boycotting. \n \nWhen there are hundreds of businesses on the no-buy list, that dilutes the political message, and there\u2019s a smaller chance that any one company will be hurt by its inclusion. \n \nHistorically, boycotts aimed to change a company\u2019s policy. Collective withdrawal of financial support led to the integration of the bus system in Alabama in the 1960s and improved working conditions for grape-picking farm workers in the 1980s. There are also some modern examples of this style of activism: A three-year boycott of Driscoll\u2019s berries ended in November when the company agreed to allow workers to unionize. \n \nYet boycotts these days are often more nebulous. In 2012, for instance, LGBT rights supporters refused to eat at the restaurant chain Chick-fil-A not because of labor conditions or factory farming or any of the usual suspects, but because its CEO spoke out against marriage equality. And when boycott campaigns are oriented around words -- or beliefs -- rather than specific actions, it becomes much harder to track results or declare victory. The Chick-fil-A CEO later said it was a mistake to link his personal views with his business, but he\u2019s still in charge of the company, which is still posting profits. \n \nToo often, consumers are just trying to register their displeasure, which is certainly their right. But they don\u2019t stop to ask themselves a basic question: What, exactly, do they want their boycott to accomplish? In the case of Chick-fil-A, did the boycotters want to silence the CEO, force a change in leadership, or get the CEO to change his mind? That was never clear. \n \nBoycotts, especially boycotts untethered to specific company policies, may also have unintended consequences. To counter the Chick-fil-A protest, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas promoted a Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day. In 2015, after Trump said that Mexican immigrants were rapists, Macy\u2019s stopped carrying his menswear line. (It still carries his daughter\u2019s brand, and is listed on the Boycott Trump app.) Trump tweeted calls to boycott Macy\u2019s as a result. Since then, the department store has had seven straight quarters of declining sales. \n \n\u201cWe are going through a challenging period in our industry, so (Trump\u2019s tweets) certainly didn\u2019t help but it\u2019s hard to pinpoint if it had any impact,\u201d the former CEO told Fortune. \n \nLike many people who were politically energized by the outcome of the election, I\u2019ve had to look at my actions and think about where I can effect real change. I don\u2019t want to yell into the wind to make myself feel better; I want tangible results. So while I may avoid shopping at companies whose CEOs have said they support Trump, I probably won\u2019t check to make sure every place I spend my money is ideologically pure. I\u2019ll only actively participate in a boycott if it\u2019s connected to a desired policy change. And I\u2019ll make a point of writing to the company to demand that specific outcome. \n \nThat said, I wouldn\u2019t shop at a Trump-branded business even if the president were to fully divest himself. If that\u2019s an example of making myself feel better, so be it. There are exceptions to every rule. \n  \nAnn Friedman is a contributing writer to the Los Angeles Times\u2019 opinion section.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ann Friedman"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Boycotting everything will accomplish nothing","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rock Island","zipCode":"61265","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Moline","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Quad-Cities Online","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169681602","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"221"},"name":"Quad-Cities Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.qconline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202912707","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:14Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She hates the books in your library. She hates all your material possessions that look older or those that ruin the shape of \u2018her\u2019 house. You recently found her unpacking your campus suitcase that you have moved with through six houses in the last few decades without unpacking and she wanted to throw away everything, saying nothing was relevant. \n \nShe couldn\u2019t understand the sentimental attachment to the pictures you took while in campus, the cards from your exes, lecture notes that you valued and thought wise enough to be kept for posterity, and old trophies that you won while playing in the campus soccer team.

Angelelli is about a minute ahead of Renger van der Zande, who is driving the No. 90 Riley for VisitFlorida Racing. \n\nIf Angelelli and his teammates can stay there, they would clinch a victory in Gordon's first Rolex 24 race in a decade and give Angelelli a win in his final race. Angelelli is retiring as a full-time driver and focusing on co-owning the team and running the Cadillac program. \n\nOther class leaders at the halfway mark: Joey Hand in the No. 66 Ford in the GT Le Mans class; Nicholas Boulle in the No. 38 Oreca in the Prototype Challenge class; and Jeff Segel in the No. 86 Acura in the GT Daytona class. \n\n--- \n\n12:30 a.m. \n\nThe Tequila Patron team has reason for some late-night shots. \n\nBrendon Hartley, driving on cold tires, turned into a Porsche driven by Wolf Henzler and crashed hard into the outside wall at Daytona International Speedway with about 14 hours to go in the Rolex 24 race early Sunday. Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season.

The \u201csanitised\u201d report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). \n \nThe report, whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986. \n \nThe very first sentence of the report\u2019s available (undeleted) page reads: \u201cPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\u201d It, however, later clearly said that \u201cassassination is the major near-term threat\u201d to him. \n \nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991. \n \nThe first section titled \u201cKey Judgments\u201d analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India\u2019s relations with the US, the then USSR and the region. \n \nThreats \n \nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi\u2019s life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder. \n \n\u201cIf Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures \u2014 including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India \u2014 were taken by the Indian President ...... (deleted),\u201d it said. \n \nInterestingly, it also names P.V. Narasimha Rao and V.P. Singh, who could be the \u201cinterim successor\u201d and \u201clikely candidates\u201d in case of sudden exit by Rajiv. Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991. \n \nIn a section, titled \u2018The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy\u2019, the report says \u201cIn our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\u201d besides \u201ca fanatical Hindu\u201d. \n \nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis. However, another section deals in-depth with Rajiv\u2019s mediation efforts to resolve \u201cthe conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo...\u201d \n \nGandhi's departure \n \nBesides Gandhi\u2019s possible assassination, the report also analysed various scenarios of his \u201cabrupt departure\u201d from the political scene before 1989. \n \n\u201cAlthough we believe assassination is the major near-term threat to Rajiv\u2019s tenure, any of several other events could cause his abrupt departure from the political scene before 1989,\u201d it said while listing out several other possibilities including \u201chis death from natural causes or by accident\u201c. \n \nIt ruled out the possibility of a decision by him \u201cto resign out of frustration\u201d, saying \u201cwe see no signs of this and believe it would be out of character\u201c. \n \nThe CIA report also noted: \u201cWe suspect, however, that Rajiv would calculate \u2014 as we do \u2014 that he and his kin would be targets for extremist violence even if he left public office.\u201d \n \nIn a section called \u201cImplications for the United States\u201d, the report says \u201cWe believe (Rajiv) Gandhi\u2019s death would represent a significant blow to US interests, regardless of the circumstances of the succession.\u201d \n \n\u201d...We believe Indo-US relations could also suffer as a result of domestic political changes following Rajiv\u2019s assassination.\u201d \n \nThe report assessed Rajiv\u2019s policies ranging from dealing with extremists, foreign relations (including Sri Lankan Tamil issue) to promoting acquisition of selected foreign technology\u201d among others, and their outcome. \n \n\u201cAlthough some of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s policies will continue to encounter serious resistance over the next several years, we believe his dominance of the Indian political scene is secure until at least the end of his present term of office in December 1989, barring his incapacitation or death,\u201d it said. \n \nThe report also dealt with the possibility of a \u201cnational government\u201d taking over in case of a sudden exit by Rajiv, while discounting the possibility of a military coup in such a scenario. \n \nSeveral portions of the 23-page report were deleted before the CIA decided to release it under the Freedom of Information Act.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sri Lanka news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"}],"title":"30mins \u2018CIA assessed Rajiv assassination 5 years before he was killed\u2019","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"The Hindu","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169592117","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"917"},"name":"The Hindu","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hindu.com","publisher":"The Hindu Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202918470","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there.

It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n--- \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n--- \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Horry","zipCode":"29578","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Myrtle Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Myrtle Beach Sun News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657695","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1140"},"name":"Myrtle Beach Sun News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202919196","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

Qantas is offering refunds to any passengers travelling from Australia to the United States who are affected by a new entry ban. Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days. That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.\n\nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.\n\nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government.\n\nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.\n\n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\"\n\nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.\n\n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said.\n\n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\"\n\nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.

Angelelli is about a minute ahead of Renger van der Zande, who is driving the No. 90 Riley for VisitFlorida Racing. \n\nIf Angelelli and his teammates can stay there, they would clinch a victory in Gordon's first Rolex 24 race in a decade and give Angelelli a win in his final race. Angelelli is retiring as a full-time driver and focusing on co-owning the team and running the Cadillac program. \n\nOther class leaders at the halfway mark: Joey Hand in the No. 66 Ford in the GT Le Mans class; Nicholas Boulle in the No. 38 Oreca in the Prototype Challenge class; and Jeff Segel in the No. 86 Acura in the GT Daytona class. \n\n--- \n\n12:30 a.m. \n\nThe Tequila Patron team has reason for some late-night shots. \n\nBrendon Hartley, driving on cold tires, turned into a Porsche driven by Wolf Henzler and crashed hard into the outside wall at Daytona International Speedway with about 14 hours to go in the Rolex 24 race early Sunday. Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year. \n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car. He turned it over to Seb Morris in third as the Cadillac teams had put all but one car in the prototype class at least a lap down. \n\n--- \n\n2:30 p.m. \n\nThe 55th running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona is underway, with pole-sitter Joao Barbosa leading the 55-car field to the green flag. \n\nThe twice-around-the-clock endurance race began under cool temperatures and cloudy skies, with a threat of steady rain predicted for later Saturday. \n\nFour-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon started the race in the pits, with Wayne Taylor Racing teammate Ricky Taylor opening behind the wheel of the No. 10 Cadillac. \n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" runner-up and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe, four-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay also are in the field. \n\nChip Ganassi Racing, which has dominated the Rolex in recent years, has two entries. One of them includes Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais, who won their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NASCAR news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The Latest: Jeff Gordon, Taylor Racing halfway home to Rolex","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Beaufort","zipCode":"29910","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bluffton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Island Packet","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659155","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1303"},"name":"Island Packet","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Gossip","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.islandpacket.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202929631","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The blaze, which happened at 11pm, caused extensive damage to a utility room. \n \nEarlier the same day - on January 18 - at 3pm firefighters attended a house fire on Roecar Close, Chesterfield. The occupant had extinguished the fire prior to the crew's arrival. \n \nThen at 10.30am firefighters attended a house fire on Holbein Close, Dronfield. No-one was injured in the incidents and all three homes had working fire alarms. \n \nArea manager Alex Johnson said: \"We have responded to three separate fires involving tumble dryers this week, but thankfully, all three properties were fitted with working smoke alarms and nobody sustained any injuries. \n READ MORE: A murderer, a sadist and an old flasher in Derby's courts  \n\"It's important that everyone takes a moment to familiarise themselves with our electrical safety advice, which can help prevent accidental fires from occurring and help protect families from the devastating consequences of a house fire.\" \n \nIt is estimated 6,000 fires have been caused by tumble dryers in the past six years - and a year ago Whirlpool said more than four million of its tumble dryers, sold under the Hotpoint, Indesit and Creda brands, were at risk of catching fire if fluff catches the heating element and customers have been advised to have modifications carried out to stop them over-heating. \n \nOne of the most notable cases was when a dryer caused a huge fire in an 18-storey London tower block in Shepherd's Bush. \n \n\n \nDerbyshire Fire and Rescue Service is reminding people of the importance of having working smoke alarms fitted on every level of the home and again have issued safety advice relating to tumble dryers and other electrical items. \n \nTumble Dryer Safety \n Always follow the manufacturer's instructions.  Don't use tumble dryers at night or while unattended.  Don't overload plug sockets.  Remove the lint from the trap after every load of clothes dried. Do not cover the vent or any other opening.  Ensure the vent pipe is free of kinks and is not crushed in any way. Only use recommended vent pipes, and not improvised ones.  Only vent the warm air to the outside of a building. Do not put rags or materials into your tumble dryer if they have been used to soak up flammable liquids.   \nFor more information on tumble dryer safety visit http://www.electricalsafetyfirst.org.uk/guides-and... \n [embedded content]  \nElectrical Safety \n  Always check that you are using the right fuse to prevent overheating.  Make sure an electrical appliance has a British or European safety mark when you buy it.  Certain appliances, such as washing machines, should have a single plug to themselves, as they are high powered.  Try and keep to one plug per socket.  Keep your eyes peeled for signs of dangerous or loose wiring such as scorch marks, hot plugs and sockets, fuses that blow or circuit-breakers that trip for no obvious reasons, or flickering lights.  Check and replace any old cables and leads, especially if they are hidden from view behind furniture or under carpets and mats.  Unplug appliances when you're not using them or when you go to bed.   \nFor more fire safety advice and information visit www.derbys-fire.gov.uk \n READ MORE: Just look what this pervert did in A&E at Royal Derby Hospital","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"England news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Tumble dryers cause three fires in Derbyshire in 24-hour period","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Derbyshire","zipCode":"DE1","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Derby","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Derby Telegraph","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659128","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Derby Telegraph","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk","publisher":"Local World"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/danger-warning-as-tumble-dryers-cause-three-fires-in-derbyshire-in-24-hour-period/story-30079713-detail/story.html#comments","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/a-killer-a-sadist-and-a-flasher-among-those-in-derby-s-courts-in-january/story-30085616-detail/story.html","http://www.electricalsafetyfirst.org.uk/guides-and-advice/electrical-items/tumble-dryers/","http://www.derbys-fire.gov.uk/","http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/pervert-jailed-after-flashing-in-a-e-department-at-royal-derby-hospital/story-30079114-detail/story.html"],"sequenceId":"695202933089","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(Photo by AFP) \n \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May has signed a £100 million warplane deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in hopes that the UK will emerge as Turkey\u2019s principal military partner. \n \nThe jet fighter agreement, signed on Saturday, will see the UK\u2019s largest military contractor BAE Systems collaborate with Turkish companies to build a custom-made Turkish warplane, the TF-X, British daily The Guardian reported, underlining that the UK hopes the deal would spark \u201ca longstanding relationship, and open the door to becoming Turkey\u2019s main defense provider.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt marks the start of a new and deeper trading relationship with Turkey and will potentially secure British and Turkish jobs and prosperity for decades to come,\u201d said May, who had earlier laid a wreath at the mausoleum of former Turkish leader Kemal Ataturk.   \n \n\u201cThis agreement underlines once again that Britain is a great, global trading nation and that we are open for business,\u201d added the British prime minister, who aims to demonstrate that the UK can strike lucrative trade deals as it prepares to exit the European Union. \n \n\u201cWe would expect this to unlock further deals,\u201d said a Downing Street spokeswoman as quoted in the report, which noted that besides the warplane deal, May and Erdogan further discussed security cooperation and counter-terrorism, and agreed to form \u201ca joint working group\u201d to begin talks about a bilateral trade deal that could be signed after Brexit. \n British Prime Minister Theresa May (R) bows her head during a wreath laying ceremony at Anitkabir, the mausoleum of Kemal Ataturk on January 28, 2017. (Photo by AFP)  \nThe development came immediately following May\u2019s official visit to Washington, where she held talks with US President Donald Trump. \n \nAccording to the report, May signed the military deal with Turkey despite growing concerns regarding Erdogan\u2019s human rights record \u201cand the increasingly authoritarian tone of his government, which has locked up thousands of political dissidents and protesters.\u201d \n  \nThe spokeswoman insisted that the issues of human rights and trade were distinct saying, \u201cI think those are separate issues; Turkey is an important NATO partner, so our cooperation on both security and defense is in line with that.\u201d \n  \n\u201cThe prime minister\u2019s approach is quite clear; she thinks it is important and in the UK\u2019s interests to engage with Turkey,\u201d she further stated. \n \nAsked about the massive crackdown following the attempted coup against Erdogan\u2019s leadership last year, May\u2019s spokeswoman said, \u201cWe have expressed strong support for Turkey\u2019s democracy and institutions following the coup, but have also been very clear that we urge Turkey\u2019s response to be proportionate and in line with international human rights obligations.\u201d \n \nSpeaking beside Erdogan in his lavish presidential office, May said, \u201cI\u2019m proud that the UK stood with you on July 15 last year in defense of democracy and now it is important that Turkey sustains that democracy by maintaining the rule of law and upholding its international human rights obligations as the government has undertaken to do.\u201d \n \nMay\u2019s remarks on human rights comes despite her total expression of support for Persian Gulf dictatorships such as Saudi Arabia and Bahrain as Britain presses ahead with more weapon sales to both regimes, which are notorious for their grave human rights records in their cruel repression of domestic dissent. ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Turkey news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"UK news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"UK, Turkey sign £100mn warplane deal 8hr","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IR","country":"Iran"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"PressTV.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552639271","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1225"},"name":"PressTV.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://presstv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202937101","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale\u2019s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\u201cThe judge\u2019s order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US \u2014 it doesn\u2019t immediately order that they be released from detention,\u201d he told CNN. \n \n\u201cWe are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\u201d he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \u201cour courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump\u2019s controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \u201conly for nationals of countries for whom\u201d members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump\u2019s order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\u201cAmerica is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump\u2019s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump\u2019s order and pledged continued action. \n \n\u201cThis should not happen in America,\u201d Velazquez said following Darweesh\u2019s release. \u201cOne by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\u201d \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\u201cBecause the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK\u2019s Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\u201cWhen Mr. Darweesh\u2019s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u2018Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\u201d the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\u201cOur courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump\u2019s order puts those who have helped us in harm\u2019s way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, titled \u201cProtection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\u201cI am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security.\u201d \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Tarrant","zipCode":"76006","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Arlington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WBAP News/Talk 820","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169707545","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"53"},"name":"WBAP News/Talk 820","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://wbap.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/ny-immigration-order-stay/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695202945097","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\u201d \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n \n\u201cThis executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \u201cPortland coffee comes from Yemen,\u201d one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n \nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \u201chashtag activist\u201d but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n \n\u201cThis was the last straw,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cWe\u2019re all immigrants.\u201d \n \nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n \nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey. \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"More protests against Trump\u2019s immigration policies planned","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Tarrant","zipCode":"76006","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Arlington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WBAP News/Talk 820","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169707545","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"53"},"name":"WBAP News/Talk 820","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://wbap.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/us-immigration-protests/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695202947909","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They're mentally tough as well. They always kept going. \n \n\"It's something that I learned from them a lot, is how to hopefully do the same, which hopefully I've been able to do.\" \n \nWilliams had been reluctant to talk about records in Melbourne to keep the pressure off, but she is now ready to acknowledge her standing as one of the greatest women players of all time, if not the greatest. \n \n\"I definitely think so. I mean, between Martina, myself, Steffi Graf, hands down we are leading that conversation,\" she said. \n \nHer achievement took 19 long years from her Grand Slam debut as a 17-year-old in Melbourne in 1998, and she is not ready to stop just yet. \n \nBut she insists there are no new goals, despite Court's 24 titles being within reach. \n \n\"I never had a number. That's the beauty of it,\" she said. \n \n\"When I started this journey, I just wanted to win a Grand Slam. Then I just wanted to win. Every time I step on the court, I want to win.\" \n \nAnd in an ominous sign that there is still more to come, she added: \"I don't want it to stop. I want to keep it going.\" \n \nEnjoy the moment \n \nBeing at the top for so long means Williams now carefully selects her tournaments, and she is set to take a break now until Indian Wells in early March. \n \nShe said she wanted to enjoy winning in Australia, and give it time to sink in. \n \n\"One thing I learned in the past is you have to enjoy it. That's the beauty of winning Australia, you have a few months to relax,\" she said. \n \n\"If you win the French, it's like back-to-back-to-back-to-back. Australia, you have time to enjoy the moment before the next Grand Slam.\" \n \nWilliams also has wedding plans to make after her recent engagement to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who was courtside for her historic victory. \n \nShe revealed that elder sister Venus would be a bridesmaid, but not when the marriage would take place nor where. \n \nBut she said it was special having Ohanian by her side in Melbourne. \n \n\"He's been so supportive in the stands.

The Premier League's star imports are demanding huge pay rises as clubs' TV revenues rocket, Chinese teams entice them with mega wages \u2013 and the pound slumps ahead of Brexit. \n \nSome players have secured bumper increases before Tuesday's transfer window deadline. \n \nLiverpool's Brazilian playmaker Philippe Coutinho has signed a five-year contract worth between £150,000 (RM834,370) and £200,000 per week. \n \nBut Arsenal have yet to meet the demands of Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez. \n \nReports suggest World Cup winner Ozil and Sanchez, twice winner of the Copa America, each want around £250,000 per week as they also factor in the cost of converting pounds into their native currencies. \n \nThis is significantly higher than their current weekly wages of about £135,000 and above Arsenal's improved offer said to be in the region of £200,000. \n \n\"While fans tend to associate player costs with transfer fees, it's important to note that transfer fees only account for around one-third of overall player costs,\" said Jake Cohen, a sports lawyer at Mills & Reeve. \n \n\"The majority of player costs go to wages,\" he said in an interview with AFP, adding that some players from abroad do in fact sign deals to be paid in currencies other than the pound. \n \nTo help offset the impact of currency fluctuations, Premier League clubs have sponsorship and other deals with foreign exchange trading groups that offer them preferential rates. \n \n\"Any company engaging in multinational transactions should be considering forex options, and football clubs are particularly exposed,\" said Cohen. \n \n\"Clubs often enter into contracts with international companies in foreign currencies, such as sponsorship deals and service contracts,\" he added. \n \nSince Britain last year voted to exit the European Union, sterling has plunged by around 18% against the dollar and some 14% versus the euro. \n \n\"The weaker pound is rapidly chipping away at players' already staggering wages and ... agents are clearly seeking to capitalise on this new opportunity to draw more out of the clubs,\" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda trading group. \n \n\"They will also be very aware of the fact that (Premier League) clubs can afford to meet the higher terms due to the new TV deals,\" Erlam told AFP. \n \n\"I don't think it's a coincidence that some footballers who clearly came to England to chase the television money are now using China to try and broker a better deal,\" he added. \n \nChina has shot into the world's top five buyers of international football talent, a Fifa report said Friday, while British media is frequently linking Premier League players with potential moves to the country. \n \nPower of TV \n \nCohen meanwhile pointed out that the falling pound would do little to help bridge a widening gap between TV incomes earned by England's top 20 clubs and the broadcasting revenues made by Europe's other top leagues, including in Spain. \n \n\"The falling pound may aid La Liga in principle, but it will take a lot more than a 10% or 15% improvement in the value of the euro compared to the pound, and which may or may not be permanent, to come close to matching, let alone supplanting the Premier League, at least with regards to revenue,\" he said. \n \nDespite Manchester United's relative failure on the pitch last season, the club has topped Deloitte's Football Money League in terms of overall revenue for the first time in more than a decade. \n \nUnited \u2013 who were last on top in the 2003/04 campaign \u2013 earned record total revenue of \u20ac689 million euros \u2013 and dislodged Champions League holders Real Madrid who have ruled the roost for 11 years. \n \nThe Premier League's clubs are currently enjoying the proceeds of a £5.14-billion UK television rights deal for three years up to 2019 \u2013 up a staggering 70% on the previous agreement. \n \nIncluding overseas rights, the present Premier League broadcasting deal is worth £8.3 billion. \u2014 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Premier League stars

\nAhead of a series of elections, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will unveil a budget on Wednesday that analysts say will aim to offset the impact from the so-called demonetisation programme with stimulus measures. \n \n\"The overarching focus of the budget will somehow indicate a gain from pain mentality \u2013 how the pain of demonetisation helped the government get some extra resources that it can now spread around,\" Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA, told AFP. \n \n\"It's going to be a budget that is meant to soothe the pain.\" \n \nBefore Prime Minister Narendra Modi's shock decision in November to pull all 500 and 1,000 rupee notes from circulation, the International Monetary Fund had forecast India's economy would grow 7.6 percent in 2016, faster than any other major country. \n \nBut as authorities struggled to print replacement notes fast enough, causing consumer spending to plunge, the IMF knocked a percentage point off its forecast. The government's prediction is 7.1 percent growth. \n \nBy painting demonetisation as a blitz on corruption and cash-hoarding that will ultimately boost tax revenues, Modi has so far escaped a major backlash. While there were massive queues outside banks in the weeks afterwards, they have now subsided while limits on withdrawals have eased. \n \nElectoral test \n \nBut voters in four states \u2013 including the key battlegrounds of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab \u2013 will have a chance to deliver their verdict when they begin going to the polls in multi-phase elections from Feb 4. \n \nAnalysts say the polls are another reason why the government will be tempted to increase spending on health, education and a rural employment scheme. \n \nThere are also expectations of a support package for small and medium-sized businesses which have been particularly hard hit as they are heavily cash-dependent. \n \n\"We 100% expect a social focused budget,\" said Malik as he considered the calculations for Modi half way through his five-year term. \n \n\"The focus in the first two-and-a-half years was on reviving growth ... We're at the half way point now and there are some elections ahead so the shift is towards the social sector.\" \n \nBig business, hit by a drop in manufacturing and construction activity after the cash crunch, also wants help. \n \nPankaj Patel, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said his members hoped for a cut in corporate tax from 30% to 25%  and increased infrastructure spending. \n \n\"We're in an uncertain world and we need the support of the government,\" Patel told AFP. \n \n'Uncertain world' \n \nAnalysts are worried about how the government plans to fund that support. \n \n\"The central question before the government is whether a fresh round of fiscal stimulus is required to offset some of the ill effects of currency delegalisation,\" Devendra Pant, chief economist at India Ratings & Research, said in a recent note. \n \n\"The fiscal room for stepping up expenditure has to either come from higher revenue collection or higher fiscal deficit. With growth expected to fall ... the government is clearly staring at lower tax collection.\" \n \nOne area that offers some wriggle room is the budget deficit target. \n \nThe current deficit is 3.5 percent of GDP and the government had said it would reduce that to three percent for the fiscal year starting in April. \n \nBut in the face of lower tax earnings and a probable stimulus budget, analysts now expect a revised target of around 3.3 percent. \n \nIn a recent note, Morgan Stanley said \"the pace of fiscal consolidation will be slower than expected\" as the government \"will find it difficult to cut back spending aggressively because the economy is recovering\" from demonetisation. \n \nNevertheless, analysts say investors will be unimpressed by any dialing back of fiscal consolidation plans. \n \n\"Foreign investors will be cautious about this shift in political orientation,\" said Malik. \"It doesn't change India's structural story, but it takes away a bit of the shine in terms of growth expectations.\" \u2014 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Economics news","group":"Society"}],"title":"India looks to ease pain from cash crunch in budget","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"MY","country":"Malaysia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"The Sun Daily","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"197225853","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"36"},"name":"The Sun Daily","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thesundaily.my"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202954716","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:53:59Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

And in this meadow there lived a Snowlygaster. He was as big as a house, as high as a house, as long as a house, and as wide as a house. Never was there another animal as big as the Snowlygaster. \n\nHe had two heads! One like a horse's head with soft brown eyes and a flowing white mane. One like a dragon's head with flashing blue eyes and covered with green scales. This head breathed fire from its nose and mouth. No animal was ever kinder than the Snowlygaster's horse head. And none was ever more ferocious than the green dragon head. \n\nNow the Snowlygaster had eight legs, four like a horse's legs, and four like a dragon's legs. When he drew up his dragon legs and ran on his horse's legs, he could go faster than the wind. But when he drew up his horse's legs and stood on his dragon legs, the wind stopped. The earth held its breath. So powerful was the Snowlygaster on his dragon legs that he could lick any beast that lived then, or lives now, or ever will live! \n\nAbout the Author: \nBorn in 1924 at her grandmother's house in Chico, California, Donna Tisdale, her parents, and her two sisters lived in a wilderness logging town in Feather River Canyon, California.

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

Angelelli is about a minute ahead of Renger van der Zande, who is driving the No. 90 Riley for VisitFlorida Racing. \n\nIf Angelelli and his teammates can stay there, they would clinch a victory in Gordon's first Rolex 24 race in a decade and give Angelelli a win in his final race. Angelelli is retiring as a full-time driver and focusing on co-owning the team and running the Cadillac program. \n\nOther class leaders at the halfway mark: Joey Hand in the No. 66 Ford in the GT Le Mans class; Nicholas Boulle in the No. 38 Oreca in the Prototype Challenge class; and Jeff Segel in the No. 86 Acura in the GT Daytona class. \n\n--- \n\n12:30 a.m. \n\nThe Tequila Patron team has reason for some late-night shots. \n\nBrendon Hartley, driving on cold tires, turned into a Porsche driven by Wolf Henzler and crashed hard into the outside wall at Daytona International Speedway with about 14 hours to go in the Rolex 24 race early Sunday. Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year. \n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car. He turned it over to Seb Morris in third as the Cadillac teams had put all but one car in the prototype class at least a lap down. \n\n--- \n\n2:30 p.m. \n\nThe 55th running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona is underway, with pole-sitter Joao Barbosa leading the 55-car field to the green flag. \n\nThe twice-around-the-clock endurance race began under cool temperatures and cloudy skies, with a threat of steady rain predicted for later Saturday. \n\nFour-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon started the race in the pits, with Wayne Taylor Racing teammate Ricky Taylor opening behind the wheel of the No. 10 Cadillac. \n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" runner-up and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe, four-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay also are in the field. \n\nChip Ganassi Racing, which has dominated the Rolex in recent years, has two entries. One of them includes Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais, who won their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer non-durables news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Luxury goods news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Switzerland news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NASCAR news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The Latest: Jeff Gordon, Taylor Racing halfway home to Rolex","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Harrison","zipCode":"39507","state":"Mississippi","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Gulfport","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sun Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658155","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6447"},"name":"Sun Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sunherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202971995","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n--- \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n--- \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Johnston","zipCode":"27577","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Smithfield","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Raleigh News & Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658506","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2271"},"name":"Raleigh News & Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202977905","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:47:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I\u2019ve come to even greater appreciation for GM A.J. Preller, and the sheer depth of this system. Since Preller took control of the organization he\u2019s turned over the farm system in a failed attempt to compete, and then almost immediately sold off the win now pieces to land himself a new and better crop of prospect talent. Long known for his savvy signings on the international market during his time with the Rangers , Preller went bananas in the international period in 2016 landing seemingly everyone but Kevin Maitan. With the first wave of talent making it\u2019s way to Petco in 2017, the future is looking bright for long suffering Padres fans. Preller has been aggressive on the trade market too, constantly reminding Dave Dombrowski that he has some ungodly incriminating evidence against him. Seriously, it\u2019s got to be so good\u2026 Then came the Rule 5 draft where the Padres pulled the unprecedented task of acquiring the top three picks, and adding a fourth player later. It\u2019s his cold, calculated, and creative approach to acquiring talent that has made him one of my favorite executives in baseball. So believe me, I was more than happy to check in his dragon eggs for this Sunday\u2019s post. It\u2019s the Top San Diego Padres Prospects for 2017 Fantasy Baseball. \n \nTier 1: Specs On The Beach \nPotential stars. Consensus T100 prospects with premium fantasy ceilings. \n \nAnderson Espinoza, RHP | Age: 18 | ETA: 2019 | 2016 Level: A \n \nIt is with the heavy heart of a disappointed Red Sox fan that I write this blurb on Espinoza. After signing for $1.8 million out of Venezuela in the 2014-15 International period, the small righty burst onto the scene gaining the admiration of scouts, front office types, and dynasty owners a like. He offers a double plus fastball, and two plus secondary pitches in his change and curve. The move to the Padres is certainly a long term upgrade as his park, division, and league setup improves dramatically. It\u2019s important to keep in mind how young Espinoza has been at each level along the way. He has easy repeatable mechanics, and effortlessly ramps his heater up to the upper 90\u2019s, even touching 100 on occasion. The only negative I can see is his slight build, but you know how I feel about short righties. Hopefully my spirit animal AJ Preller can build a contender by the time he hits Petco. \n \nHunter Renfroe , OF | Age: 24 | ETA: 2017 | 2016 Level: MLB/AAA \n \nDo you like power? Raw, nasty, blistering, sticky power? Sees head nodding.. Yes, me too, and Renfroe has it in spades. With bat speed, serious swing tilt, caveman strength, and a pull happy approach there\u2019s real 30 homer power here. The flaws are in the approach, though it\u2019s yet to really hurt his minor league batting average, as he\u2019s a career .283 hitter in the minors. I would expect him to break camp with the Friars, and start from the jump. Serious contender for NL rookie of the year. Grey covered him earlier in the offseason, it has gifs! \n \nManuel Margot , OF | Age: 22 | ETA: 2017 | 2016 Levels: MLB/AAA \n \nIn an attempt to make the Padres great again, Dave Dombrowski traded away a significant package of talent in order to acquire Craig Kimbrel . Margot was the jewel of that haul. As he looks to be on the cusp of a major league job in 2017, with a chance at making an immediate impact. Arguably the premier hit tool/speed prospect in the minors, .300 batting averages and 25+ steal seasons should be a staple of Margot\u2019s game. The reports on the power are conflicting, but I see him topping out at 12-15 homers unless he adjusts his swing. Regardless he makes hard contact to all fields, and knows how to put the bat on the ball. \n \nAdrian Morejon, LHP | Age: 17 | ETA: 2020 | 2016 Level: Refugee \n \nI\u2019m just going to come out in the open and say this, I sweat Morejon. He and not Lazaro Armenteros (Lazarito) is my top ranked Cuban coming out of last year\u2019s international class, and there\u2019s good reason. Here\u2019s what I wrote about Morejon when I ranked him 12th in my first year player draft rankings . \u201cCuban lefty with oodles of upside, and the stuff to match. Throws a plus fastball in the low to mid 90\u2019s range, and two changeups. One that\u2019s more of a knuckle change with late dive, and the other which is your traditional change with sink and run. Also features a curveball that he\u2019s shown feel for. Smooth mechanics, and clean arm action are both pluses toward his ability to stick as a starter.\u201d \n \nTier 2: Floorboreds \nLacking the \u201cstar\u201d upside. They might have some warts, but their ETAs are on the horizon. \n \nJacob Nix, RHP | Age: 21 | ETA: 2019 | 2016 Level: A \n \nA talented righty who was part of the Houston\u2019s Brady Aiken debacle. I don\u2019t want to rehash the thing, but more or less when they didn\u2019t sign Aiken they lost his slot money, some of which they needed to sign Nix. Instead he did a post grad year at the infamous IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, and was then taken in the 3rd round of the 2015 draft. Nix throws a mid 90\u2019s fastball, a high 70\u2019s 12-6 curve, and a changeup, and throws all of them for strikes. Looks to be mid-rotation innings eater with solid ratios. \n \nAllen Cordoba, SS | Age: 21 | ETA: 2017 | 2016 Level: A \n \nCordoba has been racking in the accolades since coming over to the states. After winning the MVP of the Gulf Coast League in 2015, he followed it up with a batting title in the Appy League last year, posting a .362 average. The Padres added him as the jewel of their Rule 5 draft haul this year, which means he\u2019s going to get a shot to stick on the big league roster all season. He brings an above average hit tool and speed to the table, as well as good instincts. The Padres obviously believe he\u2019s advanced enough to handle some reps with the big club. \n \nEric Lauer, LHP | Age:21 | ETA: 2018 | 2016 Level:A/Rk \n \nLadies and gentlemen your division 1 ERA leader for 2016, with a sterling average of 0.69. Lauer is a lefty with good stuff across the board, and plus control to match. Some scouting reports label him as a number 5 starter, but with his track record dating back to High School it\u2019s tough for me to buy there isn\u2019t mid-rotation upside here. He throws two above average offerings in his fastball and slider, and two average offerings in his curve and change. Lauer\u2019s pitchability, easy mechanics, and consistent strike throwing tell me he\u2019ll be a fast mover more than likely reaching Petco sometime in 2018. \n \nMichael Gettys, OF | Age: 21 | ETA: 2018 | 2016 Level: A+/A \n \nThe Padres took a shot on Gettys back in the 2014 draft, believing they could mold the raw toolsy player into a future major leaguer. While there have been bumps in the road, 2016 was a major breakout, as Gettys showed improved bat to ball skills and plate approach. He has plus speed swiping 33 bases in 2016, and tapped into his average power swatting 12 homers across two levels. Granted the power surge looks suspiciously Cal League aided, where he hit 9 of his 12 homers and ran less. There are still serious swing and miss worries, and he\u2019s still a work in progress, but he made some major strides last season. \n \nCarlos Asuaje , 2B/3B | Age: 24 | ETA: 2017 | 2016 Level: MLB/AAA \n \nAnother member of the traded for Kimbrel club, Asuaje broke out with AAA El Paso in 2016 slashing .321/.378/.473 with 9 homers and 10 steals. In a lot of ways I see a poor man\u2019s lefthanded Dustin Pedroia in Asuaje. He has above average contact skills, average speed that plays up due to a high baseball IQ and good instincts, as well as surprising power. I think Asuaje is a player that\u2019s going to fly under the radar. He\u2019ll battle with Ryan Schimpf for the second base job, but he has the versatility to play a utility roll. \n \nOthers: Phil Maton, Jose Rondon , Javier Guerra , Buddy Reed, Jacob Nix, Dinelson Lamet, Hansel Rodriguez \n \nTier 3: Long Shot Lolitas \nSexy ceilings, but these youngsters also come with risks and distant ETAs \n \nCal Quantrill, RHP | Age: 21 | ETA: 2019 | 2016 Level: A \n \nThe Padres had a a huge year in the draft, and international market, best exemplified by adding 3 players in the top 20 of my first year player draft ranks. Quantrill ranked 8th at the time, but my excitement for Morejon has moved them into a dead heat. Quantrill offers a lot less questions marks, while still bringing top of the rotation upside t the table. \u201cAfter not pitching for most of 2015, and all of 2016 due to Tommy John surgery, Quantrill went to the Padres at pick 8. While his ERA left something to be desired, for his first foray into proball, his peripherals were solid. Had it not been for the injury Quantrill was well on his way to being considered the best pitcher in the country in 2015. I like his mix of floor and upside, and I\u2019ve learned to bet on the talented players coming back from TJ ( Lucas Giolito and Erick Fedde to name a few).\u201d \n \nJosh Naylor , 1B/OF | Age: 19 | ETA: 2019 | 2016 Level: A+/A \n \nBetween Renfore, Jorge Ona, and Naylor the Friars have a wealth of power bats in the system for he first time in a long time. After getting some hype after a strong showing in the Future\u2019s Game festivities, the Padres traded Andrew Cashner for Naylor. His powerful lefthanded swing and hitting acumen, lead many to believe Naylor could have middle of the order upside. He\u2019ll need to improve his pitch recognition and show the ability to hit offspeed pitches in order to reach those expectations. Doesn\u2019t play well with others or with knives, and if you don\u2019t believe me google Stone Garrett Josh Naylor . \n \nLuis Urias, 2B/3B/SS | Age: 19 | ETA: 2019 | 2016 Level: A+/A \n \nA hit tool maven, Urias has used his elite bat control, a patient approach, and pitch recognition skills to a career .319 batting average in the minors. His ability to spray hits all over the field and make solid hard ground ball and line drive contact should keep his average high. Problem is he doesn\u2019t possess either of the power or speed skills we look for in our fantasy prospects. So while he fits the profile of a top of the order hitter, he\u2019s more likely to settle into the two hole, than to leadoff. His ability to play all over the infield, and make solid and consistent contact make him a high floor player for a 19 year old. After hitting .330 in the high-A Cal League, he\u2019ll more than likely start the season in AA. I\u2019ve seen the appropriate Placido Polanco comps thrown around, and think those are fair. \n \nFernando Tatis Jr., 3B | Age: 18 | ETA: 2020 | A-/Rk \n \nAcquired for James Shields , Tatis looks like another steal for the Padres. He possesses plus bat speed and power, looking like an exciting but raw prospect. Son of former major leaguer, and phony Microsoft Paint Di Vinci Fernando Tatis. He has contact issues, and it\u2019s because there\u2019s a lot going on with his swing. Which is definitely something he has to work through.  Regardless I\u2019m interested \n \nJorge Ona, OF | Age: 20 | ETA: 2021 | 2016 Level: N/A \n \nOne of the most heavily debated prospects of the 2016 J2 class, Ona has one undeniably skill on all scouting reports, power. A physical specimen who burst onto the scene in the 2014 Pan American Championship where he hit .636 with 4 homers in 8 games, and slugging % of 1.364. The reports out of instructs and those that have seen him recently is that he looks rusty after not playing competitive baseball for close tot two years. Fear not, he\u2019s not the first player to show rust after a lengthy layoff, and I\u2019ll trust A.J. Preller\u2019s track record on the international market. I\u2019ve seen comps range the gambit from Kirby Puckett to Dayan Viciedo, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Ona has his fans and his detractors. \n \nChris Paddack, RHP | Age: 21 | ETA: 2019 | 2016 Level: A \n \nAn absolute trade robbery was committed when Paddack was acquired for Fernando Rodney . The talented righty was off to a great full season debut prior to the trade, which was then followed by forearm tightness in July, and TJ in August. So you won\u2019t see Paddack for a year plus, but he\u2019s a worthwhile stash due to his elite swing and miss stuff. His changeup is a plus plus pitch, he throws a mid to low 90\u2019s above average fastball, and an average curve he\u2019s shown feel for. \n \nOthers: Luis Almanzar, Mason Thompson, Jeisson Rosario, Hudson Potts, Reggie Lawson, Gabriel Arias, Logan Allen \n \nCheck Out Our Minor League Preview Index for all articles and podcasts on all 30 teams!","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ralph Lifshitz"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: MLB - San Diego Padres news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: Minor League Baseball news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: MLB news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: baseball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"2017 Minor League Preview: San Diego Padres","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Yard Barker","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"459817831","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Yard Barker","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","Baseball"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.yardbarker.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://razzball.com/teams/san-diego-padres","http://razzball.com/teams/texas-rangers","http://razzball.com/teams/boston-red-sox","http://razzball.com/player/15464/Hunter+Renfroe/","http://razzball.com/hunter-renfroe-2017-fantasy-outlook/","http://razzball.com/player/14712/Manuel+Margot/","http://razzball.com/player/6655/Craig+Kimbrel/","http://razzball.com/dynasty-first-year-player-draft-rankings-2017-fantasy-baseball/","http://razzball.com/player/15197/Carlos+Asuaje/","http://razzball.com/player/8370/Dustin+Pedroia/","http://razzball.com/player/9953/Ryan+Schimpf/","http://razzball.com/player/14140/Jose+Rondon/","http://razzball.com/player/17292/Javier+Guerra/","http://razzball.com/player/15474/Lucas+Giolito/","http://razzball.com/player/18839/Josh+Naylor/","http://razzball.com/player/8782/Andrew+Cashner/","http://razzball.com/player/7059/James+Shields/","http://razzball.com/player/494/Fernando+Rodney/","http://razzball.com/2017-razzball-minor-league-preview-index/"],"sequenceId":"695202978976","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:38Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n--- \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n--- \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Ada","zipCode":"83707","state":"Idaho","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Boise","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Idaho Statesman","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669368","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2631"},"name":"Idaho Statesman","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.idahostatesman.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695202984938","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president.\n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year.\n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar.\n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar.\n\nHow does this happen?\n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market.\n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds.\n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period.\n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent.\n\nBonds are for fear\n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel.\n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again.\n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half.\n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER\n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVIS Chicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

Only later did a White House official, responding to a question, acknowledge that sanctions were not among the topics the two leaders discussed.\n\nIn the first week of his presidency, Trump has been noncommittal on lifting sanctions imposed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, in response to U.S. findings of interference by Russia in the election. Sanctions by the U.S. and its allies were in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and other actions in the Baltic region.\n\nBoth descriptions of the call focused on the positive aspects of a new American leader engaging with the Russian president. In a brief statement, the White House said the discussion was \"a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair.\"\n\nThe two leaders discussed \"a range in topics from mutual cooperation in defeating ISIS to efforts in working together to achieve more peace throughout the world including Syria,\" the White House statement said, using an acronym for the militant group.\n\nThe White House official who spoke after the statement was issued said Putin brought up several times that Islamic terrorism was a \"common foe\" for the U.S. and Russia. The official was not authorized to disclose details of the call by name and insisted on anonymity.\n\nAddressing topics not mentioned in the White House statement, the Kremlin said that the two leaders discussed the importance of \"restoring mutually beneficial trade and economic ties between business circles of the two countries.\"\n\nThe Kremlin also said that Putin and Trump spoke in particular about international issues, including the fight against terrorism, the Arab-Israeli conflict, Iran's nuclear program, the situation on the Korean peninsula and the Ukraine crisis.\n\nMoscow has applauded Trump's promises to rebuild U.S.-Russian relations, which have been pushed to their worst level since the Cold War by the Ukraine crisis, war in Syria and allegations of Russian meddling in U.S. elections.\n\nTrump signed a presidential memorandum on the plan to defeat the Islamic State group Saturday, including in it the possibility of teaming up with \"new coalition partners,\" suggesting that pairing up with Russia on counterterrorism issues wasn't off the table.\n\nWhen asked by reporters about sanctions on Friday, Trump responded: \"We'll see what happens. As far as the sanctions, very early to be talking about that.\"\n\nIn 2014, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region and backed separatists fighting government forces in eastern Ukraine, drawing widespread condemnation in Europe and the United States. In response, sanctions were implemented against sectors of Russia's economy, including financial services, energy, mining and defense. The Obama administration also sanctioned people in Putin's inner circle.\n\nShortly before leaving office, Obama also ordered sanctions on Russian spy agencies, closed two Russian compounds in the United States and expelled 35 diplomats that he said were really spies. These sanctions followed an assessment by U.S. intelligence that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump.\n\nTrump's tempered approach to U.S.-Russia relations has already raised concern among several European allies who believe keeping Russia in check is essential to regional security. Domestically, some Republican lawmakers have warned against easing sanctions and pledged to put them into law.\n\nTrump also placed calls Saturday to French President Francois Hollande, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JULIE PACE and VIVIAN SALAMA"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Officials say Trump, Putin avoided topic of sanctions","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Richland","zipCode":"29201","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Columbia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"South Carolina State","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660449","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1236"},"name":"South Carolina State","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thestate.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article129445414.html","https://twitter.com/share?text=Officials%20say%20Trump%2c%20Putin%20avoided%20topic%20of%20sanctions&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thestate.com%2fnews%2fpolitics-government%2fnational-politics%2farticle129445414.html","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thestate.com%2fnews%2fpolitics-government%2fnational-politics%2farticle129445414.html&title=Officials+say+Trump%2c+Putin+avoided+topic+of+sanctions","https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thestate.com%2fnews%2fpolitics-government%2fnational-politics%2farticle129445414.html","http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thestate.com%2fnews%2fpolitics-government%2fnational-politics%2farticle129445414.html&description=Officials+say+Trump%2c+Putin+avoided+topic+of+sanctions&media=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mcclatchy-wir","http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article129445414.html","http://www.mcclatchyreprints.com/"],"sequenceId":"695202991098","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/wire_photos/6et7r8/picture129201984/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_1140/Congress_Russia_Sanctions_65480.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

On a day when Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning immigrants from 7 Muslim countries sparked outcry on social media and protests at airports from coast to coast, the president\u2019s daughter had something else on her mind: her date outfit.\n\nJust after midnight on Sunday morning, Ivanka Trump posted a photo of herself on her Instagram and Twitter accounts dressed in a glamorous silver metallic gown, with her husband Jared Kushner dressed in a tuxedo by her side. The couple is standing in front of a mirrored wall, which shows Kushner\u2019s hand resting on Trump\u2019s posterior.\n\nThe photograph generated swift reaction on social media, with some comments highlighting the inappropriateness of the post in the midst of the humanitarian chaos that ensued Saturday in the U.S., after dozens of refugees from Syria, Iraq and other banned countries were detained at U.S. airports, American Civil Liberties Union lawyers rushed to offer aid, and protesters clogged terminals and streets in New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, Seattle and San Francisco.\n\nIvanka has faced criticism on several fronts in recent weeks, most notably when her namesake fashion label promoted a $10,000 bracelet she wore during a 60 Minutes interview the Trump family gave after the election.\u2028In early January, to comply with ethic guidelines, she officially stepped away from her brand.

Qantas is offering refunds to any passengers travelling from Australia to the United States who are affected by a new entry ban. Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days. That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.\n\nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.\n\nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government.\n\nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.\n\n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\"\n\nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.\n\n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said.\n\n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\"\n\nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. An has temporarily stopped the government from sending those who landed with valid visas out of the country.\n\nCrowds of protesters have gathered at US airports in response to the order and subsequent detainments.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 52 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"40202","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Louisville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Louisville Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"540"},"name":"Louisville Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203024878","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The idea is that there is a periodic collective motion so that one can see the system as analog of 3-D crystal with time appearing as fourth lattice dimension. One can learn more about real life time crystals at (see ). The first crystal was created by and involved magnetization. By adding a periodic driving force it was possible to generate spin flips inducing collective spin flip as a kind of domino effect. The surprise was that the period was twice the original period and small changes of the driving frequency did not affect the period. One had something more than forced oscillation \u2013 a genuine time crystal. The period of the driving force \u2013 Floquet period- was 74-75 μs and the system is measured for N=100 Floquet periods or about 7.4-7.5 milliseconds (1 ms happens to be of same order of magnitude as the duration of nerve pulse). I failed to find a comment about the size of the system. With quantum biological intuition I would guess something like the size of large neuron: about 100 micrometers. \n\nSecond law does not favor time crystals. The time in which single particle motions are thermalized is expected to be rather short. In the case of condensed matter systems the time scale would not be much larger than that for a typical rate of typical atomic transition. The gives the general idea. The decay rate is proportional to ω3d2, where ω= Δ E/hbar is the frequency difference corresponding to the energy difference between the states, d is dipole moment proportional to α a0, a0 Bohr radius and α∼ 1/137 fine structure constant. Average lifetime as inverse of the decay rate would be 1.6 ns and is expected to give a general order of magnitude estimate. \n\nThe proposal is that the systems in question emerge in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which indeed predicts a master-slave hierarchy of time and length scales with masters providing the slowly changing background in which slaves are forced to move. I am not a specialist enough to express any strong opinions about thermodynamical explanation. \n\nWhat does TGD say about the situation?\n\nTGD vision would actually solve a fundamental problem of QED caused by the assumption that proton and electron behave as independent point like particles: QED predicts a lot of non-existing quantum states since Bethe-Salpeter equation assumes degrees of freedom, which do not actually exist. Single particle descriptions (Schrödinger equation and Dirac equation) treating proton and electron effectively as single particle geometrically (rather than independent particles) having reduced mass gives excellent description whereas QED, which was thought to be something more precise, fails. Quite generally, bound states are not properly understood in QFTs. Color confinement problem is second example about : usually it is believed that the failure is solely due to the fact that color interaction is strong but the real reason might be much deeper.\n\nBiology could provide basic examples. For instance, EEG resonance frequency could be associated with time crystals assignable to the magnetic body of brain carrying dark matter with large heff/h=n \u2013 so large that dark photon energy E=hefff would correspond to an energy above thermal energy. If bio-photons result from phase transitions heff/h=n→ 1, the energy would be in visible-UV energy range. These frequencies would in turn drive the visible matter in brain and force it to oscillate coherently.\n\nNumber theoretical universality (NTU) leads to the notion of adelic space-time surface (monadic manifold) involving a discretization in an extension of rationals defining particular level in the hierarchy of adeles defining evolutionary hierarchy. heff/h=n has been identified from the beginning as the dimension of poly-sheeted covering assignable to space-time surface. The action of the Galois group of extensions indeed gives rise to covering space. The number n of sheets would the order of Galois group implying heff/h=n, which is bound to increase during evolution so that the complexity increases. \n\nIndeed, since n is positive integer evolution is analogous to a diffusion in half-line and n unavoidably increases in the long run just as the particle diffuses farther away from origin (by looking what gradually happens near paper basket one understands what means). The increase of n implies the increase of maximal negentropy and thus of negentropy. Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP) follows from adelic physics alone and there is no need to postulate it separately. Things get better in the long run although we do not live in the best possible world as Leibniz who first proposed the notion of monad proposed! \n\nAdelic physics allows also a strong grasp to metabolism and bio-catalysis \u2013 the key elements of biology. Why metabolic energy would be needed? Intuitive answer is that evolution requires it and that evolution corresponds to the increase of n=heff/h. To see the answer to the question, notice that the energy scale for the bound states of an atom is proportional to 1/h2 and for dark atom to 1/heff2 ∝ n2 (do not confuse n with the integer n labelling the states of hydrogen atom!). Dark atoms have smaller binding energies and their creation by a phase transition increasing the value of n demands a feed of energy \u2013 metabolic energy! If the metabolic energy feed stops, n is gradually reduced. What is remarkable that the scale of atomic binding energies decreases with n only in dimension D=3. In other dimensions it increases and in D=4 one cannot even speak of bound states! Life based on metabolism seems to make sense only in spatial dimension D=3. Note however that there are also other quantum states than atomic states with different dependence of energy on heff.\n\nAt least in the catalyst molecule some atom(s) would be in a state with some n1 and in the reaction n would be reduced and liberate binding energy. This energy would help the reactants to overcome the potential wall making the reaction slow so that reaction would proceed swiftly. After they would liberate binding energy back to the catalyst molecule. Catalyst would serve as a matchmaker helping the shy potential lovers to overcome the barrier. Note again that is possible only in D=3!\n\nFor a summary of earlier postings see . .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"TGD diary"},"topics":[],"title":"Time crystals, macroscopic quantum coherence, and adelic physics","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Before It's News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"557901141","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"326"},"name":"Before It's News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://beforeitsnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://tgdtheory.fi/public_html/articles/progress.pdf","http://tinyurl.com/js2h6b4%E2%80%B3%3EMoore"],"sequenceId":"695203027537","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:29Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But plenty did, culminating in a 17-12 loss to Argentina that meant the three-time defending champions finished sixth.  \n \nSouth Africa won the final, with a convincing win 26-6 over Fiji \n \nThe World Sevens Series continues in Sydney this weekend and New Zealand co-coach Waldrom is desperate for the change in scenery to also herald a change of fortunes. The team had been fairly chipper after beating England 24-0 on Sunday afternoon, but the Argentine defeat knocked the smile off everyone's face. \n \n  \n   \n   \n \n\"It's been a pretty tough week. We had to deal with a lot around the old [Gordon] Tietjens controversy, the poor [crowd] numbers and the lack of support and then the coach getting Bell's Palsy so his face is a bit munted and he's talking a bit funny,\" Waldrom said. \n \n\"The guys have been through a lot and to walk away on that note's been disappointing, because we know we're better than that.\" \n \nBell's Palsy is a kind of facial paralysis which affected Waldrom in the last few days and was the last thing he needed. \n \nParticularly at a time when the team have been under pressure regarding the lack of spectator interest in this tournament. One of the - many - remedies mooted has been for New Zealand to pick more \"name\" players. Who knows, it might work. In the meantime, though, that kind of talk hardly makes young players feel they deserve to be here representing New Zealand. \n \n\"We've tried to stay away from it. It's nothing we can control. Obviously better performances might get more support,\" said Waldrom. \n \nFiji's supporters at Westpac Stadium appeared to outnumber - and definitely out-sung - New Zealand's in Sunday's quarterfinal and that hurt the team. \n \n\"Obviously we were out-supported by the Fijians in that one and to me it felt the Argentinian crowd was even louder than ours. That's a little bit disappointing for the boys that when they do get to play in front of a home crowd, it's not there.\" \n \nA lack of support won't hurt so much when the team hit Sydney where Waldrom is confident they'll be better. They'll definitely need to be, because they can't continue to make the sort of soft errors and missed tackles that thwarted their title aspirations in Wellington. \n \n\"There was some pretty stern words from everyone after that [Argentine] game and we're certainly good enough. You've just got to look at some of the games yesterday [Saturday] and the England game,\" Waldrom said. \n \n\"If we can put in six games like that then we can certainly be a contender for the cup.\" \n \nTim Mikkelson hobbled off early against Argentina and captain Scott Curry copped a few knocks too. Waldrom indicated that New Zealand would probably take the same side to an event at which they're again the defending champions. \n \nSouth Africa will be the undoubted favourites in Sydney after claiming their dominant win in Wellington.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HAMISH BIDWELL"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Sydney or the bush for NZ","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Waikato Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169690101","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Waikato Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203038623","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Captain Scott Curry restored the host's lead after the break and then the game ebbed and flowed until Bazan Velez went in again to make it 12-12. \n \nBut another New Zealand turnover settle the issue and Franco Sabato won the match for Argentina with a try in the corner. \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \nHaving won the last three editions of this event, finishing sixth wasn't particularly impressive. However there were encouraging signs in the shape of forward Iopu Iopu-Aso and playmaker Koroi. \n \nKoroi is just out of Feilding High School, but his Wellington cameos suggest the 18-year-old has talent. \n \nTalent of the sort that made Manawatu's Tomasi Cama one of the most feared ball-players on the sevens circuit. Cama is now co-coach of New Zealand and picked Koroi despite him not appearing at the recent national tournament. \n \n\"He's probably better than me,\" Cama said of Koroi. \n  \nThe teenager produced some magical touches to guide New Zealand to a 24-0 win over England in their fifth-place semifinal and looks to have a bit to offer, having played on the wing for New Zealand Secondary Schools last year. \n \n\"This is his first tournament and for a young fella he looks like he's been playing for a few years now. There's always things to work on and hopefully he's going to kick on from now,\" said Cama. \n \n\"When you look at playmakers, obviously they can pass, they can kick. But one thing they do have, they do have time when they have the ball and that's when they look forward and make decisions.\" \n \nIt's Koroi's composure that really excites Cama. \n \n\"At this stage I don't have to do a lot. He's got all the talent. If anything it's just the little things we can work on off the field to make sure that he gets out there and does what he does best.\" \n \nKoroi can't quite believe this is happening. He grew up idolising players such as Cama and team-mates DJ Forbes and Tim Mikkelson. Being picked for Wellington was one thing, but the idea he might play - and play well - was quite another. \n \n\"I've been very nervous playing out there. Very nervous,\" Koroi said. \n \nIt's just that he hasn't played like a nervous bloke. \n \n\"Just like Junior [Cama] says, when you get out on the field just play your game [and] stay calm under pressure, because you're a playmaker.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HAMISH BIDWELL"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"New Zealand end Wellington Sevens with defeat to Argentina","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Waikato Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169690101","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Waikato Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203038943","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Johnson & Johnson on Thursday announced it was buying Europe's biggest bio-pharmaceutical firm Actelion for $30 billion (27.9 billion euros) in a deal that creates a new spin-off company. \n\nThe world's biggest producer of healthcare goods will acquire all the outstanding shares of Switzerland-based Actelion for $280 per share, the two companies said in a joint statement. \n\nWith the deal, which has been approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to be finalised by the middle of the year, Actelion will receive a 46-percent premium on its average share price over the past 60 days and a 23-percent premium on its closing price on Wednesday. \n\nThe price was also above analyst expectations, with Jefferies Equity Research for instance having anticipated Actelion would go for around 250 Swiss francs ($250, 233 euros) per share. \n\nInvestors appeared pleased with the deal, sending Actelion's share price surging 20.5 percent in afternoon trading to 273.90 Swiss francs apiece, as the Swiss stock exchange's main SMI index was up just 0.59 percent. \n\n\"We believe this transaction offers compelling value\" to shareholders in both companies, Alex Gorsky, Johnson & Johnson chairman and chief executive said in the statement. \n\n\"The transaction structure will provide Johnson & Johnson flexibility to accelerate investment in its industry-leading, innovative pipeline to drive additional growth,\" he said. \n\nThe US company said the deal should over the long term increase its revenue growth rate by at least one percent and its earnings growth rate by as much as two percent over what analysts currently anticipate. \n\nR&D spin-off \n\nThe transaction will also create a new Swiss-listed firm focusing on the research and development of new drugs, the statement said. \n\nThe new R&D company being spun off will \"allow us to continue with our successful culture of innovation,\" said Actelion founder and chief executive Jean-Paul Clozel. \n\nClozel, a French cardiologist who will head the new company, said it would be \"enormously exciting to continue to develop new and differentiated products, in multiple therapeutic areas, to improve the lives of patients.\" \n\nJohnson & Johnson has agreed to inject 1.0 billion Swiss francs ($1.0 billion, 935 million euros) into the new R&D entity, in exchange for 16 percent of the company, and with the option of expanding its ownership by an additional 16 percent. \n\nActelion, founded in 1996, and has made a name for itself developing and commercialising drugs for rare and underserved diseases, and is the world leader in medicines treating pulmonary arterial hypertension\u2014a chronic, life-threatening disorder characterised by abnormally high blood pressure in the arteries between the heart and lungs. \n\nThe company has long been considered an attractive target for acquisition, but Clozel has always fiercely defended its independence. \n\nAs early as 2010, Johnson & Johnson's name was mentioned among possible suitors. \n\nAnd last November the US company confirmed it had initiated contact with Actelion. \n\nHowever, it subsequently said it had been unable to nail down a deal that would be acceptable to its shareholders, allowing market speculation to turn to Sanofi as the most likely buyer. \n\nAnalysts meanwhile said Thursday they did not expect any other companies to come forward and challenge Thursday's deal. \n\nIn light of the amount Johnson & Johnson is dishing out, \"we do not envisage any counterbids or competition concerns,\" Jefferies Equity Research said in a research note. \n\nZurich Cantonal Bank analyst Sibylle Bischofberger agreed, saying no other suitors were likely to come forward and challenge \"the already high price.\" \n\n© 2017 AFP \n\nExplore

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 52 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hinds","zipCode":"39209","state":"Mississippi","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jackson","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"16 WAPT","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169681288","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"173"},"name":"16 WAPT","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wapt.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203047093","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Nikki Haley resigned from her position when the U.S. Senate confirmed her as the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. That meant that the lieutenant governor, Henry McMaster, was elevated to governor. \n \nAccording to the South Carolina Constitution, the leader of the state Senate, the president pro tem, becomes the lieutenant governor. That\u2019s what happened when former Lt. Gov. Ken Ard was forced to resign due to ethics violations. Then-Senate President Pro Tem Glenn McConnell became lieutenant governor. \n \nMcConnell did not want the position. The Senate president pro tem is one of the most powerful lawmakers in South Carolina, and this is a legislature-driven state. The lieutenant governor\u2019s position is mostly ceremonial and lacks any real power. \n \nBut McConnell said that his duty under the state constitution was clear, and he became lieutenant governor. \n \nSenate President Pro Tem Hugh Leatherman did not recognize his constitutional duty. Despite the fact that he took the same oath of office as his colleagues to \u201cpreserve, protect, and defend the constitution of this state,\u201d he decided he would escape from his duty. \n \nTo Leatherman\u2019s credit, he was open about shirking his duty. He was completely transparent about his intentions of holding onto power and twisting and evading the rules of the constitution. He told his fellow senators when he ran for re-election as president pro tem that he wouldn\u2019t serve as lieutenant governor if the situation arose. \n \nSo when it did arise, he resigned his position and allowed then-Sen. Kevin Bryant of Anderson to be elected Senate president pro tem so that he could become lieutenant governor. Once that transition was done, state senators elected Leatherman to resume his powerful post. \n \nIt was not unanimous. Sen. Harvey Peeler of Gaffney challenged Leatherman for the president pro tem position, and 16 Republican senators voted for him. These senators recognized that our state leaders should follow the rules laid out in the constitution. \n \nThey also realize that as Senate president pro tem and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Leatherman holds too much power for one man. \n \nIn the end, this dance allowed an 85-year-old senator, who has amassed a great deal of power by virtue of his longevity, to hold onto that authority. \n \nSenate Majority Leader Shane Massey correctly called it \u201ca shameless and obvious game of musical chairs.\u201d He pointed out that people know when politicians don\u2019t play by the rules. And the people are sick of politicians avoiding the rules. \n \nThis entire episode demonstrates that too many lawmakers are concerned only with their internal alliances, their deals to support one another, their drive to accumulate their own power. They are not concerned with fulfilling their oath of office. They are not concerned with serving the people of this state. \n \nLeatherman just pulled off a shameless, naked power grab and an evasion of his responsibility under the South Carolina Constitution. Twenty-eight state senators helped him do it. Their constituents should ask them who they are really serving \u2013 the public or their cronies.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Herald-Journal Editorial Board"},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Editorial: A sad display in Columbia","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Spartanburg","zipCode":"29304","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Spartanburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Spartanburg Herald-Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169701472","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"562"},"name":"Spartanburg Herald-Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.goupstate.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203050785","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

This ideal conveys that all should be given equal opportunity to achieve success through hard work, determination and initiative. \n \nThe original architect of this phrase, James Truslow Adams, envisioned a nation in which all would have the opportunity to achieve their \u201cfullest stature\u201d regardless of the situation of their birth. A group in our nation that uniquely embodies these ideals is the \u201cDreamers.\u201d \n \nDreamers are our neighbors, co-workers and friends who were brought to the United States unlawfully when they were very young. For many, the U.S. is the only country they\u2019ve ever known. \n \nMost Dreamers identify as American. However, due to circumstances outside their control, they face significant barriers to integrating fully into our communities. Before 2012, Dreamers could not legally work or obtain driver\u2019s licenses. They lived in constant fear of deportation and have faced significant challenges to pursuing higher education. \n \nTo help prioritize immigration enforcement and remove some of the barriers to achieving the American dream, the Obama administration implemented Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in 2012. DACA provides temporary deportation protection and renewable work permits to those who qualify. \n \nDACA recipients must be in school, have a high school diploma or be a veteran, and pass background checks. More than 740,000 DACA recipients now are able to contribute more fully to their communities through the ability to secure a job, pay more in taxes, attend college (although they are not eligible for any federal aid) and obtain driver\u2019s licenses. \n \nWhile polls show that most Americans believe this group should be protected, many criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s use of executive action to protect Dreamers. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to overturn Obama\u2019s executive orders, though what he will do about DACA and Dreamers remains uncertain. \n \nIt is clear that repealing DACA would have disastrous results on our national and state economy. The Center for American Progress recently reported that ending DACA would reduce the overall gross domestic product by $433.4 billion over 10 years. The hit to South Carolina\u2019s GDP would be $247 million annually if workers with DACA were removed from the workforce. This is money that goes back into our local economy and community. \n \nPublic schools rightly invest in students and desire for them to be \u201ccollege and career-ready\u201d regardless of their immigration status. Starting in elementary school, students are taught the value of a college degree and the skills needed prepare them for a successful career. \n \nYet for Dreamers, college and a career are within reach with a big asterisk at best. For most students, high school graduation is a day of boundless opportunity, but for Dreamers, it can be a day of anxiety and disappointment. \n \nThrough my work at SC Test Prep, an area nonprofit that provides college readiness to students who are college bound but have financial need, and as a local leader with Bibles, Badges and Business for Immigration Reform, I have had the privilege of working with Dreamers. These are students who achieve good grades, volunteer in their communities and aspire to contribute fully to American society \u2014 despite the constant threat of deportation for those who have not received deferred action. \n \nA growing movement in Spartanburg, through the Spartanburg Area Chamber of Commerce and the Spartanburg Academic Movement, encourages a higher level of bachelor\u2019s degree attainment among its residents. The goal is for 40 percent of Spartanburg residents to have bachelor\u2019s degrees by 2030. We cannot overlook how Dreamers can be a part of helping Spartanburg meet this goal. \n \nWith bipartisan support, Sen. Lindsey Graham has introduced the BRIDGE Act, which would temporarily extend protection for those who qualify for DACA while Congress works out a longer-term solution. The BRIDGE Act is a short-term answer for those who believe in what DACA has achieved but believed it was an overreach in presidential power. \n \nThe new Congress has much work to do. For the new administration, repealing DACA and placing Dreamers in jeopardy of losing their jobs, licenses and ability to contribute economically to their communities \u2014 not to mention deportation \u2014 should not be a priority. Members of Congress should quickly pass the BRIDGE Act. Then they should direct their attention to passing long-term immigration solutions. \n \nAmerica is great when all who consider themselves American have the opportunity to pursue success and upward mobility. Protecting the vulnerable and providing opportunities for individual achievement embody the values that make our country great. \n \nHere at home, we are one Spartanburg. Our entire community will thrive when each resident, regardless of the situation of his or her birth, has the opportunity to pursue the American dream. \n \nMeghan Smith of Spartanburg is program director for SC Test Prep and a local leader with Bibles, Badges and Business for Immigration Reform.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MEGHAN SMITHGuest columnist"},"topics":[{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Meghan Smith: Helping \u2018Dreamers\u2019 benefits all","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Spartanburg","zipCode":"29304","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Spartanburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Spartanburg Herald-Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169701472","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"562"},"name":"Spartanburg Herald-Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.goupstate.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203052690","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

As Christians, we are facing our own hypocrisy if you look at the staggering numbers of children in foster care, orphanages and in need of loving families. \n \nIf we spread the call to stop abortions, we need to step up to provide homes and meet the physical, spiritual, academic and social needs of the orphans in our communities. In my heart, I don\u2019t believe we can have it both ways. \n \nWhat if we step up now and love the orphans who are already here until there isn\u2019t a child or a mother in need who went without? Would we need to fight so hard to end abortion if loving families were willing and ready with hands outstretched for children in need? \n \nInstead of condemnation, what if we provide compassion? Instead of judgment, what if we provide just what a mother who couldn\u2019t care for her child needed \u2014 a family? \n \n\u201cIf you claim to be religious but don\u2019t control what you say and do, you are fooling yourself, and your religion is worthless. Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress.\u201d (James 1:26-27.) \n \nDawn Mitchell \n \nGreer \n \nReal America is everywhere \n \nA letter in last Sunday\u2019s newspaper showed divisiveness at its worst. To claim that the difference in the popular vote between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is irrelevant because the majority came from big cities is akin to saying that a family living on a farm in the country is more American than a family living in a tiny apartment in the city. \n \nI worked in midtown Manhattan for almost 35 years, and on any given day I encountered panhandlers and billionaires; fundamentalist Christians, orthodox Jews and atheists; people whose ancestors were pioneers and those who had just been sworn in as citizens that morning. If you understand the original motto of the United States \u2014 e pluribus unum (out of many, one) \u2014 or if you imagine this country as a giant mosaic with each person being part of the design, then the \u201creal\u201d America is everywhere. \n \nI believe a majority of New Yorkers voted against Trump because many knew someone who wasn\u2019t paid for his work, had been cheated or sued by him or had been offended by his insults. During the primaries, New Yorkers heard Trump lie about celebrations that occurred on 9/11, brag about his sexual prowess, proudly show off the five children he\u2019s had with three different women, and denigrate Mexicans, black people and Muslims, and they felt he was not the person they wanted to represent them. \n \nIf the 25.5 percent of eligible voters who elected him disagree, that is their prerogative, but to think of themselves as \u201cmainstream\u201d is delusional. \n \nNancy Kenney \n \nCampobello \n \nJust a national hissy fit \n \nTo all the local women who went to Washington for the Women\u2019s March, please explain to the area citizens what you are proud of. \n \nIs it your keynote speakers Ashley Judd making despicable remarks or Madonna wanting to blow up the White House or her uncalled-for profanity on live television? \n \nThis appears to be nothing more than a national hissy fit to many of us. Please explain. \n \nJoe McConnell \n \nTryon, N.C. \n \nNo to Article V Convention \n \nTwenty-eight states to date have filed for a Balanced Budget Amendment Constitution Article V Convention. It takes 34 states to make that happen. I am opposed to an Article V Convention for the following reasons: \n \n1. The Constitution is not the problem. It is not necessary to amend it in order to balance the budget. The House of Representatives has the authority and responsibility to do so. For some time, we have seen that it lacks the resolve to do so. \n \n2. An Article V Convention would not be obliged to limit its function to a single issue. \n \n3. An Article V Convention would enable powerful special interests to revise the Constitution in their favor or effectively eliminate it. The most damming act would be to remove Article V, which would remove a peaceful path to resolution in the future. \n \n4. I oppose an Article V Convention because it could be used to legitimize and extend overreach by federal bureaucrats. This serves to move our nation away from its founding as a constitutional republic (rule of law) and toward being a democracy (rule of men). In the republic, even when your party is not in the majority, the laws protect your rights. In the democracy, the majority rules, and it may take your freedoms as well as your property and rights. How hard is that to figure out? \n \nCibby Krell \n \nSpartanburg \n \nDemocrats\u2019 flimsy excuse \n \nThe Russians stole Hillary Clinton\u2019s crown is the best excuse Democrats have? For crying out loud, my generation had more creativity than that! \n \nAt least we whined, \u201cThe Martians stole my term paper\u201d or \u201cThe aliens did it.\u201d Most people didn\u2019t believe those, either, but if you\u2019re going to make up excuses for your mistakes and losses, use a little imagination. \n \nSheesh.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter.\n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States.\n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission.\n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted.

Great success. Great idea.\"\n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n12:20 a.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\"\n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\"\n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted.\n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days.\n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n12:10 a.m.\n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order.\n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months.\n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S.\n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips.\n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11:50 p.m.\n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive.\n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive.

Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\"\n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport.\n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015.\n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration.\n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n10:20 p.m.\n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody.\n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S.\n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night.\n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released.\n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n9:50 p.m.\n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own.\n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend.\n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia.\n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n8:30 p.m.\n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran.\n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order.\n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\"\n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\"\n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n8 p.m.\n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq.\n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning.\n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides.\n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.\n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six)\n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n7:05 p.m.\n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations.\n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\"\n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\n\nTrump signed the order Friday.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n6:40 p.m.\n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States.\n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days.\n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied.\n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay.\n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights.\n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n6:35 p.m.\n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants.\n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag.\n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month.\n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n5:45 p.m.\n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months.\n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\"\n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\"\n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n5:15 p.m.\n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel.\n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\"\n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n3 p.m.\n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport.\n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.\n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence.\n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\"\n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security.\n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n1 p.m.\n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones.\n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days.\n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\"\n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision.\n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\"\n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\"\n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"International relations news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official Says Ruling Will Not Affect Travel Ban","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"ABC News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587548","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"ABC News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.abcnews.com","publisher":"Walt Disney Company"},"linkedArticles":[{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29391598246"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29392803113"}],"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/white-house.htm","http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/national-security.htm","https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WelcomeToCanada","http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/united-nations.htm"],"sequenceId":"695203055163","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Angelelli is about a minute ahead of Renger van der Zande, who is driving the No. 90 Riley for VisitFlorida Racing. \n\nIf Angelelli and his teammates can stay there, they would clinch a victory in Gordon's first Rolex 24 race in a decade and give Angelelli a win in his final race. Angelelli is retiring as a full-time driver and focusing on co-owning the team and running the Cadillac program. \n\nOther class leaders at the halfway mark: Joey Hand in the No. 66 Ford in the GT Le Mans class; Nicholas Boulle in the No. 38 Oreca in the Prototype Challenge class; and Jeff Segel in the No. 86 Acura in the GT Daytona class. \n\n--- \n\n12:30 a.m. \n\nThe Tequila Patron team has reason for some late-night shots. \n\nBrendon Hartley, driving on cold tires, turned into a Porsche driven by Wolf Henzler and crashed hard into the outside wall at Daytona International Speedway with about 14 hours to go in the Rolex 24 race early Sunday. Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year. \n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car.

He noted that there is a steady increase in religious and ethnic conflicts in different regions of the world, which requires more attention and resolve urgently. \nOn the issue of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, the UN official stressed that there are real concerns about how to address the ongoing violence in northwestern Myanmar. \nOn Syria, the official demanded demand holding Bashar al-Assad and the officials in his regime accountable for the crimes and serious violations they have committed.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale\u2019s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\u201cThe judge\u2019s order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US \u2014 it doesn\u2019t immediately order that they be released from detention,\u201d he told CNN. \n \n\u201cWe are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\u201d he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \u201cour courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump\u2019s controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \u201conly for nationals of countries for whom\u201d members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump\u2019s order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\u201cAmerica is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump\u2019s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump\u2019s order and pledged continued action. \n \n\u201cThis should not happen in America,\u201d Velazquez said following Darweesh\u2019s release. \u201cOne by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\u201d \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\u201cBecause the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK\u2019s Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\u201cWhen Mr. Darweesh\u2019s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u2018Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\u201d the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\u201cOur courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump\u2019s order puts those who have helped us in harm\u2019s way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, titled \u201cProtection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\u201cI am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security.\u201d \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Shawnee","zipCode":"66601","state":"Kansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Topeka","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Classic Hits 99.3 The Eagle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"489466366","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Classic Hits 99.3 The Eagle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Arts"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.eagle993.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/ny-immigration-order-stay/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695203066336","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In the weeks since the Jacksonville Symphony opened the year with Sibelius\u2019s Seventh Symphony (about which I wrote last month), I\u2019ve guest-conducted with the Asheville and Dallas Symphonies and the Minnesota Orchestra. Here\u2019s a snapshot of those weeks away from home. Sunday, Jan. 8: Recover from a very intense week with Jacksonville. Sibelius\u2019s Seventh was one of those fiendishly difficult but rewarding projects that only come along a few times a year. In the afternoon I talk to the Jacksonville Jewish Community Alliance about the various projects we have going on.\n\nTuesday, Jan. 10: Fly to Asheville, N.C. Asheville has a small but very ambitious orchestra. They don\u2019t usually have guest conductors so I can feel a lot more excitement than usual at the first rehearsal. We\u2019re performing a German program of Brahms\u2019s Variations on a Theme of Haydn and Schumann\u2019s Third Symphony, the Rhenish. These are both pieces I\u2019ve conducted many times, and it\u2019s nice to refine my interpretations rather than build them from scratch as with Sibelius last week. The orchestra works incredibly hard and the concert is great fun. Several Jacksonville Symphony Board members have summer homes here and I\u2019ve been given a list of restaurant recommendations. There are just enough nights in the week to make it through them all. Quite by chance our ex-principal bassoonist and his wife are on vacation and staying in my hotel so we have some excellent tapas together, trying four different types of cured hams.\n\nSunday, Jan. 15: Back to Jacksonville. While I was away, something very exciting happened; I bought a new piano in December and it has finally been delivered. I had to sell my previous instrument when I moved to New York, so having the space for a real, six-foot grand is one of the joys of living here. The Steinway technician arrives and spends the whole day working. He installs a dehumidifier and places a special woollen cloth over the strings to prevent them from rusting. I had no idea pianos needed so much TLC to cope with Florida\u2019s humid climate. Spend the next day bashing through Beethoven sonatas rather appalled at the decay that has set into my technique.\n\nTuesday, Jan, 17: Fly to Dallas. I have long admired the Dallas Symphony and their music director, Jaap van Zweden, who will succeed Alan Gilbert at the New York Philharmonic the year after next. It\u2019s my first time conducting Dallas and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. We\u2019re presenting a concert format that\u2019s very similar to the Jacksonville Symphony\u2019s Symphony in 60: an hour of music with no intermission and a more casual atmosphere than regular concerts. The program contains a piece by the Russian composer Alfred Schnittke written in 1982, \u201cConcerto Grosso No. 2.\u201d It\u2019s an enormous and sprawling work for solo violin and cello (originally written for the great duo \u2014 and husband and wife \u2014 Oleg Kagan and Natalia Gutman). During the piece the soloists repeatedly try to say something profound and meaningful, searching for the sublime. But the orchestra has other ideas and attempts to crush them with an endless onslaught of cheap and trivial music. They burst in with noisy American rock, trashy pop, saccharine Viennese waltzes and propagandized Russian marches, stopping the soloists dead in their tracks. Schnittke wanted to portray a sense of the individual being silenced by the crassness of popular culture and the dishonesty of political discourse. It turns out to be a terrifying piece to perform the week of the presidential inauguration.\n\nSunday, Jan. 22: I return to Jacksonville for less than 24 hours. I play with my dog, Alfie, who reduces my stress level 100 percent in ten seconds. I\u2019m just able to catch the Symphony Sunday matinee, which features my friend, the esteemed conductor Hugh Wolff, and the wonderful young cellist Joshua Roman. Listening to the orchestra while sitting in the hall is very different from on the podium, and it\u2019s great to get a sense of the big picture and what we need to work on.\n\nMonday, Jan. 23: Fly to Minneapolis to conduct the Minnesota Orchestra. This city and orchestra have a very, very special place in my heart. As a conductor, I grew up here from 2009-14. The first day of rehearsals is, for me at least, wonderful and artistically vindicating. Wonderful because the orchestra is like family and there are many friends to catch up with, and because the level of playing here is astonishing. Vindicating because almost everything I spend my life asking for both in Jacksonville and as a guest conductor happens automatically. It\u2019s part of the playing culture. This is what I dream of for the Jacksonville Symphony, because it means artistically, the sky is the limit. All the rather mundane matters of playing together, listening, leading \u2014 the \u201cdental hygiene\u201d of orchestral playing, as Simon Rattle calls them \u2014 are taken care of, so we get to the meat of interpretation straight away. The concerts were originally to be conducted by Sir Neville Mariner, the famous English conductor universally known for this many wonderful recordings with his chamber orchestra, The Academy of St Martin in the Fields. He was music director of the Minnesota Orchestra from 1979 to 1986. Sadly, Sir Neville died in October at the august age of 92. I\u2019m honoured to take his place briefly, conducting his original program. It\u2019s a beautiful and strangely English offering: Mendelssohn\u2019s watery depiction of the Scottish Highlands, The Hebrides, Beethoven\u2019s First Symphony, and Dvorak\u2019s Eighth Symphony, which we wrote for the British publisher Novello. We end the concerts with Nimrod from Elgar\u2019s Enigma Variations, accompanied by a slide show of photos from Sir Neville\u2019s time with the orchestra. It\u2019s as sincere and moving a tribute as any conductor could wish for.\n\nSaturday, Jan. 28: Fly to Jacksonville. The last leg of my marathon is a thrilling set of concerts, \u201cRevel in Ravel\u201d with the home team. We\u2019re presenting two of Ravel\u2019s most beloved works, the Piano Concerto in G major, and his elegant but sinister deconstruction of Vienna, La Valse. These follow Berlioz\u2019s high-octane Roman Carnival and Henri Dutilleux\u2019s smoky and sophisticated Métaboles (Metamorphoses). I\u2019m especially looking forward to welcoming fellow Belfast-man, pianist Michael McHale. We\u2019re the same age and grew up a few streets apart. This concerto is Michael\u2019s favourite \u2013 he\u2019s described the second movement as the only music he\u2019d need were he left on a desert island. I hope you\u2019ll join us in Jacoby Symphony Hall on Feb. 2, 3 and 4.\n\nFor more information about the Jacksonville Symphony concerts, visit jaxsymphony.org\n\nCourtney Lewis is music director of the Jacksonville Symphony.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Courtney Lewis"},"topics":[{"name":"Utilities news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Jacksonville news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Conducting Electricity: Little time for rest for a busy musician","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Duval","zipCode":"32202","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jacksonville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Florida Times-Union","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658140","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2142"},"name":"Florida Times-Union","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jacksonville.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203068701","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/field/image/1013330_web0_copy_lif_courtneylewismug.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\u201cMr. President, look at us,\u201d said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \u201cThis is America. What you have done is shameful. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \u201cWe are all immigrants!\u201d and \u201cNo ban! No wall!\u201d \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\u201d \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n \n\u201cThis executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \u201cPortland coffee comes from Yemen,\u201d one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n \nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \u201chashtag activist\u201d but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n \n\u201cThis was the last straw,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cWe\u2019re all immigrants.\u201d \n \nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n \nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey. \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"More protests against Trump\u2019s immigration policies planned","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Shawnee","zipCode":"66601","state":"Kansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Topeka","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Classic Hits 99.3 The Eagle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"489466366","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Classic Hits 99.3 The Eagle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Arts"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.eagle993.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/us-immigration-protests/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695203069818","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The statement describes the conversation as \" a congratulatory call\". \nThey discussed a wide range of global and international issues in a \"positive and business-like atmosphere\" and agreed to keep in touch, the Kremlin press service said. \nPutin and Trump also discussed restoring trade and economic ties, that could \"further stimulate consecutive and sustainable development of bilateral relations\". \nThe US President talked by phone with five foreign leaders on Saturday, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande.  \n \nAccording to the White House information, Trump and Merkel discussed policies toward Russia, as well as the role of NATO and possible ways to solve the crises in Ukraine and the Middle East.  \n \nDuring the conversation, Trump appeared to be reassuring Merkel of the US commitment to NATO, an organization he earlier described as \"obsolete\".  \n \nThe president and the chancellor also agreed on the NATO Alliance's fundamental importance to the broader transatlantic relationship and its role in ensuring the peace and stability of our North Atlantic community,\" the White House said in a statement.  \n \n\"In this vein, the leaders recognized that NATO must be capable of confronting 21st century threats and that our common defense requires appropriate investment in military capabilities to ensure all Allies are contributing their fair share to our collective security\".  \n \nThe allies also agreed to intensify efforts in the fight against terrorism and extremism and to work towards stabilizing the zones of conflict in North Africa and the Middle East.  \n \nTrump also accepted Merkel\u2019s invitation to attend the upcoming G20 summit in Hamburg in July, adding that he looked forward to seeing Merkel in Washington. \n \nSpeaking with the French President, Trump expressed readiness to strengthen US-French cooperation on a range of issues, including on security and anti-terrorism. The sides discussed military cooperation, both bilateral and within NATO.  \n \nThe presidents spoke highly of joint efforts, intended to defeat the ISIS and agreed to continue close coordination between Washington and Paris on issues of bilateral concern.  \n \nOther leaders Trump also spoke to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. With Abe Trump agreed to cooperate on the North Korean issue and discuss the matter in Washington on February 10. With Turnbull he discussed bilateral relations, which he described as important for maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.

But it has fallen foul of changing political priorities in its Polish home, and as it opened its doors for the first time Monday, it\u2019s facing an uncertain future. After nine years of work, the Museum of the Second World War opened in Gdansk for one day to reporters, historians, museum officials and Polish politicians. Director Pawel Machcewicz hoped the world could get a glimpse of it as he races against the clock to get it finished before he is pushed out of his job, something he believes is inevitable.\n\nThe project was launched in 2008 by then-Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who is today one of the European Union\u2019s top leaders. Aside from its global approach, the creators of the state museum say it is different from most other war museums in that it puts civilian suffering \u2014 not military campaigns \u2014 at the heart of the narrative.\n\nBut the political climate in Poland has changed dramatically since then, with a nationalist and populist government in charge that deeply objects to its approach and wants to take control over the institution to change its content. Members of the ruling Law and Justice party say they want a museum that focuses solely on the Polish experience, with primacy given to the heroism of Polish soldiers who resisted the Germans.\n\nMachcewicz is putting up a stiff opposition to the attempt to take over the museum, and is now in a legal battle with the Culture Ministry. A decision by a top court on Tuesday is expected to determine whether the museum can maintain its independence long enough to open to the public in late February, as scheduled. Machcewicz said the government is also withholding critical funds he needs to open the museum.\n\nAs a result, many of the displays were not yet in place Monday. But enough was there for viewers to get a sense of the immensely tragic story being told.\n\nOne object on display is a farewell note written on a handkerchief by a Polish politician, Boleslaw Wnuk, before he was executed in 1940 by the Germans in an operation that targeted the Polish intelligentsia.\n\n\u201cLet God pay for my blood with eternal damnation for the foul villains,\u201d said the note, which was smuggled out by a Polish prison guard.\n\nMuseum visitors learn that Wnuk\u2019s younger brother, Jakub, a pharmacist and army officer, became the victim of Poland\u2019s other wartime occupier, the Soviet Union. He was captured by the Soviet army in 1939 and killed in 1940 in Katyn, one of some 22,000 Polish officers killed in the Soviet massacres of Polish elites.\n\nWorld War II still holds a key place in the Polish national identity. There is huge pride at the fierce resistance put up by the Polish army to the German invasion of 1939 that launched the war and the years of underground resistance. There is also a sense that Poland\u2019s tragic fate, which included being occupied by the Germans and Soviets, has not been fully recognized by the world.\n\nAdding to the sense of grievance, Poland was condemned to the Soviet sphere despite its contribution to the Allied effort. So for Poland, the war didn\u2019t fully end until 1989, when the country regained its sovereignty, a message that is also stressed by the museum.\n\nThe nationalist authorities governing the country believe the museum should focus on the uniqueness of Poland\u2019s tragedy and not be watered down by exploring the fate of other nations. A key spokesman for this idea, historian Jan Zaryn, who is also a senator for the ruling party, complains that the multinational approach taken by the museum makes it \u201cmore difficult\u201d for the visitor to see \u201cour exceptionality.\u201d\n\nHe argues that Poland should create something comparable to what Holocaust museums have achieved for Jews.\n\n\u201cAfter decades of silence there should be a museum that introduces the phenomenon and specificity of the Polish historical experience,\u201d Zaryn said in a televised discussion last year. \u201cWe should do something like what the Jewish community has done, which managed to arrange around the Holocaust all the other events of World War II.\u201d\n\nBut museum supporters are doing what they can do defend it in its current form.\n\n\u201cSometimes when politicians look at the museum like this they don\u2019t understand how much conceptual work there was,\u201d said Yale historian Timothy Snyder, who is a member of the museum\u2019s advisory board.\n\n\u201cIf this museum is lost, Gdansk, Poland, Europe, the world, loses the only chance we have for an experience of public history, for people from all of the world, not only in Poland, to understand the Second World War. That would be a dreadful civilization lost.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Vanessa Gera"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Fate of Polish WWII museum unclear amid battle over history","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Duval","zipCode":"32202","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jacksonville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Florida Times-Union","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658140","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2142"},"name":"Florida Times-Union","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jacksonville.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203074474","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/field/image/985538_web0_copy_985538-ddea1c03c35348cdb3803b44584c9441.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

That\u2019s fitting for a man sometimes known as \u201cMr. Excitement,\u201d and it\u2019s a sign of respect, he says, for what\u2019s driven him for most of his 70-plus years on Earth. Singing.\n\nSinging since he was 5, when as a boy he regularly won talent shows sponsored by the Holsum Bread Company, which paid in bread. That came in handy at home in the Tampa projects.\n\nSinging at 12 years old, recording at Chess Records in Chicago, far from home.\n\nSinging at age 15, with his high-school buddies, in front of many thousands at the University of Florida, headlining the 1960 Gator Growl homecoming. That was a moment of history: Little Jake and the Blenders that day became the first black performers at the event, two years before the first black undergraduates were admitted to the university.\n\nSinging soul music through the 1960s in the black clubs known as the chitlin\u2019 circuit, and singing up in Detroit, where he cut a song called \u201cNot a Chance in a Million,\u201d 2:30 minutes of sublime, horn-driven soul. Singing that song, and others, in 2015, at a soul festival in England, where longtime fans from across Europe came to hear him. Still singing, in 2017, at 72 years old.\n\nNext stop: Feb. 4 at Mudville Music Room in Jacksonville, just miles away from the black clubs he used to play, places like Manuel\u2019s Tap Room and the 2 Spot, which became the Palms Ballroom. All gone now.\n\nOn a recent Thursday, his band, Little Jake and the Soul Searchers, crammed all eight members into a small studio near downtown Gainesville for its regular practice. Before the first song \u2014 a rip-roarer called \u201cCheaper to Keep Her\u201d \u2014 Mitchell just smiles when asked if he\u2019s lost a step.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost anything,\u201d he says. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got an increase.\u201d\n\nIndeed: Compare his decades-old version of \u201cNot a Chance in Million,\u201d found on Youtube, with the way he belts it out now, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s still got it.\n\nHe\u2019s the real deal, says Delorean Fullington, an accomplished bass player finishing up a master\u2019s degree in music performance at UF. He popped into the studio soon after the Soul Searchers\u2019 rehearsal started, just because he likes the band, and was soon smiling and applauding.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t do this anymore,\u201d Fullington says. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t sing like this anymore.\u201d\n\nAdrian Croasdell is promoter of the Cleethorpes Northern Soul Weekender festival in England, a gathering of lovers of mid-1960s American soul music. He hired Mitchell for the 2015 event, and said fans came from Spain, Germany, France and Italy.\n\nBy email, Croasdell said Mitchell is well-remembered by English soul fans, largely by the stage name \u2014 Jock Mitchell \u2014 that he performed under for a while.\n\n\u201cHis record \u2018Not a Chance in a Million\u2019 on Impact Records out of Detroit in 1967 is considered one of the best examples of the music us British soul fans love,\u201d Croasdell said. \u201cIt is a great dance record for our music scene, (and) gets regular play at discotheques all over the country where rare \u201960s and \u201970s soul music is played.\u201d\n\nMitchell made many records, and ran his own record company, Golden Hit Productions, in Detroit. He had a couple of nightclubs there. Yet the music industry is tough. It\u2019s grinding.\n\nIn the mid-\u201970s, he left music and and followed his other love, cooking. He was chef for 13 years at University of Bridgeport in Connecticut, making a regular living to support his children.\n\nHe was happy enough doing that, he says. But he sang all the time as he cooked. And he kept this in mind: \u201cI knew I was going to put the knife down and make music again.\u201d\n\n\u2018Everybody was happy\u2019\n\nLittle Jake\u2019s discovery story goes like this:\n\nHe was born in Tampa in 1944 and named Arnold Rodriguez; his mother, Thelma, was a Cuban-American and changed his last name to Mitchell when she later married (an aunt nicknamed him \u201cJake,\u201d which stuck).\n\nHe was always singing, and he was singing while hanging out at Sweetwater Poultry Market when the business\u2019 owner, Henry Urso, called on the telephone to check in. Columbus Warren, who ran the place, picked up the phone.\n\nWho\u2019s that singing? Urso asked. Why, that\u2019s Miss Thelma\u2019s son, Jake, Warren said. Hold him until I get there, Urso said.\n\nWithin hours Urso signed on to manage Little Jake\u2019s career, and took him to downtown Tampa to buy his first suit, a red one.\n\nWhile he was still 12, Jake spent time at legendary Chess Records \u2014 home to Chuck Berry, among others \u2014 recording tracks. A management dispute messed that up, but soon young Jake was spending summers on a bus, barnstorming with other musicians from performance to performance across the South, Northeast and Midwest.\n\nFor high school, he moved to Gainesville and formed Little Jake and the Blenders: Four boys from the choir at all-black Lincoln High singing backup, with Jake on lead vocals. Soon they were busy every Friday and Saturday night of the school year singing at sweaty fraternity parties and fancy sorority gatherings at UF, backed by a band of white college students called the Pyramids.\n\nIt had certain advantages. Girls liked them. And the money was good, for teenagers. Teachers, paid next to nothing, even hit them up for loans.\n\nThe college kids, who were all white, loved the band, and asked Jake to headline Gator Growl in 1960. He said he would, as long as blacks were allowed in for the performance.\n\n\u201dTo have that much chutzpah, to do that, at that age?\u201d says Charles Steadham, 72, saxophone player and band leader of the Soul Searchers, and one of the few white musicians who played on the chitlin\u2019 circuit.\n\nThe university agreed, and 10,000 bleacher seats were set up for blacks in the south end zone of Florida Field. And after entertainment such as \u201cWish Upon a Genie\u201d by Kappa Delta and selections from \u201cAnnie Get Your Gun,\u201d Little Jake and the Blenders took the stage.\n\nBy that point, music lovers weren\u2019t staying in those south end zone bleachers, Jake recalls, and nobody seemed to mind. \u201cPeople started sitting everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody was happy.\u201d\n\nFifty years later, a few years after Mitchell moved back home to Gainesville, the city proclaimed May 6, 2010 as Little Jake Day, marking the events of that Gator Growl.\n\nHe\u2019s proud of the part he played in that. But he figures that music is what really made it happen: Music is something that can bring people together, he likes to say, and it probably had a big impact on what would follow in the decades to come.\n\nHe saw that as he toured with B.B. King and Marvin Gaye and countless others, well-known and obscure, as music began to break down barriers that had stood for a long time.\n\n\u201cWhite people wanted to hear our music. They wanted to dance to our music. They wanted to see entertainers. The next thing you know, black and white are singing together, recording together, doing shows together,\u201d Little Jake says. \u201cYou see? It was destined to happen.\u201d\n\nMatt Soergel: (904) 359-4082\n\nLittle Jake and the Soul Searchers\n\n7 p.m. Saturday at Mudville Listening Room, 3105 Beach Blvd.\n\n$15-$20 Read/post comments","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Soergel"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Tampa Bay Area news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"At 72, Little Jake is still singing sweet soul music","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Duval","zipCode":"32202","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jacksonville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Florida Times-Union","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658140","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2142"},"name":"Florida Times-Union","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jacksonville.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203075622","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/field/image/841106_web0_JAX_011217_LEADLittleJake.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Part of \u201cMoonlight\u201d was shot in Jimmy\u2019s Eastside Diner in Miami. Scenic spots around Los Angeles featured in \u201cLa La Land\u201d included the Hermosa Beach Pier. And in Pittsburgh, \u201cFences\u201d was filmed in a house that perfectly evokes playwright \u201cAugust Wilson\u2019s world,\u201d according to his widow.\n\nOther movies with connections to real places include \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d filmed in coastal towns near Boston, and \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d about African-American women who worked for NASA in Virginia, where several attractions may be of interest to fans.\n\nHere are some details.\n\n\u2018LA LA LAND\u2019\n\nThis musical love letter to Los Angeles includes shots of many recognizable destinations around the city. Among them: Griffith Observatory, the Hermosa Beach Pier and nearby Lighthouse Cafe, the Hollywood Walk of Fame mural, Angels Flight Railway, Grand Central Market and the Smoke House restaurant. There\u2019s even a scene staged amid traffic on a freeway overpass.\n\n\u2018MOONLIGHT\u2019\n\nMuch of this story of a young black man coming of age was set and shot in and around Miami\u2019s Liberty Square housing project. One of the most tender scenes depicts the protagonist as a child being taught to swim by a drug dealer who serves as a father figure. That scene was shot on Virginia Key beach, a black-only beach during the segregation era on the Rickenbacker Causeway that connects mainland Miami to Key Biscayne.\n\n\u201cMoonlight\u201d is structured in three parts. The final segment centers on a reunion shot in a real restaurant, Jimmy\u2019s Eastside Diner, where fans can grab breakfast or lunch.\n\n\u2018FENCES\u2019\n\n\u201cFences,\u201d a movie adapted from the August Wilson play, was set and shot in Wilson\u2019s hometown, Pittsburgh. Many of the scenes were filmed in a small brick house at 809 Anaheim St. Wilson\u2019s widow, Constanza Romero, visited the house, escorted by the film\u2019s star and director, Denzel Washington, and told The Associated Press that she felt like she was \u201cinside August Wilson\u2019s world \u2026 It was just such a feeling that August\u2019s words had become three-dimensional.\u201d Wilson\u2019s actual childhood home, is about 2 miles away at 1727 Bedford Ave., and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nFans will also want to visit the August Wilson Center, a multi-use performing arts center in Pittsburgh with a theater, art galleries and more. An exhibit with video interviews, costumes and props from the movie runs Jan. 28-March 10. The Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation publishes a guidebook called \u201cAugust Wilson: Pittsburgh Places in His Life and Plays\u201d and various walking tours are available of the city\u2019s historically African-American Hill District.\n\n\u2018HIDDEN FIGURES\u2019\n\nThis movie tells the story of African-American women who worked at NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, in the early 1960s. Their work helped put John Glenn into orbit. The movie was mostly filmed in Atlanta, but Hampton offers several attractions worth visiting.\n\nA new exhibit called \u201cWhen the Computer Wore a Skirt: NASA\u2019s Human Computers\u201d just opened at the Hampton History Museum. Fans can also learn more about the work done at Langley at the Virginia Air & Space Center, which is hosting a talk by Margot Lee Shetterly, author of the book \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d on March 7 at 7:30 p.m. EST. A bench dedicated to one of the women featured in the movie, Katherine Johnson, is located directly across from the Air & Space Center in Carousel Park.\n\n\u2018MANCHESTER BY THE SEA\u2019\n\nThe movie was filmed in parts of Cape Ann and the North Shore of Massachusetts. Gloucester served as the backdrop for a number of scenes, including the pivotal tear-jerking scene between Michelle Williams and Casey Affleck. Central Street in downtown Manchester was also in the film, and cemetery scenes were filmed in the Rosedale cemetery. Local spots like the Willow Rest on Holly Street in Gloucester and Fibber McGee\u2019s in Beverly also figure in the movie locations.\n\n\u2018HELL OR HIGH WATER\u2019\n\nThis movie is set in West Texas but was filmed in New Mexico. Bank robbery scenes were shot in Clovis and Portales, and Quay County\u2019s Caprock Escarpment also makes an appearance along with spots in Moriarty and Tucumcari.\n\nThe Route 66 Casino Hotel in Albuquerque was among the locations.\n\n\u201820TH CENTURY WOMEN\u2019\n\nThis movie about a mother and her teenage son set in 1979 included many locations in the Santa Barbara, California area. Among them: East Beach, West Beach, Miramar Beach and Ganna Walska Lotusland garden and historic estate in Montecito. An area near Gaviota Pier at Gaviota State Park, with a scene driving through the Gaviota Tunnel on Highway 101, was also included.\n\nSkateboarding scenes were shot on Ashley Road at East Mountain Drive and San Leandro Lane near Crane School in Montecito.\n\n\u2018FANTASTIC BEASTS\u2019\n\nThis magical romp through 1920s New York City shows many famous landmarks, including the Woolworth Building and the Statue of Liberty. But many of the places shown in the film look very different today, including Times Square, the Central Park Zoo and the Lower East Side.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Beth J.

That is to be truly free.\u201d as he stressed his statement. \n \n\u201cHappiness with a health body and a health mind is almost what everyone wishes to possess,\u201d as the Zen master clarified, \u201cHigh conscious intelligence, from Healing to Health with Harmony and Happiness penetrates and permeates into all the communities of Zen world, further prevailing into all conscious beings around the globe.\u201d \n \nAccording to DeRu, Zen sees one conscious world, and one conscious being with one breath and one source of origin, from nothing to everything, expanding to apparent visible world as one sees with naked eye. However; the invisible potentiality is unlimited and infinite. The high conscious intelligence continues its path to infinite potentiality to everlasting-limitless universe. \n \nDeRu further explained: \"Zen sees the reality of potentiality is in the emptiness within and between the visible worlds. It is that emptiness of potentiality makes the universe going with consistent and constant expanding in infinity.\" \n \nThis is how the Zen Master sees the world, \"The high conscious mind of the universe guides and decides the direction of the universe expansion and development. When one follows the heart of the high conscious universe, one believes and achieves one\u2019s dream with unwavering faith and confidence. One will eventually be intotal communication and merge with that of infinite oneness.\" \n \n\u201cIt is that Zen mind propagates and instigates Imagination which opens the 3rd eye to vision the infinite Potentiality of the true reality of the universe.\" according to DeRu. \u201cWe are all part of, and microcosm of the universe. Our body particles are universal participles and our atoms are part of the universe atoms. Our conscious Qi waves are closely connected with the Qi waves of the universe consciousness which set the parameter to guide each step of our path if we wish to discover within the happiness and health.\u201d \n \nZen philosophy along with Zen way of living has been in lead in high conscious living beings for thousands of years. Zen Master DeRu sees Quantum theory along with scientific experiment of quantum physics gives lights, like taking many pictorial shots of reality of the world, to ordinary conscious beings, believers and non believers alike to observe and see the truth of the world, and the conscious universe in communication and expansion with unlimited potentiality without time or space limitations. \n \nDeRu firmly believes, \"In that Zen world one begins to see, In lieu of the fittest and fiercest fight for victory and survival with competitiveness from the selected few, humanity leading all conscious beings together claim victory by synergy and cooperation with compassion and love.\u201d \n \nDeRu maintains, \"war and fierce competition is for ignorant self-serving few, leading to self-destruction, it is, he said, the synergy in peace with harmony in cooperation leading all beings to greater development in advancement of conscious beings.\" \n \n\"Leaving Newton as a hero of the past,\" he insists, \"we must move on, following vision of the Ancient Chan in all conscious, subconscious and superconscious communication, human beings shall explore further. seeing beyond and through that visible illusionary world into that true universe intelligence and wisdom, and see the true potential world beyond time and space with the guidance of Albert Einstein, Max Planck and Niels Bohr\u2019s scientific minds.\" \n \nMaster Shi DeRu a 31 generation Shaolin Chan (Zen) Master has been teaching Living Zen Mind and Zen meditation with TaGong for over three decades worldwide, especially in China and the US. \n \nHe has been hosting his Annual Qi Retreat in the US for the last two decades with various theme topics on health and happy living.

The broadcast continues to air his messages, starting in 1969. \n\nUnder Dr. Boice, Tenth Presbyterian Church became a model for evangelical ministry in America's cities. He also gave leadership to groups beyond his own church and organization, including the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy and Bible Study Fellowship. \n\nHe also founded and chaired an annual lay theology conference, Philadelphia Conference on Reformation Theology, which has run continuously for 28 years and has brought in-depth study of major biblical doctrines to thousands of people. \n\nIn 1994 Dr. Boice joined with other evangelical leaders in founding the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals, which in 1996 sponsored a Summit meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts, of more than 100 evangelical leaders. Out of that meeting came \"The Cambridge Declaration,\" a document calling Christians to repent of their cultural worldliness and to recover the great salvation doctrines of the Bible as the Reformers did in the sixteenth century. This organization now produces The Bible Study Hour, Modern Reformation and God's Word Today magazines, and sponsors many conferences and seminars. \n\nA prolific author, Dr. Boice wrote or contributed to over sixty books on a wide variety of biblical and theological themes. His 4-volume commentary on Romans was named one of the best books of the twentieth century. Other popular titles include Standing on the Rock, The Parables of Jesus, The Christ of Christmas, Christ's Call to Discipleship... \n\nDr. Boice held degrees from Harvard University (A.B.), Princeton Theological Seminary (B.D.), the University of Basel, Switzerland (D. Theol.) and the Theological Seminary of the Reformed Episcopal Church (D.D., honorary).","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Wrong Path and Its Consequences The Bible Study Hour with Dr. James Boice","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"One Place.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"184610734","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"68"},"name":"One Place.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard","Religion"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.oneplace.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203088832","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

For instance, it was alarming that the Nigeria Police Force (NPF), during an interactive session in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, expressed concern over the rising cases of suicide among its officers. \n \nAgainst this background, the insightful picture by a psychiatrist at the Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital, Yaba (FNPHY), Lagos, Dr. Bolanle Ajayi, deserves attention: \u201cThe high cases of depressive illnesses are no doubt as a result of the economic recession and a lot of people are being affected. Even in our hospital wards now, we see a lot of people coming down with depressive illness, suicide, and depression, deliberate self-harm and by the time we look at the primary cause of these illnesses, it was actually this recession going on.\u201d Ajayi was quoted as saying that many Nigerians are psychologically, socially and emotionally affected by the recession. \n \nStatistically speaking, the figures indeed suggest that more Nigerians are experiencing mental challenges that may not be unconnected with the country\u2019s unfavourable economic situation. For example, FNPHY recorded 59 per cent increase in the number of new patients in the first 11 months of 2016.  Between January and November 2016, patient attendance at the health institution reportedly reached 53, 287 compared with 25,267 for the same period in 2015. \n \nA report said: \u201cMore women than men appeared to be seeking help for psychiatric illnesses because during the period in question, the number of female patients increased 135 per cent from 13,730 to 32,261, compared with an increase of 82 per cent from 11,537 to 21,026, for male patients.\u201d \n \nIt continued: \u201cThe number of new patients in the hospital increased from 2,531 to 4,031. Of the new patients, 2,001 were male representing 53 per cent increase over the 1,306 recorded last year, while 2,030 were female, a 66 per cent increase over the previous year. In absolute figures, there was an overall 46 per cent increase in number of admissions in 2016 (867) compared with 594 in 2015, while the community clinic attendance went up from 1,793 to 3,510, a 95 per cent increase.\u201d \n \nMore disturbing is the information that more children were also mentally challenged in the period under focus: \u201cEven children were not spared as there was a 144 per cent increase in the number of child/adolescent clinic attendance from 1,375 to 3,355. This comprised a 141 per cent increase of girls from 2,311 to 5,581, and 138 per cent increase for boys, from 936 to 2,226. Also, the number of follow-up patients increased 74 per cent from 19,889 (9,076 male and 10,813 female) to 34,536 (11,608 male and 22,928 female).\u201d \n \nThe increased psychiatric consultations and hospitalisations reportedly  resulting from the country\u2019s worsening economic crisis have been attributed to significant stressors, including loss of livelihood, depleted financial income, reduced purchasing power and lack of savings which are putting a strain on  individual, familial and group relationships. It is said that the effect of the recession is more pronounced in low-income families, making them increasingly unable to meet their basic needs such as food, security, transportation, healthcare and shelter. This leads to problems of anxiety, lowered self-esteem and other emotional/behavioural difficulties, which may further lead to suicidal thoughts and suicidal action. \n \nResearch has shown a nexus between poverty and mental breakdown, which must not be ignored, considering the lamentable enabling conditions created by the country\u2019s recession. Dr. Ajayi was quoted as saying that depressive disorder, an extreme form of sadness, could result in loss of sleep and inability to function properly. She said: \u201cPeople suffering this form of mental disorder do not have interest in previous pleasurable exercise. Sometimes, they may even want to commit suicide or write suicide notes.\u201d \n \nShe added: \u201cVirtually all kinds of pressures lead to one sickness or another. When someone has mental illness, and wants to buy medication and he/she cannot afford it, he gets home and somebody provokes him, things like that affect people in the long run. Take for instance in our hospital now, many of our patients on treatment are no longer coming either due to money for transportation or they are not able to pay for their treatment. Some new patients now find it difficult to pay for their files. All these contribute to the increase in mental cases.\u201d \n \nIt is bad enough that the country is going through hard times; it is terrible that more and more people are breaking down with psychiatric illness and going through suicide-provoking situations as a result. \n \nCollapsing social values and weakened social structures may well further complicate the complication, but the reality is that people need pro-life and pro-sanity environments to cope in recession. \n  Share this","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Mental malady \u2013 The Nation","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"CitizenNG.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"533853821","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"CitizenNG.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://thecitizenng.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203091058","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:35:02Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Good protective measures could do all lots of good \n \nThe National Parent-Teacher Association of Nigeria and allied bodies recently sought audience with President Muhammadu Buhari to discuss with him what is becoming a disturbing phenomenon: kidnapping of pupils and students from the premises of their schools by sundry criminal gangs. \n \nThe demand was prompted by the recent vicious attack of some criminals on an elite school, Nigerian Tulip International College, in Ogun State. Some armed men had invaded the school and seized five members of staff and three students. Two days after the abduction, the kidnappers asked for a hefty ransom of N1.2 billion, an amount they later slashed to N750 million. The whereabouts of all the abductees \u2013 all females \u2013 were unknown for several days until they gained freedom last week after what must have been a most traumatic experience for them and their families. \n \nUnfortunately, that was not an isolated incident as many of the nation\u2019s secondary schools are increasingly under siege as criminal gangs increasingly render them unsafe for studies. Repeated attacks on schools have also created fear in many vulnerable students, especially in some sections of the country. \u201cWhen a school is under attack and students become targets\u201d, said Manuel Fotaine, West Africa Regional Director of United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), \u201cnot only are their lives shattered, the future of the nation is stolen.\u201d \n \nRegrettably, this has become our lot in Nigeria today. Last March, three pupils of Babinton Macaulay Junior Seminary, Ikorodu, Lagos, were abducted in a commando-like operation just as four pupils and two teachers of Lagos State Model College, Epe, Lagos, were seized six months later in October. In between these, so many schools were raided by bandits across the country, seizing, harassing and collecting ransoms. \n \nIn the North-east where the brutal insurgent group Boko Haram operated with impunity for years, some 200 schools were reportedly burnt in the course of their futile campaigns to establish a caliphate. Indeed, violence and instability in the schools only helped their ignoble cause since, by their philosophy, \u201cwestern education is sinful.\u201d Their attack on Federal Government College, Buni Yadi, Yobe State on February 25, 2014, where some 51 students were murdered was designed to instil fear in the minds of the children and their teachers and to discourage the parents from sending their wards to school. Even more audacious was the abduction, on April 14, 2014, of 276 schoolgirls from their hostels in Chibok, an action which prompted the catchy hashtag, BringBackOurGirls. Although 57 of the girls later escaped and 21 have been released through negotiation, some 195 of the girls are still in captivity. \n \nThe spate of kidnappings has prompted many to look out for ways of safeguarding students from physical threats and generally making the schools safe for study. The Safe Schools Initiative launched in 2014 after the Chibok kidnap, was meant to counter the growing attacks on the right to education and to build community security groups to promote safe zones for education, consisting of teachers, parents, police and community leaders. \u201cWe cannot stand by and see schools shut down, girls cut off from their education and parents in fear of their daughters\u2019 lives,\u201d said former British Prime Minister, Mr. Gordon Brown, then UN Special Envoy on Education at the launch. \u201cThe Safe School Initiative will put Nigeria on track to help more and more girls and boys go to school and learn.\u201d \n \nSadly, the idea has long been abandoned and the schools left to their individual devices. But all indicators suggest the threat to schools is not about to flag. What\u2019s more, many elite schools, including a good number of federal government colleges, are located in rural areas and many are without perimeter fencing, making them easy targets at a time the security agencies are stretched. Besides fending for their security in time of recession, the schools may not have many alternatives than to build partnerships with the authorities as espoused in the safe school initiative. \n  Share this","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Securing schools for our children \u2013 Thisday","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"CitizenNG.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"533853821","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"CitizenNG.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://thecitizenng.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203091557","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:35:09Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\u201cMr. President, look at us,\u201d said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \u201cThis is America. What you have done is shameful. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \u201cWe are all immigrants!\u201d and \u201cNo ban! No wall!\u201d \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\u201d \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n \n\u201cThis executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \u201cPortland coffee comes from Yemen,\u201d one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n \nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \u201chashtag activist\u201d but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n \n\u201cThis was the last straw,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cWe\u2019re all immigrants.\u201d \n \nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n \nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey. \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"More protests against Trump\u2019s immigration policies planned","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cook","zipCode":"60601","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Chicago","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WLS-AM","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"187813487","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"221"},"name":"WLS-AM","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlsam.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/us-immigration-protests/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695203091729","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But she also busies herself with a host of other activities \u2014 education, commissioning, audience development \u2014 that help ensure a place for the musical tradition through generations to come. \n \nIt was those activities that brought her to the Marin Veterans\u2019 Memorial Auditorium in San Rafael in the first place. Each year Midori spends a week in residency with a regional orchestra, coaching its youth ensembles, making school visits and leading educational workshops, and this year the Marin Symphony was the beneficiary of her largesse. \n \nOn Friday, Midori\u2019s behind-the-scenes activities were conveyed to the audience through a short video, but the sheer musical impact of her presence was evident in the performance of Britten\u2019s Violin Concerto that she gave with Music Director Alasdair Neale and the orchestra. \n \nThis early masterpiece, written when the composer was in his mid-20s, has for too long been a relatively overlooked jewel. Fortunately, the piece has begun to regain some of its appeal to performers, and Midori\u2019s rendition \u2014 vivacious, expressive and full of judiciously chosen interpretive points \u2014 was a good reminder why. \n \nFor one thing, Britten\u2019s work is a wonderful combination of the traditional and the wildly unconventional, in both its details and its large-scale rhetoric. The thematic material sounds graspable enough, except that it never quite goes where you expect; there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for virtuoso display from the soloist without making that subordinate to the overall musical argument; and the finale, a broad passacaglia in a tenderly elegiac vein, more or less comes out of nowhere. \n \nMidori and Neale collaborated on a performance that found an optimal balance among all these forces. She brought eloquence and energy to the opening government, a sense of concentrated urgency to the big cadenza, and unruffled nobility to the finale. Neale and the orchestra supported her with full-voiced, detailed playing. \n \nThe orchestra sounded just as focused on its own, beginning with the buoyant rhythms and crackling instrumental textures of Mason Bates\u2019 exuberant curtain-raiser \u201cDevil\u2019s Radio.\u201d Written in 2014 for the Sun Valley Summer Symphony, the annual festival that Neale runs in the mountains of Idaho, it\u2019s a sampler of Bates\u2019 most supple and crackling musical ideas, and the orchestra dispatched it without a hitch. \n \nFor even more ensemble display, there was Bartók\u2019s Concerto for Orchestra, which occupied the second half of the program in a muscular, finely blended account. \n \nNeale proved particularly adept at mustering big orchestral textures in the outer movements, although the streamlined writing in the even-numbered movements also elicited strong solos from several of the players. \n \nJoshua Kosman is The San Francisco Chronicle\u2019s music critic.

Ringing a national radio station after the midweek defeat by Southampton, he called for Jurgen Klopp to be sacked. \n \nWith an accent that sounded more Thames Estuary than Scouse, it was difficult to know if it was a gigantic wind-up. \n \n\u201cHe\u2019s not a trophy-winning manager,\u201d said Dave, overlooking the two Bundesliga titles Klopp ­secured with Borussia Dortmund. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve not won a game in January,\u201d he went on, ignoring the fact that the month isn\u2019t out. And that the Reds eventually triumphed over Plymouth Argyle in the FA Cup. \n \n\u201cEverton are going to be overtaking us at this rate,\u201d was another barb. The difference at present is nine points. Ten if you count goal difference. \n    Jurgen Klopp looks on  (Photo: Liverpool Echo)     Liverpool players react against Wolves  (Photo: Liverpool Echo)  \nDave was also brassed off that Klopp hadn\u2019t moved to replace Sadio Mane who disappeared on Africa Cup Of Nations duty, the claims of Daniel Sturridge and Divock Origi discarded like a used tissue. What did he want? To sign Cristiano Ronaldo on a one-month loan deal? \n \nBut in giving Dave the benefit of the doubt that he was more a sore loser than deranged, there was one point which resonated loud and clear. \n \n\u201cHe\u2019s not sorted out the defence,\u201d \u2013 one whine that hasn\u2019t dulled with age. \n \nAnd while we can find more holes in Dave\u2019s rant than there are in Klopp\u2019s defence, he does have a valid argument. \n    Stearman heads Wolves in front  (Photo: Alex Livesey)     The defender celebrates his goal  (Photo: )  \nThis core problem eventually did for Brendan Rodgers. And the way it\u2019s going, it looks like being the German\u2019s Achilles heel too. His backline looked exposed again in the FA Cup defeat to Championship Wolves. \n \nStatistics can prove anything. But while Liverpool are the Premier League\u2019s top goal-­scorers, only one side in the top eight has a worse defensive record. Yes, that\u2019s you, Manchester City. \n \nThe manager decided Simon Mignolet wasn\u2019t up to scratch so he brought in his own man \u2013 but the credentials of the erratic Loris Karius are already under fierce ­scrutiny. \n    Weimann rounds Karius to score  (Photo: Action Images via Reuters)     Weimann celebrates after scoring  (Photo: Alex Livesey)  \nAt the back, Dejan Lovren has as many friends as enemies. On his day he looks a million dollars. Trouble is, no one can predict when those days will be. \n \nRagnar Klavan was brought in last summer. But why, if the centre-back was so good, didn\u2019t other German clubs try to whip him away from Bundesliga side Augsburg.­ \n \nThen we have the mysterious case of Alberto Moreno \u2013 and the most damaging evidence against Klopp. Liverpool\u2019s boss had much of last season plus a pre-season to lick the left-back into shape. \n     \n\n  Video Loading  \nVideo Unavailable \n   \nClick to play  Tap to play \n   The video will start in 8 Cancel  \nPlay now \n     \nWatch this video again \n Watch Next   \nVideo will play in  \n  Jurgen Klopp speaks after Liverpool's 2-1 FA Cup loss to Wolves    Share this video     Watch Next      \nEven part-timers such as myself can see that the defender loves charging forward like a manic Spanish bull. But he is not so keen on returning home. \n \nWhy wasn\u2019t Moreno pulled to one side and ­reminded of his responsibilities? It\u2019s not a difficult one to solve. \n \nThe very best left-backs such as Ashley Cole were defenders first and foremost. But they knew when to leave their slot. They were discerning. \n \nThe Arsenal and Chelsea man didn\u2019t just think to himself \u2018I\u2019m off\u2019 whenever his side were in possession. \n    Moreno hasn't done enough  (Photo: Andrew Powell)     Liverpool's players trudge off  (Photo: Alex Livesey)  \nIn fairness, James Milner has performed well at left-back but he was never schooled in that ­position.

William Odom and Deputy Tyler Urquhart will have received since September when the pair saved a woman\u2019s life after her vehicle collided with a tractor-trailer and began burning. \n   \nOn Sunday, Sept. 25, Urquhart and Odom were parked in their patrol vehicles near the Interstate 95 and U.S. 52 interchange. It was around 11:30 p.m. when the men heard a call about a collision on northbound I-95 involving a passenger vehicle that had rear-ended an 18-wheeler. \n   \n\u201cWe just happened to be two and a half three minutes out,\u201d Urquhart said. \u201cWhen we came up the hill on I-95, that\u2019s when you could see it. The car was wedged underneath the trailer and was starting to catch on fire.\u201d \n   \nUrquhart was in the southbound lanes when he saw the crash scene and knew he didn\u2019t have time to double back, so he parked his patrol car and ran across the median. Odom arrived at the same time as Urquhart and both saw the driver was still trapped in the burning vehicle. \n   \nOdom grabbed a fire extinguisher from the driver of the tractor-trailer while Urquhart searched for a way inside the burning vehicle. As Urquhart broke the rear driver-side window, Odom fought the flames, trying to keep them away from the driver, who was struggling to free herself. \n   \n\u201cThe driver\u2019s door was pinned so we couldn\u2019t get it open,\u201d Urquhart said. \u201cWe had to bust the back glass out and then I reached in there and open the door. I reached in to lower her seat. Everything slowed down at that point.\u201d \n   \n\u201cThe fire was coming into the driver\u2019s compartment. I just kept knocking it down, trying to keep it down,\u201d Odom said. \u201cThen we had the 18-wheeler tire that was on fire and I said, \u201cIf one of them blows it\u2019s going to throw fire all over us.\u2019 It was a mess.\u201d \n   \nThe deputies were able to free the woman just moments before both her vehicle and the tractor-trailer were engulfed in flames. \n   \n\u201cAll I could think was two more minutes,\u201d Odom said. \u201cLet\u2019s say we weren\u2019t at 95 and 52 or if we would\u2019ve went down and doubled back, there\u2019s no way she\u2019d have made it.\u201d \n   \nThe woman survived but suffered serious injuries during the crash. She was taken to a hospital, where she was treated and released. Neither of the men knows what the ultimate cause of the wreck was. \n   \nThe deputies haven\u2019t heard from the victim herself since the crash, but said they have been contacted by her family members, who praised them for their bravery and expressed their unending gratitude for their life-saving actions. \n   \n\u201cHer daughter sent me a message on Facebook and thanked me,\u201d Odom said. \u201cIt means a lot. It feels good to be appreciated. It keeps you motivated to get out here and keep working hard.\u201d \n   \n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to both her daughters,\u201d Urquhart said. \u201cThat was the most encouraging part of all of it, the family reaching out. That\u2019s when things start to sink in that you really made a difference.\u201d \n   \nThe men have received multiple awards and recognition for their heroism including a resolution of appreciation by the Florence County Council and two Medal of Valor awards: one from the state sheriff\u2019s association and the other from the state law enforcement association. Media outlets from across the state reported their story. But the deputies don\u2019t see themselves as heroes at all. \n   \nFor Urquhart, the recognition and publicity are not something he expected or wanted. Urquhart said he was just doing his job. \n   \n\u201c\u201cIt\u2019s nice to get a good job every now and then but this is overwhelming to say the least,\u201d Urquhart said. \u201cEverybody gets that once in a lifetime opportunity and this was it.\u201d \n   \nFor Odom, saving a life just creates a deeper passion for his career as a law enforcement officer. \n   \n\u201cYou don\u2019t forget it,\u201d Odom said. \u201cIt makes you love your job more and appreciate it. \n   \n\u201cWhen you save a life, it makes everything worthwhile.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JESSICA IMBIMBO Morning News Jimbimbo@florencenews.com"},"topics":[],"title":"Lifesaving bravery: Florence County deputies receive Medal of Valor","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Florence","zipCode":"29501","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Florence","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"SC Now","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169677639","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"SC Now","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.scnow.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203098628","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/scnow.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/da/ada7583a-e5ae-11e6-924c-075bb1810918/588d24aac9cd6.preview.jpg?resize=300%2C224"}],"video":[]}}

Over the next five years the city will focus on community health and livability, financial stability, organizational development and cultural change. \n   \nCity Manager Drew Griffin Drew Griffin said the plan is essentially the city\u2019s public policy bible, providing a basis for everything the city does. \n   \n\u201cIt talks about the direction of the city on a number of fronts. It\u2019s the basis for why we do the things we do,\u201d he said. \u201c\u201cOf course, a comp-plan should always be subject to amendments and changes. If we\u2019re not changing it as we go, we\u2019re probably not paying attention to it as much as we should be. \u201c \n   \nThe plan was done with the help of Kending Keast Collaborative, city planning group, and used community interviews and views from business people. \n   \nSome of the actions city could take include changing the \u201cbrand of the city, creating better-quality housing and building codes in blighted neighborhoods, growth through annexation and revamping existing city parks and recreation areas. \n   \nFlorence Mayor Pro Tempore Buddy Brand said Florence sets the precedent for growth across the entire Pee Dee Region, so continuing the pattern of growth and revitalization is crucial. \n   \n\u201cThis is bigger than Florence,\u201d Brand said. \u201cPlaces like Marion, Darlington, Lake City, Timmonsville, and others, all depend of Florence to thrive. It\u2019s up to us a city to make ourselves viable because many of the surrounding Pee Dee cities aren\u2019t thriving right now. If we don\u2019t continue this growth we\u2019re not only letting Florence taxpayers down but we\u2019re also letting the entire Pee Dee down.\u201d \n  \n Downtown renaissance  \n  \nFlorence\u2019s downtown area has seen a boom in public and private investment, leading to continuing construction. That trend will continue over the next five years. \n   \n\u201cThere\u2019s a balance that we have to have between our neighborhoods and downtown, and those two are dependent upon each other. \n   \n\u201cIn the first few years of this downtown plan, the general sense was excitement but cautious optimism,\u201d said Florence Mayor Stephen J. Wukela. \u201cI dare say that we have turned the corner. The success that\u2019s been made downtown is not going to fail. The question now is what will it become and the question now is what can we springboard from this?\u201d \n   \nSome of the city\u2019s long-term plans in downtown include identifying spaces for a mid-size grocery store, opening a fresh food marketplace and having 200 more housing units available in the area by 2021. \n   \nThe council was on board with continued downtown growth but wanted ensure the development was proportionate to neighborhood redevelopment. \n   \n\u201cThe hub of downtown is running well but we have to go north, across the tracks toward Darlington Street,\u201d said Councilwoman Pat Gibson-Hye Moore. \u201cWe\u2019re headed that way but we have to keep going if we\u2019re really revitalizing downtown. Some other parts of downtown have become sustainable and we have to make sure we get there in that northern part.\u201d \n   \nCouncilwoman Teresa Meyers-Ervin agreed and said that as growth continues, so should the relationships with minority business that have been in that area for decades. \n   \n\u201cWhen I think commercial, I think Dargan Street,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to foster the relationships with longstanding minority businesses already there. We need to continue pressing that way and focus on these types of relationships in downtown.\u201d \n   \nRay Reich, the downtown development manager, said a key to prolonged downtown growth will be bringing travelers into downtown from the interstates. \n   \n\u201cRight now a relatively small percentage of traveler come off 95 or 20 into our downtown,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout 72,000 cars pass through daily on the interstates, and if we can capture even a small percentage of that number and bring them downtown area, that would be a huge plus for economic stability and growth.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JOSHUA LLOYD Morning News jlloyd@florencenews.com"},"topics":[],"title":"City of Florence Council updates comprehensive plan, shifts focus","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Florence","zipCode":"29501","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Florence","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"SC Now","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169677639","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"SC Now","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.scnow.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203098811","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/scnow.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/a4/1a435f60-cfa8-11e6-a270-475359761030/588d217572308.preview.jpg?resize=300%2C224"}],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

Qantas is offering refunds to any passengers travelling from Australia to the United States who are affected by a new entry ban. Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days.

It captured a perfect snapshot of the darker end of youth culture in 1996, launched the now-stellar careers of Danny Boyle and Ewan MacGregor, and gave a massive shot in the arm to the British film industry. While a sequel has long been mooted, the idea has always been viewed with caution among fans. Can you really go back and revisit the past without ultimately disappointing results? \n \nArriving now with relatively little hype or fanfare, T2: Trainspotting is here to answer that question. Picking up the story of the first film 20 years later, it finds Trainspotting's original band of anti-heroes scattered, and in most cases no closer to escaping the social underclass in which we found them two decades earlier. Spud (Ewen Bremner) is still hooked on heroin (a much smaller theme in T2), Begbie (Robert Carlyle) is in prison, Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) is ensconced in a world of prostitution and small-time extortion. Only Renton (Ewan MacGregor) appears to have escaped to some level of 'normal' life \u2013 and only because he stole from the others and fled the country at the end of the last film. \n \nAs T2 opens, Renton returns to his Edinburgh home after 20 years in Amsterdam (the joke being that there, he managed to stay drug-free). To some degree he is repentant; returning to right his past betrayal, but perhaps more than that he's simply coming home to explore that same nostalgic question: can you ever go back? \n \nJust like the original, this is a film about life on the very bottom rungs, and how desperate people will do anything when an opportunity presents itself - even if it means betraying their friends. The central cast all do a great job of reprising their characters; older, in some cases wiser, but each of them an utterly believable progression of their two-decades-earlier selves. And while the gruelling sense of prevailing darkness in Trainspotting's background is somewhat lightened in T2, there are still moments where we're plunged back into the abyss of social desperation. Both films are at their best when they force us to feel what it's like to be right at the end of your rope. \n \nTo be honest, it's a strange sort of a film, more of a whatever-happened-to update, an extended appendix to the first movie, than a totally new story. There are almost too many nostalgic nods to the original, to the point that we start to wonder if this story isn't strong enough to stand on its own two feet. \n  \n  \nAt moments though, it dazzles with its brilliance; Danny Boyle is one of the great directors working today, and at times the story rises to meet his ambitions. There's a set piece involving a retro nightclub; a truly heartbreaking moment as old friends Renton and Spud are reunited; a comic sequence including possibly the most culturally-offensive song ever committed to film (Boyle will burn up an awful lot of goodwill in this moment). The way he reprises the Choose Life speech from the original involves some quite majestic work from MacGregor and writer John Hodge \u2013 a moment where old meets new, and nostalgia is used to triumphant effect. \n \nThe language in the film is appallingly bad. I can't underline this enough; to those who abhor bad language even in context, T2 is off-the-scale awful. If you're sensitive to this, don't even attempt T2. But if you can get past that, I think the film has some interesting things to say, and helps us to consider subject matter with which large areas of the Church are now awkwardly unfamiliar. \n \nT2 challenges us to ask what hope our society really offers for people who find themselves at the very bottom of the ladder. Is crime and betrayal really the only way out of the plughole (or, in the film's recurrent theme, the toilet), or could friendship offer an alternative route? There really are men like the malevolent Begbie, who believes that life offers him nothing except the things he can take with his fists; or Spud, who finds himself caught in a closed loop of poverty, addiction and failed attempts at self-help. If the Church has nothing to say to these people, then what does it really have to say to anyone? The characters in T2 are precisely the sorts of people who Jesus would have hung out with. \n \nPerhaps more than anything though, the film is about nostalgia; how we fondly remember things less broken than they were, and how frustrated we feel when reality doesn't measure up. T2 is constantly self-referential, and nostalgic for the era in which the original emerged, yet self-aware enough to know that you can never quite go back and revisit history without feeling the eroding effects of time. Carlyle is quoted as saying - \"you are going to be thinking... what have I done with my life?\" \n \nThe original Trainspotting was a masterpiece, and as such impossible to repeat. In T2, Danny Boyle has created a piece of work which will satisfy fans, and entertain anyone with a passing knowledge of the first film. For the Church though, it repeats the same question of the first film: if things are really this desperate for millions of real people, what exactly are we doing to truly help them to Choose Life? \n \nMartin Saunders is a Contributing Editor for Christian Today and the Deputy CEO of Youthscape.

She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long. \n \nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports. \n \nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader. \n \nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion. \n \nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups. \n \nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism. \n \n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\" \n \nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said. \n \nThe story Families split as Trump Muslim ban 'banishes normal, honest people' first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Families split as Trump Muslim ban 'banishes normal, honest people'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2010","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Surry Hills","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Swan Hill Guardian","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"404719423","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Swan Hill Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203108541","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He was elected, and this is what democracy looks like. He does not, however, stand for the values that are important to me. Nor does he represent the vision that I hold for the future of the United States of America. So I marched in women's marches to show my disapproval for the anti-women rhetoric and actions belonging to the current president of the United States, and those belonging to many politicians in the Utah Legislature. \n \nI marched in Salt Lake City, and I marched in Park City. I march because I aim to be present, to be heard, and to represent those who are unable to march. I march because I am lucky to be an American woman living in the great state of Utah. The United States is a country where my civil liberties allow me the freedom to peacefully assemble, protest in public spaces and photograph anything in plain view. These are the rights that protected the thousands of Utahns who marched through the cascading snow to the Utah State Capitol and descended into the rotunda on the first day of the 2017 legislative session. \n  \nI march for women's rights that are inclusive of reproductive justice, clean air, health care, racial equality, LGBTQ rights, gun control, environmental protection, indigenous people's rights, immigrants' rights, education reform, religious freedom, economic justice and more. I march for women's rights as a holistic movement. I march to reaffirm the notions of equality, diversity, intersectionality and social justice. \n \nI march because politicians are attacking basic access to reproductive health care. Political leaders have pledged to introduce legislation attacking Planned Parenthood. Trump has already taken a severely anti-women action by reinstating the anti-health Mexico City Policy (the Global Gag Rule). \n \nPlanned Parenthood health centers are essential to the health and wellbeing of thousands of Utahns. In 2016, they provided more than 190,000 services to nearly 46,000 patients. They proudly provide abortion services. However, the vast majority of their work is providing preventative services, including family planning, cancer screenings and STI screenings. Last year, they provided more than 9,000 youth with the tools necessary to make informed decisions through sexual and reproductive health education. \n \nLegislation that \"defunds\" Planned Parenthood specifically targets patients who rely on federal safety net programs, such as Medicaid or Title X. For many, Planned Parenthood is the only health care provider they can turn to, as nationwide over half of Planned Parenthood health centers are in rural or otherwise medically underserved areas. The people who would be hurt most by \"defunding\" are those who already face barriers to accessing reproductive health care: people of color, people with low incomes, and people who live in rural areas. \n \nI march, and now, I stand. I stand with many allies prepared and eager to work to protect women's rights. I stand with those who disagree with my priorities, motivated and willing to find common ground. \n \nWe must all take a stand and unite around an inclusive women's rights and reproductive justice movement. We will not let legislators take our health care, our education, and our rights away. We will not go backwards. We have the power to protect women's rights. So let's stand up! And let's get to work! \n \nTaylor M. Snyder, MPH, is founder and director of Maternal and Infant Health Consulting, LLC, and a member of the board of Planned Parenthood Association of Utah.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Salt Lake City news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Comments: Op-ed: We march for justice and equality, and we will not go backwards","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Salt Lake","zipCode":"84101","state":"Utah","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Salt Lake City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Salt Lake Tribune","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169657500","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4687"},"name":"Salt Lake Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sltrib.com"},"linkedArticles":[{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29393651468"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29393651489"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29394053354"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29395460686"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29396102376"},{"type":"hasComment","articleId":"29396102377"}],"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203110059","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:57Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I felt this way even though I\u2019d come from a long line of them, had been baptized, and had even accompanied my mom to church most Sundays in suburban Denver, Colorado. But in general, I tried to keep Christians at arm\u2019s length. All that praising of God bothered me. All that praising had me convinced that these people were out of touch with reality, out of touch with the suffering and disappointment inherent to living. Like many 17-year-olds, I preferred having contraband Coors Light in my hand and a more jaded approach to life. \n\nA lot of those views toward Christians changed during my twenties. I was hit with a lot of personal adversity. I was in and out of the hospital with serious health problems and I began to struggle with a particularly stubborn streak of depression. I began my search for faith in earnest. As I searched, I found that a lot of these out-of-touch Christians stood by me, loved me unconditionally, and walked me steadily through my own personal darkness. Certainly I didn\u2019t see eye to eye with all Christians in the world on all subjects, but I had huge respect and admiration for the ones I knew. They were the real deal\u200a\u2014\u200akind, compassionate, and long-suffering; the kind of people who would drive over to my apartment in the middle of the night to sit up with me when I was too anxious to sleep. \n\nAll that praising had me convinced that these people were out of touch with reality, out of touch with the suffering and disappointment inherent to living. \n\n. . . Which is why I was so shocked when, some two months before the election, I settled into a chair across from one of these Christians I have respected so much, someone I consider a mentor. \n\nShe asked me how I was doing. I sighed. \n\n\u201cI feel pretty heavy. The political conversation has gotten so dark and vitriolic. It\u2019s getting to me.\u201d \n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she sighed back at me. \u201cThey\u2019re saying some really vicious things about Trump.\u201d \n\nMy world paused its axial rotation and came to a screeching halt. Her words hung in the middle of the room. My brain did somersaults. Was she . . . defending Donald Trump? \n\nShe noted my shocked silence. \n\n\u201cNot that I personally like him,\u201d she quickly added, \u201cbut people are really attacking him unfairly.\u201d \n\nThis was  not  the response I had expected. I was utterly perplexed. I offhandedly mentioned some things I thought were extremely worrying about Trump himself before changing the subject. I was not yet ready to reckon with the fact that someone who I regularly turned to for wisdom appeared to be defending Donald Trump\u200a\u2014\u200aappeared, perhaps, to even be voting for him. I was stunned. \n\nAnd in truth, I am still not ready to reckon with that fact. And I am still not ready to reckon with the exit polls that tell me a full  81% of self-identified white Evangelicals \u200a\u2014\u200aa group I am at the very least loosely associated with\u200a\u2014\u200avoted this man into the highest office in the nation. Seeing that figure glaring back at me felt like a punch to the gut. \n\nI don\u2019t always agree with the Evangelical community at large, and I am certainly dismayed by the ongoing politicization of Christianity. (For an enlightening take on that, see this Samantha Bee segment.) \n\n\n\nIt has long flummoxed me that this spiritual group has aligned itself so vehemently with a particular political platform. It feels shortsighted and myopic, omitting, as it does, important viewpoints from the other side of the aisle. It also feels like it\u2019s utterly missing the point. After all, the Jesus of scripture seemed seriously concerned with loving those he encountered (even and especially those unlike him) on a day-to-day basis. The Jesus of scripture seemed remarkably unconcerned with enacting specific governmental agendas. \n\nThe Jesus of scripture seemed remarkably unconcerned with enacting specific governmental agendas. \n\nIn spite of that difference of interpretation, though, I have always persisted in the belief that most Christians mean well. The Christians I know and interact with stand for love and truth and compassion and forgiveness and justice. \n\nThe Christians I know, although flawed, take words like these from 1 Corinthians 13 to heart: \n\u201cLove is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.\u201d \nSo when I saw Donald Trump coming, I felt assured that the majority of Christians would look beyond the Republican nomenclature and see a man who flagrantly and unapologetically stands for the opposite of the values Christians claim to espouse, a man who stands for bigotry, vindictiveness, mean-spiritedness, shameless hunger for power, and self-promotion at the expense of others. \n\nI was wrong. And being fundamentally wrong about this has sent me flailing into unfamiliar spiritual territory. Rationally, I understand what happened. I understand the existence of bubbles, echo chambers, fake news (which is what I think my mentor fell prey to in particular), fear, tribalism, and the  demise of Christian intellectualism . \n\nBut emotionally, I don\u2019t understand. Emotionally, I am spiraling. I feel betrayed by and alienated from the larger Christian community. I haven\u2019t been to church since October. I find myself praying less. I question everything:  How can I trust Christians again? Should I? Are they ignorant? Hopelessly blinded by partisan politics? Self-absorbed? Ruthlessly unconcerned with the well-being of those unlike them? Are they outright ill-intentioned and racist? \n\nMy faith\u200a\u2014\u200athe lens through which I see the world\u200a\u2014\u200ahas felt fractured since November. I feel myself growing cynical, jaded. I feel myself reverting back to that 17-year-old girl guzzling Coors Light on the sly, convinced Christians are out of touch with reality. Because right now, I am convinced that a lot of Christians are out of touch with reality. \n\nRationally, I understand what happened. Emotionally, I am spiraling. \n\nSome things encourage me. I\u2019m encouraged that many  non -Evangelical Christians saw Trump for the threat he is and refused to vote for him. I\u2019m encouraged by the idea\u200a\u2014\u200aset forth by religious history expert and  Washington Post  contributor  Thomas S. Kidd \u200a\u2014\u200athat perhaps the term \u201cEvangelical\u201d has become an irrelevant term for devout Christians, associated as it now is with a particular subset of Christians who hold certain specific cultural beliefs. \n\nI\u2019m also encouraged that the God I find myself continuing to believe in is loving, compassionate, and truthful\u200a\u2014\u200aregardless of the grave shortcomings of his followers. And of course I\u2019m encouraged that there are many who, irrespective of religious affiliation, are committed to taking the threats of this administration seriously. \n\nI\u2019m working on forgiving the Christians I feel betrayed by. Forgiving, of course, does not mean condoning. Forgiving means I choose to release bitterness. \n\nAnd I want to apologize, on behalf of Christians, for any complicity, tacit or explicit, that my religious group has played in ushering in an era in which vulnerable groups become more vulnerable, democracy becomes shaky, and the future becomes less bright. I\u2019m truly sorry from the bottom of my heart. \n\nAnd because many Christians have left a vacuum in place of hope and common decency, I promise to speak up ever louder to fill those gaps. I will work to protect the vulnerable, to hold up human dignity, and to safeguard freedom, in any way I can. \n\nRead more at The Establishment, and follow us on Facebook and Twitter . \n      Related Stories No President Cares More About Size\u2014So Let's Show Trump How Many of Us Oppose Him Bill Moyers: Donald Trump Is Turning American Democracy into Demolition Derby America's Founding Fathers Warned Us About Men Like Donald Trump","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Anna Anderson is a writer"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Christian Community's Support of Donald Trump Broke My Heart","source":{"category":"Organisation","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"AlterNet.org","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170152444","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1351"},"name":"AlterNet.org","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.alternet.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/how-the-faithful-voted-a-preliminary-2016-analysis/","http://harpers.org/archive/2016/09/the-watchmen/","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/07/22/polls-show-evangelicals-support-trump-but-the-term-evangelical-has-become-meaningless/?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.b79bf95f067e%29%20voted%20for%20Trump.%20%20%20http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/","https://www.facebook.com/ESTBLSHMNT/?fref=ts","https://twitter.com/estblshmnt?lang=en","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~license.icopyright.net/3.18566?icx_id=1071258","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/how-the-faithful-voted-a-preliminary-2016-analysis/","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~harpers.org/archive/2016/09/the-watchmen/","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/07/22/polls-show-evangelicals-support-trump-but-the-term-evangelical-has-become-meaningless/?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.b79bf95f067e%29%20voted%20for%20Trump.%","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.facebook.com/ESTBLSHMNT/?fref=ts","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://twitter.com/estblshmnt?lang=en"],"sequenceId":"695203113565","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T17:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.alternet.org/files/styles/story_image/public/story_images/shutterstock_531764551.jpg"},{"url":"http://http://license.icopyright.net/images/icopy-w.png"},{"url":"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/264379222/0/alternet"},{"url":"http://license.icopyright.net/images/icopy-w.png"}],"video":[]}}

She has been with DATAMARK for 17 years, starting her career with the company in 2000 as a software developer. \n \n\u201cNina\u2019s long track record of success in delivering business process improvement solutions to our clients will be an asset in her new role as VP of Sales and Marketing,\u201d said DATAMARK President Bill Randag. \u201cNina\u2019s experience as a technical sales specialist and her deep understanding of the roles that people, process and technology play in business process management make her the ideal candidate for this position.\u201d \n \nBrown assumes the role of VP of Sales and Marketing during an exciting time of growth and expansion for DATAMARK. As a result of this recent growth, DATAMARK recently announced the opening of a second service delivery center in India, located in the country\u2019s financial and commercial center of Mumbai. DATAMARK\u2019s service footprint currently extends across multiple locations in the U.S., Mexico and India. \n \nAfter joining DATAMARK in 2000, Brown played an active role in leading software development projects for clients in the financial services, insurance and healthcare payer sectors, helping achieve new levels of process efficiency and cost savings. Brown later took on significant roles as a project manager, leading large-scale BPO transitions, including the launch of new consolidated mailroom services for a prominent leader in the banking industry in 2006. She then continued to partner with Sales and Marketing to expand partnerships, services, and locations and was instrumental in driving initiatives which led to over $15 million in new revenue for DATAMARK, including the expansion of a partnership in 2010 with a Fortune 100 financial services client, yielding the opening of a new domestic operational facility. \n \nIn 2012, Brown established DATAMARK\u2019s Business Engineering Department, to serve as a team of technical sales specialists for the company, and also introduced Consulting as a new service in the company portfolio. In this capacity, she and her Engineering department were involved in engagements which led to multiple new client partnerships as well as significant incremental revenue increases over the years. Thus, soon after, she was promoted to DATAMARK\u2019s Senior Management Team as Director of Engineering, responsible for oversight of the Business Engineering and Software Development and Validation departments. In this role, she continued to exceed client expectations, establishing DATAMARK as an industry leader in core business technology to enhance operational services, including the DATAMARK proprietary Document Tracking System and INDIGO Processing System. With her extensive experience with technology and process improvement, Nina has been uniquely poised to identify opportunities for business optimization and business growth, thus continuously working to strengthen and expand the DATAMARK client base. \n \nThroughout her career at DATAMARK, she has worked closely with the Sales and Marketing teams, applying her process redesign expertise to RFP responses and business process improvement solutions for clients. Brown has also represented DATAMARK as a subject matter expert in numerous webinar presentations, marketing videos, and at industry events and tradeshows. In her new role, Brown will integrate Business Engineering with Sales and Marketing, creating a cohesive structure for business development aligned with technical sales. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to be leading our Sales and Marketing teams as DATAMARK moves to add new clients to our BPO and contact center services portfolio,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe will continue to build on our reputation as a business service provider that brings together best-fit technology solutions and a talented international workforce that acts with integrity to exceed the expectations of our partners for customer service, quality, timeliness and security.\u201d \n \nBrown is certified in Action Selling, is an ASQ-certified Six Sigma Black Belt (CSSBB) and a certified Project Management Professional (PMP). \n \nAbout DATAMARK \n \nDATAMARK, Inc. is a leading business process outsourcing company specializing in high-volume digital mailroom management, document processing/document management, contact center services, and process improvement consulting for Fortune 500 companies and other large enterprises. \n \nHeadquartered in El Paso, Texas, DATAMARK employs nearly 2,000 people in its U.S., Mexico and India facilities.

Greg Abbott has taken extreme steps to shut down choice by women. After Abbott made an order that all women who have abortions and miscarriages must pay to have the remains buried, women launched a protest. \n\nThe Dallas Morning News   reports  that one woman, Ele Chupik, took to Facebook to urge women to send their used feminine hygiene products to Abbott. Chupik had no idea that women would actually do it, but they did. \n\n\u201cUnsure about fertilized status of these panty liners,\u201d one anonymous sender wrote including her package. \n\nThrough December at least 17 women mailed their bloodstained products to the Texas governor\u2019s office according to records the paper obtained. \n\n\u201cSending unprotected human bodily waste is a health hazard,\u201d said Michael Sullivan, a postal inspector in the capitol city. \u201cWe don\u2019t see a whole lot of that.\u201d \n\nThe governor\u2019s office kept the incident quiet, not reporting it to the press or to the postal inspector. The staff simply threw them away, but made digital copies of the items, perhaps for an open records request. Most elected officials\u2019 offices keep mail on file. \n\n\u201cI am enclosing my tampons and sanitary pads as long as the law stands,\u201d another woman wrote in. \n\nOne woman that didn\u2019t even live in the state mailed her items encouraging the office: \u201cBury this!\u201d \n\n\u201cI hoped that it would be taken as an insult,\u201d Chupik said. \u201cThe same way we feel insulted.\u201d \n\nSullivan explained that most people who send items don\u2019t include a return address, so it\u2019s difficult to prosecute postal violations. \n\nA federal judge has put the kibosh  on enforcing the law, but it will likely be a while before the order is declared unconstitutional. That means several more cycles of menstrual products women can send. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re seeing it for the shaming tactic that it is, and that\u2019s deeply offensive to people,\u201d said NARAL Pro-Choice Texas director Heather Busby. \n\nChupik never did mail in her own products though she did think about dipping some tampons in red paint and sending them to the governor. \n\n\u201cSending in the tampons felt like it was more for us,\u201d she said, \u201cjust a catharsis.\u201d \n\n\n      Related Stories No President Cares More About Size\u2014So Let's Show Trump How Many of Us Oppose Him Bill Moyers: Donald Trump Is Turning American Democracy into Demolition Derby The Christian Community's Support of Donald Trump Broke My Heart","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sarah K.

The policy, which bans funding any international organization that dares to even talk about abortion, has  contributed to thousands of women\u2019s deaths across the globe . \n\nThe executive order was just the beginning. In the short time Trump has been president, his administration has set a disastrous course for women\u2019s health and rights. On Tuesday, days after historic marches that put millions of women on the street globally, Republican congressmen  introduced the first ever federal \u2018heartbeat bill\u2019  - a policy that would ban abortions after six weeks, well before most women even know they\u2019re pregnant. \n\nThat same day, the House passed a bill that would make the dangerous and discriminatory Hyde Amendment \u2013 which prevents federal funds from covering abortion, even in cases of fetal abnormalities and maternal health issues \u2013 permanent.  The bill , which targets poor women, would also impact abortion coverage for women with private insurance. Congressional republicans have even  introduced a federal \u2018personhood\u2019 bill  that would define life as beginning at conception. \n\nWhile the bills will not likely get far, the new administration is sending a clear message \u2013 they\u2019re keeping Trump\u2019s promise  to punish women who have abortions , and rolling back hard-won rights. These are far-reaching and radical policies that quite literally kill women. There is no overstating just how harmful they are. \n\nSo you\u2019ll excuse me for laughing off recent suggestions that feminists embrace \u201cpro-life\u201d women in the name of inclusivity. You don\u2019t get to feel bad about being banned from the treehouse when you\u2019re in the middle of setting the trunk on fire. \nAnd let\u2019s be clear: these political positions are not about reducing the number of abortions. The global gag rule, for example, has been shown  to increase abortion  \u2013 especially illegal and unsafe abortions. The same is true for state level abortion bans; hundreds of thousands of women in Texas have  tried to induce their own abortions . Anti-choice policies don\u2019t prevent women ending their pregnancies, they just ensure that women do it dangerously. \nIf anti-abortion legislators or so-called pro-life feminists were interested in decreasing the number of abortions they\u2019d be enthusiastically supporting comprehensive sex education, affordable birth control, and access to over-the-counter emergency contraception. They\u2019d be introducing legislation to mandate paid parental leave and subsidized child care. \n\nBut they\u2019re not. And they won\u2019t. So let\u2019s not fool ourselves \u2013 these next four years are about fighting for what\u2019s right, not searching for the nonexistent distraction of common ground. \n\nConservative, and mostly male, legislators will continue to push extreme policies; not necessarily with the hope that they\u2019ll pass, but with the understanding that less radical laws might then seem \u201creasonable.\u201d Diane Horvath-Cosper from Physicians for Reproductive Health  told the Guardian  this week, \u201cSo when a congressman introduces a 20-week bill, it looks moderate by comparison.\u201d \n\nBut there is nothing moderate or reasonable about forced pregnancy, not at any point.

He saw the problems that existed within our nation and worked tirelessly to make our country better for everyone. \n \nLincoln, like most human beings, didn\u2019t always get it right. Yes, he contradicted himself on a number of occasions, but he led with honor. Lincoln knew that even the divided version of America he had to preside over deserved his best. Today our country seems nearly as divided as it was in those Civil War days. Unfortunately, we have a leader who has disgustingly low expectations. Anyone with access to wifi and the ability to spell \u201cGoogle\u201d can prove that Donald J. Trump lies almost every time he opens his mouth. I could take it if I thought he was delusional­. But he\u2019s not. He\u2019s just low. \n  \nTrump is making our country look bad, as low as his lewd comments about immigrants and women. As low as our country was during the disgusting days of chattel slavery and Jim Crow. And it\u2019s not just his lies, his constant blabbermouthing or his horrible moves, like shutting down EPA grants, muzzling federal employees or closing our doors to war refugees. No, it\u2019s the way he celebrates the ignorance that fuels these half-baked decisions. \n \nWhat do we tell our kids? How do we prepare them for a world where people are proud to be stupid misers who adhere to no moral code? Really, what do our children have to look forward to? Imagine someone\u2019s young daughter, flopped next to grandma on the couch watching Kellyanne Conway talk about  \u201calternative facts,\u201d  with that twitchy, nervous smile on her face. What are we supposed to tell that young girl, if someone who works for the president of the United States displays no shame and no decency? \n \nWhen the people on Trump\u2019s team aren\u2019t lying, they are simply saying something stupid. A few days ago White House press secretary  Sean Spicer said  that his boss \u201csat down with Martin Luther King Jr.,\u201d which ranks high among the most disrespectful statements made by this uninspiring administration. \n \nSpicer mixed up Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the history-shaping icon of the Civil Rights movement, with his son, Martin Luther King III. The younger King has no impactful connection to any modern movement related to the advancement of black people­ \u2014 he\u2019s mostly known for trying to sell his dad\u2019s traveling Bible and Nobel Peace Prize. Of course Spicer, with the same hubris as his boss, didn\u2019t bother to apologize. Maybe he thinks all black people are interchangeable, or maybe he just thinks they aren\u2019t important, just like other annoying things such as honesty and truth. \n \nWe used to take pride in innovation. America was a nation of accomplishment after accomplishment­­ \u2014 we excelled in art, science, business, thought and technology. And now we just get disrespectful tweets and half-baked excuses from underachievers. Is this the new normal? \n \nCan we really take four years of this national downgrade and debasement? Because the notion that America might be the world\u2019s No. 1 superpower just seems laughable now. It\u2019s not even debatable, and as long as Trump is president our nation\u2019s status declines a little more every day. Make America great again? Give me a break. Right now, we really suck. \n  \nD. Watkins is the author of The Beast Side: Living and Dying While Black in America .

The women's march can only be the start.      \nI\u2019ll say this about the Trump presidency: it certainly has a clarifying effect. It has, for a start, clarified who the most shamelessly awful people in British public life are, as Trump\u2019s defenders rise like floaters, desperately chasing a cosy ambassadorship or at least a follow on Twitter. Nigel Farage, Arron Banks, Michael Gove, media figures who once had a certain clout but now gain validation only from social media and so should never be mentioned by anyone again; all eagerly posing for photos with their alpha papa and dutifully describing his every face-forward stumble as a graceful pirouette, a litter of Squealers  to Trump\u2019s Napoleon (the Animal Farm references come so readily these days). \n\nThe president\u2019s supporters insist the haters just don\u2019t understand him, not the way they, his BFFs, do. OK, sure, he repeatedly bellowed \u201cAmerica first\u201d in his inauguration speech, but, as Michael Gove explained to Robert Peston last Sunday, the rest of us are looking at Trump \u201cwith, I believe, an insufficient degree of context\u201d. (The context in this particular instance  being that the America First Committee was an isolationist pressure group fronted by the notorious antisemite, Charles Lindbergh; the Anti-Defamation League has repeatedly asked Trump to stop using this toxic and loaded phrase to no avail. How\u2019s that for background, Michael?) After all, these men say, he\u2019s always been \u2013 and I quote one of them \u2013 \"a good loyal friend .\" It\u2019s been a while since I read Dante, but I\u2019m pretty sure the centre of hell was described as a place where wealthy, straight, white men fart on about how Trump was nice to them, so why would anyone moan? \n\nBut every action must have an equal and opposite reaction, and so while some people are sinking to the absolute bottom, I see many more rising to the creamy top. The Trump presidency has motivated millions to take action, even people like me who can barely be bothered to leave the house most days. My WhatsApp groups, most of which were set up to share comedy headlines from Goop, have become improbable places of insurgency. One group of university friends joined the campaign Bridges Not Walls  and held a banner  reading \u201cMigration is older than language\u201d across Westminster Bridge in London, while a friend in New York draped a similar one from the Queensboro Bridge  both made the international news. Another group is holding fundraisers for women\u2019s and refugee shelters. Because there comes a point when you have to choose between endorsing a crooked and bigoted regime or fighting back; there is no in between, and that point is now. \n\nLast weekend, while Trump was lying to the CIA, I marched in London, just as my mother did in Paris, and my American friends did in New York, Washington DC and Los Angeles. Millions of women around the world were united by a determination to show that they would not silently accept a man who threatens their rights, who mocks menstruation and grabs vaginas. \n\nHilariously, some people, even those on the left, mocked the protest, or at least questioned whether it was \u201cdemocratic\u201d \u2013 as though the freedom to protest wasn\u2019t the absolute essence of democracy. \u201cIt\u2019s precisely this sort of stuff [a women\u2019s march] that lead to Donald Trump,\u201d one leftish journalist tweeted  It always  is  a woman\u2019s fault, isn\u2019t it? Come on, ladies, stop alienating men by protesting against misogyny! \n\nA common criticism was that the march lacked specificity. We need to target issues, not waste time shouting about watery generalisations, these critics say. Well, women are multitaskers and I\u2019ll show you an entire gender that can do both. After all, no president has ever cared more than Trump about size and numbers. So fight specific issues, by all means \u2013 but let\u2019s also show him how many of us are in it together. \n\nSimilarly, Labour MP Richard Burgon tweeted , \u201cTrump\u2019s inauguration is what happens when centre/left parties abandon transformation of economic system and rely on identity politics\u201d. During the campaign, Hillary Clinton was criticised for being a dry policy wonk; now, apparently, she was a trendy proselytiser of identity politics. But analysis of her speeches  shows that she talked largely about jobs and workers, and only occasionally women\u2019s rights. So when men say Clinton talked too much about \u201cidentity politics\u201d, and that women shouldn\u2019t protest, what I hear is, \u201cWomen should just shut up.\u201d Bad luck. \n\nTrump\u2019s lies and attacks on the press show why these protests and fightbacks are necessary. As comedian Aziz Ansari said on Saturday Night Live last week, \u201cChange doesn\u2019t come from presidents. Change comes from large groups of angry people.\u201d We\u2019re here, we\u2019re angry and we\u2019re ready. \n       Related Stories Bill Moyers: Donald Trump Is Turning American Democracy into Demolition Derby The Christian Community's Support of Donald Trump Broke My Heart Refugee Ban Echoes One of the Darkest Chapters in American History","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Hadley Freeman is a Guardian columnist and features writer"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"No President Cares More About Size\u2014So Let's Show Trump How Many of Us Oppose Him","source":{"category":"Organisation","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"AlterNet.org","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170152444","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1351"},"name":"AlterNet.org","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.alternet.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/animalfarm/characters.html","http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-america-first-anti-semitic-isolationist-history-20170121-story.html","http://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/799931692001562624","http://bridgesnotwalls.uk/","http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/antitrump-banners-unveiled-across-london-hours-before-his-inauguration-a3445236.html","http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/anti-trump-bridges-not-walls-sign-appears-queensboro-bridge-article-1.2951251","http://twitter.com/DPJHodges/status/822102387389251584","http://twitter.com/RichardBurgon/status/822417591713075201","http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/12/16/13972394/most-common-words-hillary-clinton-speech","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whde50AacZs","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~license.icopyright.net/3.18566?icx_id=1071319","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.sparknotes.com/lit/animalfarm/characters.html","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-america-first-anti-semitic-isolationist-history-20170121-story.html","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/799931692001562624","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~bridgesnotwalls.uk/","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.standard.co.uk/news/london/antitrump-banners-unveiled-across-london-hours-before-his-inauguration-a3445236.html","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/anti-trump-bridges-not-walls-sign-appears-queensboro-bridge-article-1.2951251","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~twitter.com/DPJHodges/status/822102387389251584","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~twitter.com/RichardBurgon/status/822417591713075201","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/12/16/13972394/most-common-words-hillary-clinton-speech","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whde50AacZs"],"sequenceId":"695203120257","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T22:26:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.alternet.org/files/styles/story_image/public/story_images/shutterstock_564313945.jpg"},{"url":"http://http://license.icopyright.net/images/icopy-w.png"},{"url":"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/264380440/0/alternet"},{"url":"http://license.icopyright.net/images/icopy-w.png"}],"video":[]}}

Smash it. Fair pay for working people? Crush it. And on and on.      \nWe\u2019re a week into the Trump administration and it\u2019s pretty obvious what he\u2019s up to. First, Donald Trump is running a demolition derby: He wants to demolish everything he doesn\u2019t like, and he doesn\u2019t like a lot, especially when it comes to government. \n\nLike one of those demolition drivers on a speedway, he keeps ramming his vehicle against all the others, especially government policies and programs and agencies that protect people who don\u2019t have his wealth, power or privilege. Affordable health care for working people? Smash it. Consumer protection against predatory banks and lenders? Run over it. Rules and regulations that rein in rapacious actors in the market? Knock \u2018em down. Fair pay for working people? Crush it. And on and on. \n\nTrump came to Washington to tear the government down for parts, and as far as we can tell, he doesn\u2019t seem to have anything at all in mind to replace it except turning back the clock to when business took what it wanted and left behind desperate workers, dirty water and polluted air. \n\nIn this demolition derby, Trump seems to have the wholehearted support of the Republican Party, which loathes government as much as it worships the market as god. Remember  Thomas Frank\u2019s book,  The Wrecking Crew ? Published in 2008, it remains one of the best political books of the past quarter-century. Frank took the measure of an unholy alliance: the century-old business crusade against government, the conservative ideology that looks on government as evil (except when it\u2019s enriching its allies), and the Republican Party of George W. Bush and Karl Rove \u2014 the one that had just produced eight years of crony capitalism and private plunder. \n\nThe Wrecking Crew  \u2014 and what an apt title it was \u2014 showed how federal agencies were doomed to failure by the incompetence and hostility of the Bush gang appointed to run them, the same model Trump is using now. Frank tracked how wholesale deregulation \u2014 on a scale Trump already is trying to reproduce \u2014 led to devastating results for everyday people, including the mortgage meltdown and the financial crash. Reading the book is like reading today\u2019s news, as kleptomaniacs spread across Washington to funnel billions of dollars into the pockets of lobbyists and corporations. \n\nThat may include the pockets of Donald Trump\u2019s own family.  As Jonathan Chait wrote after the election  in  New York  magazine, \u201c[Trump\u2019s] children have taken roles on the transition team. Ivanka attended official discussions with heads of state of  Japan  and  Argentina . [As president-elect, Trump himself]  met with Indian business partners  to discuss business and  lobbied a British politician  to oppose offshore wind farms because one will block the view at one of his Scottish golf courses.\u201d Only a couple of days ago it was reported that the Trump organization would  more than triple  the number of Trump hotels in America. And why not? Its chief marketer works out of the Oval Office. \n\nJonathan Chait went on to say: \u201cTrump\u2019s brazen use of his office for personal enrichment signals something even more worrisome than  four or more years of kleptocratic government . It reveals how willing the new administration is to obliterate governing norms and how little stands in his way.\u201d \n\nAnd oh yes, something else: David Sirota at  International Business Times   has just published a new report  showing that the Trump administration appears to be quietly killing the federal government\u2019s major ethics rule designed to prevent White House officials from enriching their former clients. Experts say a review of government documents shows that regulators appear to have abruptly stopped enforcing the rule, even though it remains the law of the land. \n\nWe were warned.  Donald Trump himself told  The New York Times , \u201cThe law is totally on my side, meaning, the president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest.\u201d  Shades of Richard Nixon, who said , \u201cWhen the President does it, that means that it is not illegal.\u201d And who also announced, \u201c I am not a crook .\u201d \n\nI know plutocracy is not a commonly used word in America. But it\u2019s a word that increasingly fits what\u2019s happening here. Plutocracy means government by the wealthy, a ruling class of the rich and their retainers. If you don\u2019t see plutocracy spreading across America, you haven\u2019t been paying attention. Both parties have nurtured, tolerated and bowed to it. Now we\u2019re reaching the pinnacle, as Trump\u2019s own Cabinet is rich (no pun intended) in millionaires and billionaires. He is stacking the agencies and boards of government with the wealthy and friends of wealth so that the whole of the federal enterprise can be directed to rewarding those with deep pockets, the ones who provide the bags and bags of money that are dumped into our political process today.Which leads us to the second design now apparent in Trump\u2019s strategy of deliberate chaos. He may have run a populist campaign, but now it appears he aims to substitute plutocracy for democracy. \n\nYes, both Democrats and Republicans have been guilty of groveling to the wealthy who fund them; it\u2019s a staggering bipartisan scandal that threatens the country and was no small part of Trump\u2019s success last November, even as ordinary people opened their windows and shouted, \u201cWe\u2019re as mad as hell and we\u2019re not going to take it anymore.\u201d So now we have in power a man who represents the very worst of the plutocrats \u2014 one who knows the price of everything but the value of nothing. I shudder to think where this nightmare will end. Even if you voted for Donald Trump for a reason that truly is from your heart, I cannot believe you voted for this. \n\nTell me if I\u2019m wrong. Tell me whose side are you really on? The people of America or the cynics and predators at the very top who would climb atop the ruins of the republic for a better view of the sunset? \n      Related Stories No President Cares More About Size\u2014So Let's Show Trump How Many of Us Oppose Him The Christian Community's Support of Donald Trump Broke My Heart Refugee Ban Echoes One of the Darkest Chapters in American History","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Bill Moyers, BillMoyers.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Bill Moyers: Donald Trump Is Turning American Democracy into Demolition Derby","source":{"category":"Organisation","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"AlterNet.org","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170152444","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1351"},"name":"AlterNet.org","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.alternet.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://us.macmillan.com/thewreckingcrew/thomasfrank/9780805090901/","http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/trumps-kleptocracy-already-feels-like-old-news.html","http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/ivanka-preps-to-run-trumps-business-by-meeting-japans-pm.html","http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/ivanka-joined-trumps-phone-call-with-argentinas-president.html","http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/trump-met-with-his-indian-business-partners-last-week.html","http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/trump-on-business-conflicts-voters-knew-who-i-was.html","https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-25/trump-hotels-to-triple-locations-in-u-s-expansion-ceo-says","http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/theres-only-one-legal-barrier-to-trumps-kleptocracy.html","http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/trump-white-house-appears-kill-obamas-ethics-rule-appointees-may-not-be-signing","https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/us/politics/your-guide-to-most-important-quotes-times-trump-interview.html","https://thinkprogress.org/when-the-president-does-it-that-means-that-it-is-not-illegal-f04424f60c93#.asn7zy6j8","https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/nov-17-1973-nixon-declares-i-am-not-a-crook/","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~license.icopyright.net/3.18566?icx_id=1071309","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~us.macmillan.com/thewreckingcrew/thomasfrank/9780805090901/","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/trumps-kleptocracy-already-feels-like-old-news.html","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/ivanka-preps-to-run-trumps-business-by-meeting-japans-pm.html","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/ivanka-joined-trumps-phone-call-with-argentinas-president.html","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/trump-met-with-his-indian-business-partners-last-week.html","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/trump-on-business-conflicts-voters-knew-who-i-was.html","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-25/trump-hotels-to-triple-locations-in-u-s-expansion-ceo-says","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/theres-only-one-legal-barrier-to-trumps-kleptocracy.html","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/trump-white-house-appears-kill-obamas-ethics-rule-appointees-may-not-be-signing","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/us/politics/your-guide-to-most-important-quotes-times-trump-interview.html","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://thinkprogress.org/when-the-president-does-it-that-means-that-it-is-not-illegal-f04424f60c93#.asn7zy6j8","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/nov-17-1973-nixon-declares-i-am-not-a-crook/"],"sequenceId":"695203120446","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T17:10:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.alternet.org/files/styles/story_image/public/story_images/photo_-__2013-04-12_at_3.03.51_pm.jpg"},{"url":"http://http://license.icopyright.net/images/icopy-w.png"},{"url":"http://license.icopyright.net/images/icopy-w.png"},{"url":"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/264379224/0/alternet"}],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

Today's would be wise to follow its example. \n    \nPhoto Credit: Capture Light / Shutterstock \n   \nAs an aged Benjamin Franklin rose at the Philadelphia convention in 1787 to cast his vote for the Constitution, he also cast a warning that conservative devotees of the document\u2019s \u201coriginal intent,\" readers of conservative websites, members of the Federalist Society and of such business-corporation funded entities as The American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the Conservative Political Action Committee, and American Legislative Exchange Council, the William F. Buckley Program at Yale, the Tea Party, and dozens more such conservative think-tank and \u201cpopular front\u201d organizations should heed now more urgently than ever before: \n \n\"I agree to this Constitution with all its faults Franklin said, adding that it \u201ccan only end in despotism, as other forms have done before it, when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic government, being incapable of any other.\u2026 Much of the strength and efficiency of any government, in procuring and securing happiness to the people, depends\u2026 on the general opinion of the goodness of that government, as well as of the wisdom and integrity of its governors.\u201d \n \nThe rest of  Franklin\u2019s remarks  make clear just how worried he was. And he was far from alone. As I  showed  recently,  the founders were reading Edward Gibbon\u2019s account of how the ancient Roman republic had slipped into tyranny, degree by self-deluding degree, as its powerful men titillated and intimidated its citizens into becoming bread-and-circus mobs. \n  \n\"History does not more clearly point out any fact than this, that nations which have lapsed from liberty, to a state of slavish subjection, have been brought to this unhappy condition, by gradual paces,\" wrote founder Richard Henry Lee. It could happen not with a bloody coup but with a smile and a friendly swagger, if the people had grown tired of self-government and could be jollied along or scared into servitude. \n \nEven Alexander Hamilton, whose bold innovations we\u2019re hearing so much about, saw the enormity of the gamble the founders were taking. Campaigning for the new Constitution, he wrote that history seemed to have destined Americans, \"by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force.\" He was skeptical enough about that to have considered calling for an American monarchy. \n \nToday\u2019s conservatives may be equally worried about freedom\u2019s prospects, but they tend to blame the overbearing state and its pensioners and pandering politicians, not the rapacity of the rich and their other investors and managers.  John Adams was wise enough  to blame both predators and prey:   \n  \n\u201cObsta principiis, nip the shoots of arbitrary power in the bud, is the only maxim which can ever preserve the liberties of any people. When the people give way, their deceivers, betrayers, and destroyers press upon them so fast, that there is no resisting afterwards. The nature of the encroachment upon the American constitution is such, as to grow every day more and more encroaching. Like a cancer, it eats faster and faster every hour. The revenue creates pensioners, and the pensioners urge for more revenue. The people grow less steady, spirited, and virtuous, the seekers more numerous and more corrupt, and every day increases the circles of their dependents and expectants, until virtue, integrity, public spirit, simplicity, and frugality, become the objects of ridicule and scorn, and vanity, luxury, foppery, selfishness, meanness, and downright venality swallow up the whole society.\u201d \n  \nSo here we are. It has come to this. And please think carefully about who Adams had in mind when he wrote \u201cseekers.\u201d He didn\u2019t mean the pensioners, whom he\u2019d already mentioned.   \n \nTrue enough, were he alive today, Adams might denigrate Franklin D. Roosevelt and Bernie Sanders as the people\u2019s \u201cdeceivers, betrayers, and destroyers.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t only big, corrupt government that was challenged by the original Boston Tea Party (led partly by John Adams\u2019 cousin, Samuel Adams). To John\u2019s oft-expressed delight, the Tea Party acted directly against the multi-national corporation, The East India Company, that the rebels insisted had  corrupted  government. They seized that corporation\u2019s property, something they\u2019ve yet to do with Pfizer\u2019s drugs, for example. When they break into that company\u2019s headquarters on 42nd Street in Manhattan and its warehouses around the country, I\u2019ll cheer, too. \n \nThe founders honored the Tea Party and denigrated corporations whose practices had driven small business-people and consumers to desperation worse than that of today\u2019s Tea Partiers, who don\u2019t want anyone tampering with their government-provided Social Security and Medicaid.    \n \nYet Donald Trump, who holds today\u2019s Tea Partiers and many other conservatives in his thrall, has criticized the overbearing state but not the omnivorous markets that corrupt it. In in his inaugural address,  he proclaimed  that, \u201cFor too long, a small group in our nation\u2019s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left, and the factories closed.\u201d   \n \nHe didn't say that those politicians prospered because they were paid off to pass laws that permit others to prosper in ways whose costs the people are bearing, trapped like flies in a spider\u2019s web of 800-numbered, sticky-fingered, pick-pocketing and surveillance machines.  \n \nA few years ago, a propane deliveryman installing a new tank to replace an old rusted one told me that the new one was \u201creally junk\u201d because the government had written substandard regulations on its size and composition. \u201cWho do you think really wrote those regulations?\u201d I asked. \u201cYour own employer wrote them, through a national association of propane dealers.\u201d A fleeting look of surprise and then understanding crossed his face. He\u2019d probably been watching too much Fox News and needed to be reminded of realities like the conservative, corporate American Legislative Exchange Council, which writes such bills for dozens of state legislatures controlled by Republicans.  \n \nBut what have neoliberal Democrats done to prevent such corruption? Not enough to have given Hillary Clinton credibility with the people who are bearing the costs. If breaking a corrupt structure\u2019s glass ceilings doesn\u2019t also involve breaking up its walls and foundations, it will produce too many glass-ceiling breakers such as Theresa May (Trump\u2019s new friend), Elaine Chao (Mitch McConnell\u2019s wife and Trump\u2019s transportation secretary), not to mention the late Margaret Thatcher, Carly Fiorina, Linda McMahon, Sarah Palin, Sheryl Sandberg, and on and on.  \n \nSo much for the raiment of \u201cdiversity\u201d that liberal Democrats have been guilty of draping over structures of inequality that they\u2019ve done little to challenge. But Trump\u2019s promises to restore jobs that, even if they do come, won\u2019t come with the kinds of overtime pay, health benefits, workplace safety protections, and unions that ensure them, are equally hollow. Instead he\u2019ll give his supporters more of the scapegoating and Trumpian \u201cbread and circus\u201d hate-fests and spectacles that drew so many to him in the first place. That kind of politics has a history no honorable conservative wants to repeat.  \n \nYou might answer that Americans have been here before and that the republic has recovered, as it did when the Civil War sparked what Lincoln called \u201ca new birth of freedom\u201d or when the roaring nationalist capitalism that drove World War I and the rampant consumerism of the Roaring \u201820s met its inevitable implosion in 1929 and sparked the suffrage movement, the New Deal and, in time, the civil rights movement at its best. Today\u2019s Tea Party conservatives are so named because they\u2019ve vowed to revive and defend the original, small-\u201cr\u201d republican faith of the Revolution and Constitution against what they think have been the hollowness of the post-Civil War Reconstruction and the New Deal, which they blame for inducing the dependency and weakness that Adams lamented.   \n \nBut if they really want to recover the spirit of liberty that Adams cheered, why aren\u2019t they taking on Pfizer and the Goldman-Sachs billionaires in Trump\u2019s cabinet? Why is their William F. Buckley Program at Yale putting 19- and 20-year-old students into to tuxedos and ferrying them to receptions and dinners at posh hotels such as the Pierre in New York, where,  over filet mignon  and seven-layered chocolate cake, they dine out on the follies of elites (though never aspiring conservative elites like themselves) whom the program\u2019s director Lauren Noble  holds responsible  for the \u201cdisconnect between elite institutions like Yale and the American people. As long as our elite institutions remain so close-minded and uncharitable to the anxieties and aspirations of so many of their fellow citizens, the outlook of our civil discourse is grim.\u201d   \n \nIsn\u2019t there a less-than-faint irony in staging these lavish affairs to call out anyone for disconnecting from their fellow citizens? Why aren\u2019t more conservatives disowning the grim reaper of civil discourse, Trump, and shedding their black ties for the dress and posture of Nathan Hale, a 1773 Yale graduate and hero of the American Revolution, who stood up against the established but corrupted British monarchy of his time on behalf of a nascent republic and was hanged for it after saying, \u201cMy only regret is that I have but one life to give for my country.\u201d   \n \nEvery member of the Buckley Program has passed  Hale\u2019s statue  outside Yale\u2019s Connecticut Hall, where he stands, hands and feet bound, above an engraving of his last words. In 1967, I watched Ronald Reagan pay homage to that statue in person as I looked out from the second floor room in Connecticut Hall where I was attending a seminar on the Constitution taught by Wilson Carey McWilliams. That same year, as I recounted recently, I watched living Nathan Hales who were Yale students in my own time resist the government in the name of the republic, risking their future fortunes and public honor by refusing conscription into the Vietnam War.  \n \nWhy don\u2019t conservatives stop dining out so lavishly on the follies of liberals that they\u2019ve abandon the kitchen to Donald Trump? The reason is that, by trading on hatred and fear, he has swept the Republican Party to power in ways that will enact enough of its anti-government agenda to roll back the New Deal (and possibly even Reconstruction) even more than Reagan was able to do, and enough to neuter their readiness to defend the Constitution against him. They'll owe him. They'll fear him. They'll bow to him, as the Roman Senate  did to Augustus . (If John McCain, Lindsey Graham and a few others find the courage and principle to prove me wrong, I'll gladly say so.)   \n \nConservatives who recently and loudly championed \u201cfree speech\u201d against \u201ccry-bullies\u201d of campus political correctness will melt like snowflakes before Trump\u2019s encroachments on the First Amendment. Touting the liberation of a \u201cmarket economy,\u201d they\u2019ll remain silent about the original Tea Party\u2019s assaults on crony-capitalist corruption of government. They\u2019ll keep on seducing and rewarding legions of young students who seek to prosper, not to emulate the courage and citizen-leadership of Nathan Hale.  \n \nBen Franklin, Richard Henry Lee, Alexander Hamilton, and the Adamses are writhing in agony. \n  \nJim Sleeper, a lecturer in political science at Yale, is the author of \"Liberal Racism\" (1997) and \"The Closest of Strangers: Liberalism and the Politics of Race in New York\" (199","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jim Sleeper, a lecturer"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"America's Founding Fathers Warned Us About Men Like Donald Trump","source":{"category":"Organisation","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"AlterNet.org","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170152444","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1351"},"name":"AlterNet.org","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.alternet.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.bartleby.com/268/8/11.html","http://files.libertyfund.org/pll/quotes/213.html","https://www.whitehouse.gov/inaugural-address","http://thefederalist.com/2016/05/02/yale-students-fight-college-censorship-the-right-way/","http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2016/10/31/buckley-event-spotlights-american-party-system/","http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-statue-of-nathan-hale-yale-class-of-1773-yale-university-new-haven-9928504.html","https://opendemocracy.net/jim-sleeper/die-is-cast-why-trump-can-t-help-but-try-dictatorship","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~license.icopyright.net/3.18566?icx_id=1071318","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.bartleby.com/268/8/11.html","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/americas-next-president-will-rule-roman-emperor","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~files.libertyfund.org/pll/quotes/213.html","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.whitehouse.gov/inaugural-address","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~thefederalist.com/2016/05/02/yale-students-fight-college-censorship-the-right-way/","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~yaledailynews.com/blog/2016/10/31/buckley-event-spotlights-american-party-system/","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~www.alamy.com/stock-photo-statue-of-nathan-hale-yale-class-of-1773-yale-university-new-haven-9928504.html","http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://opendemocracy.net/jim-sleeper/die-is-cast-why-trump-can-t-help-but-try-dictatorship"],"sequenceId":"695203121398","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T21:22:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:18:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/264379218/0/alternet"},{"url":"http://http://license.icopyright.net/images/icopy-w.png"},{"url":"http://www.alternet.org/files/styles/story_image/public/story_images/shutterstock_482940697.jpg"},{"url":"http://license.icopyright.net/images/icopy-w.png"}],"video":[]}}

The president's executive order banning Muslims and refugees from seven countries rivals Japanese internment camps for racism and spurred mass protests at airports Saturday. Mixed with this cruelty was Trump's ongoing tantrum about his inauguration crowd size and his popular vote loss. He and his puppeteer, Steve Bannon , declared the media the opposition party and picked an absurd fight with Mexico that Trump deservedly lost. \n\nDeplorable firsts this week included a sitting vice president attending an anti-abortion rally, a president muzzling the agency designed to protect Americans from environmental toxins, Trump\u2019s assertion that torture works against all known evidence, and a deliberate attempt to use his august office to perpetuate the debunked racist myth of mass voter fraud. \n\nSome of the horror was downright laughable, like Kellyanne Conway\u2019s Orwellian coinage of \u201calternate facts,\u201d Sean Spicer\u2019s (and apparently Trump\u2019s) murky understanding of how tariffs actually work, and the president\u2019s apparent belief that aerial photography, when it comes to the size of his inauguration crowd, is somehow unreliable. \n\nOne thing abundantly clear after this hellish week is that contrary to his assertions, the doofus-in-chief is not, \u201clike, really smart .\u201d Like, not really at all. \n\nHere are a few of the lesser reported idiocies and outright evils perpetrated by the Trump White House this week. \n\n1. Trump further blurred the line between the White House and his family business. \n\nThe flurry of theatrically signed executive orders and endless stream of moronic tweets issuing from the Oval Office probably managed to distract everybody from the fact that Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest are unprecedented for a U.S. president. He has not remotely divested from his companies, is on course to profit richly from his office, and has little interest in understanding the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. \n\nIn yet another sign that the White House is now an extension of the Trump Organization, the newly revamped White House website briefly  promoted  First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s jewelry line and modeling career. And by the way, you can purchase her products on QVC, the White House website helpfully informed visitors. According to the Washington Post, \u201cIt is not uncommon for the White House to note the accomplishments of the first lady in her official biography, but Trump\u2019s decision to include a detailed list of her media appearances and branded retail goods is unusual.\u201d \n\nSomehow, the powers that be got the message that this advertising was more than a tad inappropriate, and the mention of QVC was removed by Friday. \n\nThis is the same Whitehouse.gov  that was immediately purged of all mention of LGBT rights, civil rights, climate change, and services for Spanish-speaking Americans, obviously to make room for more important matters. \n\n2. He obsessed over the size of his inaugural crowd to a mind-bogglingly absurd degree. \n\nThe things Donald Trump has time for are truly stunning. A good portion of his first week in office was spent in a dogged quest to prove the fiction that his inauguration audience surpassed (or even rivaled) that of Barack Obama's. He dispatched spokes-twerp Sean Spicer to assert an outright falsehood about his crowd size on day one, and called the head  of the National Park Service to harangue him for tweeting the unflattering side-by-side (but accurate) comparison of the two inaugural crowds. \n\nOn Wednesday, his first major presidential interview aired on ABC . It was an absurd and idiotic boast-fest, in which Trump talked about the \u201cbigness\u201d of his new job, and the bigness of his inauguration. He spent an inordinate amount of time showing pictures he had enlarged, framed and hung on walls showing his inauguration from an angle that suggested the crowd was larger than the whole world already knew it was. It was flat-out insane. \n\nABC\u2019s David Muir asked Trump about his other big lie, the one about all the voter fraud he\u2019s been claiming happened. Trump doubled down on what would become his theme later in the week, and stated unironically, \u201cI will say this, of those votes cast, none of 'em come to me. None of 'em come to me. They would all be for the other side. None of 'em come to me.\u201d \n\nThere is just no universe in which these \u201calternate facts\u201d are true. \n\n3. He appointed two 20-something right-wing nutjobs to head up Voice of America. \n\nTrump and his chief propagandist Steve Bannon clearly plan to use every tool in their arsenal to spread their vicious, xenophobic propaganda around the country and the world. This week, Rachel Maddow highlighted the fact that immediately after Trump\u2019s election, the Republican-dominated Congress sneakily turned the once non-partisan State Department broadcasting outlet, Voice of America, into yet another tool of his presidency. \u201cIsn\u2019t that interesting?\u201d Maddow noted . \n\nTwo crackpot, 20-something campaign operatives were named the CEOs of Voice of America. One, Matthew Schuck, is a former blogger for the insane right-wing site, the Daily Surge. The other, Matthew Ciepielowski, moved to New Hampshire to be part of the Utopian Experiment, a libertarian paradise that was going to secede from the country. Or something. Their first assignment, of course, was to spread more misinformation a la Spicer about the inaugural crowd size. \n\nNo doubt they were Bannon\u2019s picks, since he has now openly declared that the media should \" shut up ,\" is the opposition party, and should just listen to the president. \n\nIt\u2019s worth quoting Maddow at length to convey how truly frightening this is: \n\nIt's one thing for them to call it an \"alternative fact\" when the White House presents a blatant lie to the American public. It is another thing for them to overtly try to build in a dedicated way with the resources of the federal government an alternative factual universe for their supporters to live in and we count on the political opposition and we count on the free media to sort out lies from truth in this country, particularly when there are lies told by people in power. But these guys really do also now have the opportunity to build their own media in a way that no president has ever been able to do so before. No president has ever been able to use the resources the U.S. government to have broadcasting resources like that at his or her disposal. But they've done it now and they've already installed their people in the corner office. \n\nYikes indeed. \n\n4. He showed a fourth-grade understanding of human rights, children's rights and women's rights. What, no spanking? \n\nIn the New York Times'  disturbing report on Trump's chaotic first week, we learned that the Trump team drafted an executive order to review almost every international treaty in case he might want to pull out of them. The preamble to this draft order is full of conservative talking points and a middle schooler's understanding of how the world works. \n\nPer the Times, the preamble explains that these mean old treaties are \u201cused to force countries to adhere to often radical agendas.\u201d Radical agendas apparently include human rights. \"As justification,\" the Times writes, \" it pointed to two United Nations treaties about children\u2019s rights and ending discrimination against women, stating they have been interpreted as prohibiting spanking and Mother\u2019s Day \u2014 echoing concerns raised by cultural conservatives.\" \n\nNeedless to say, they are not the concerns of any sane person. \n\n5. He proved on the world stage that he really does not get the whole free press thing. \n\nIn a cringe-worthy  joint press conference  with British leader Theresa May, Trump was asked a clear-eyed series of questions by a British reporter. \n\n\"Mr. President, you've said before that torture works; you've praised Russia; you've said you want to ban some Muslims from coming to America; you've suggested there should be punishment for abortion,\" she began. \"For many people in Britain, those sound like alarming beliefs. What do you say to our viewers at home who are worried about some of your views and worried about you becoming the leader of the free world?\" \n\nThe clown president did not answer, of course. He dodged the question completely and cracked a joke that unconsciously revealed his demented world view. \n\n\"This was your choice of a question?\" he asked May. \"There goes that relationship!\" \n\nTrump does not like these kinds of uppity women, and he\u2019s not going to put up with them. \n\n6. He made it clear that the White House does not want to hear from you. \n\nIn the first week of a new presidency, the new administration saw fit to close down the longstanding White House comment line  (202-456-1111) and direct callers to share their views on the White House website  or  Facebook page . Or perhaps tweet them. \n\nWhile it is sometimes seen as a fairly weak form of activism, the millions of Americans who want their representatives to resist the Trump agenda are calling their senators and House members in numbers rivaling the Tea Party.

If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. \n\nOn average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent - a very good year. \n\nSo you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old - give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nOver long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. \n\nHow does this happen? \n\nIf you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. \n\nAt about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds. \n\nFor people within a few years of retiring, the funds geared for retirement take a different approach. They ratchet back stock exposure in favor of investing options that are more conservative, putting only about 60 percent of your money in the fund into stocks. The reason is that stocks don't always climb like they have during the last few months, and if they go into a losing period, people on the verge of retiring might not have time to wait for another benevolent period. \n\nSo let's assume you are about 25 and started 2016 with $1,000 in the fund and didn't add another penny during the year. The fund manager handling your money would have put $800 of your money in stocks and $200 in bonds at the beginning of 2016. And now you'd have about $1,160. Most of the increase in your money would have come from the stock market. During 2016 alone, money in the stock market grew by about 12 percent, while bond gains were tiny by comparison - only about 2.6 percent. \n\nBonds are for fear \n\nIf you are like most people, you like making money. So after watching the celebration of Dow 20,000, you might conclude that you should put every penny of your savings in stocks. But there's a reason why a fund designed for someone at 25 has about 20 percent of the money invested in bonds, rather than using only stocks: Not all time periods are like the present, and you never know when the stock market will turn cruel. \n\nAbout every five years, and when no one is expecting it, a cruel period shows up called a \"bear market.\" It can destroy a lot of your money quickly and make you think it will never come back again. Historically, money lost in the stock market does come back, but it can take more than a year before you regain what's lost and start making money again. \n\nConsider the horrible bear market that came along with the housing crisis and Great Recession of 2008. The person with $10,000 invested entirely in the stock market lost so much they had only $4,980 left at one point and they were still waiting for a recovery after three years. The person with 80 percent in stocks and 20 percent in bonds didn't lose as much. At the worst point they had $5,980 of their original $10,000 left. And in a couple of years, they'd recovered and were positioned to make money again. And the person with only 60 percent in stocks at the beginning of the stock market plunge recovered in about a year and half. \n\nSo the moral of the story is you don't have to be a wallflower during the Dow 20,000 celebration - but party in moderation. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER \n\nGail MarksJarvis is a personal finance columnist for the Chicago Tribune and author of \"Saving for Retirement Without Living Like a Pauper or Winning the Lottery.\" Readers may send her email at gmarksjarvis@tribune.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"GAIL MARKSJARVISChicago Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Pensions news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Personal finance news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Gail MarksJarvis: Think you missed the Dow 20,000 party?

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale\u2019s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\u201cThe judge\u2019s order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US \u2014 it doesn\u2019t immediately order that they be released from detention,\u201d he told CNN. \n \n\u201cWe are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\u201d he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \u201cour courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump\u2019s controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \u201conly for nationals of countries for whom\u201d members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump\u2019s order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\u201cAmerica is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump\u2019s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump\u2019s order and pledged continued action. \n \n\u201cThis should not happen in America,\u201d Velazquez said following Darweesh\u2019s release. \u201cOne by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\u201d \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\u201cBecause the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK\u2019s Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\u201cWhen Mr. Darweesh\u2019s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u2018Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\u201d the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\u201cOur courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump\u2019s order puts those who have helped us in harm\u2019s way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, titled \u201cProtection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\u201cI am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security.\u201d \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cook","zipCode":"60601","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Chicago","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WLS-AM","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"187813487","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"221"},"name":"WLS-AM","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlsam.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/ny-immigration-order-stay/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695203125767","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

He traveled the United States, Canada and Ireland. He lived in Venezuela, Florida and Philadelphia. His favorite vacation spot was Sea Isle City, NJ every September. He loved the Lobster House in Cape May and shopping in Stone Harbor for Tommy Bahama Clothing. \n \nEarlier in life he attended McCaskey High. He then worked road construction with McMinns Asphalt then went into car sales, selling Hondas in Florida, Philadelphia and Jones of Lancaster and Toyota and Mazda. Tom then had his own pressure washing business, Under Pressure Inc., for 26 years until his retirement in 2015 due to his illness. \n \nTom and Celeste had an enduring love for Maine Coon Cats. They raised several and he leaves behind six who will miss him dearly. He also had a love for cars and bragged how he owned 36 cars in his lifetime. His last obsession was BMW's; you never knew when he was coming home with a new one. \n \nOther than his wife and animals he leaves behind his baby brother Bobby and his wife Heather of Palm Harbor, Florida, his sister Shirley and her husband Todd of Reading, PA and many nieces and nephews and one great nephew. He is preceded in death by his parents Robert and Dolly Shenk and a sister Sally. \n \n\"Tom, you were everything to me. You provided for everyone and people just gravitated to you because of your strength, your advice, and your hospitality. You were quite the entertainer in your Eagles and Packers Sports Bar in the basement. You followed and idolized the late great Vince Lombardi, studying what it takes to be number one. You were a leader not a follower and lived your life your way as Frank Sinatra. \n \nFly upward my love for I will meet you on the other side someday along with our beautiful cats, family and friends. Until then I love you forever, your shining star Celeste.\" \n \nI would like to thank the staff and oncologists at Keystone Cancer along with Hospice and nurses at Lancaster Regional Hospital for the wonderful care and support for us both. \n \nTo honor Tom's life, please make a donation to your local animal shelter. \n \nPlease join Celeste, to casually celebrate Tom's life on Sunday, February 12, 2017 from 2 to 6 p.m. at Four Seasons Country Club, Landisville, PA.

In 1981, his research interests shifted to the astronomy of the ancient Maya as recorded in their hieroglyphic books. In collaboration with his wife, they wrote Astronomy in the Maya Codices, which was published by the American Philosophical Society in 2011, for which they received the Donald E. Osterbrock Book Prize for Historical Astronomy in 2013. \n \nAfter retiring from teaching at Tulane at the end of 2005 (and in response to their experiences during Hurricane Katrina), they began spending the months from mid-June to the end of October in Gainesville, Florida, where they had appointments as courtesy professors in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Florida and as research professors in the Florida Museum of Natural History. \n \nHarvey Bricker is survived by his wife of 52 years, Victoria Reifler Bricker, his sister, Helen Bricker Smith, of Falls Church, Virginia, and her children: Matthew Bricker Smith of Uncasville, Connecticut, and Elizabeth Smith Hall of Eastleigh, England. \n \nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Latin American Library at Tulane University or the Latin American Collection of the Smathers Library at the University of Florida.

Born in Youngstown, Ohio, he was the son of the late Parley and Antonia (Vanaskey) Young. Morgan was the husband of Nancy I. (Schultz) Young. \n \nA true polymath (Renaissance man), Morgan believed a man could \"do all things, if he will.\" From crafting a table and rebuilding an engine to piping mash potato rose petals over slices of beef Wellington and playing bagpipes, Morgan exemplified a dying breed of citizen that knew how (and when) to do just about anything. Even if the task was something he would eventually hire another to perform, Morgan took pride in understanding the concept, the history and the practical implications of any tool or technique he came upon. \n \nBlessed with strong lungs and long legs, Morgan played tuba and ran track for Boardman High School. It was through his family's refrigeration business, however, that Morgan began his love for learning and doing as much as he could absorb. Once tinkering with compressor units became \"old hat,\" Morgan turned to donning asbestos gloves and a safety mask in the foundries of Youngstown Steel. Morgan later graduated from Youngstown State University, and sought a career that would provide him exposure to a myriad of businesses, personalities and complexities, as well as sufficient time to focus on his numerous other passions, like Cleveland Browns football, toy trains, hunting, fishing and cooking. Morgan became an agent of the Internal Revenue Service in 1973 and retired in 2003. Morgan spent the last years of his life tinkering, building, cooking (though never cleaning\u2026) and, from his recliner, making most Jeopardy contestants look like novices, as he mowed through any category with a seemingly endless supply of useless facts. Morgan could \"do all things\" (and he did them pretty darn well). \n \nSurviving in addition to his wife, Nancy, are his children: Adrian Evan of Lititz, Nicholas Owen of Greenbelt, MD, Benjamin Rhys of Landisville, and Keith Morgan of Landisville, as well as three grandchildren: Olivia Jaclyn Young, Rowan Zachary Young and Cadence Elizabeth Young, all of Lititz. \n \nServices will be held on Thursday, February 9, 2017 at the Charles F.

He said statistics shows that there are about four to six domestic workers for every 10 citizens according to the area and standard of living. \n \nHe warned the departure of expatriates will lead to price hikes and weakening of citizens\u2019 purchasing power which will obligate the State to shoulder more expenses in order to compensate citizens. Talking about jobs, Ramadan said the work load will be heavier for Kuwaiti employees who will be required to carry out more tasks. \n \nConcerning the private sector, Ramadan believes this sector will face a big problem because the departure of expatriates means that private companies will be obligated to replace foreign workers who receive low salaries with nationals whose salaries are high. He said this will reflect on the cost of production and then the prices will increase. He suggested gradual replacement of expatriate workers with citizens in certain professions. About the proposal to impose tax on remittances of expatriates, Ramadan asserted the expatriates are not allowed to own properties, acquire long-term residency permits nor invest directly in Kuwait so they have no other option but to transfer their money to their home countries. \n \nMeanwhile, Minister of Public Works Engineer Abdulrahman Al- Mutawa affirmed commitment of the ministry to have Jaber Al-Ahmad Causeway Project completed according to the time frame, and without delay, reports Al-Jarida daily. \n \nHe said the project is one of the mega developmental ventures under implementation in Kuwait that will propel the country toward the required growth if completed.

Kuwait on Wednesday executed seven individuals \u2013 four men and three women \u2013 in the Central Prison. \n \nThese individuals included two Kuwaitis (Sheikh Faisal Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah and Nasra Al Enezi), two Egyptians, a Bangladeshi, a Filipina and an Ethiopian who were found guilty in cases of premeditated murder, rape or theft and were hanged in application of the verdicts pronounced by the lower courts, upheld by the courts of Appeals and Cassation and endorsed by HH the Amir. \n \nIn a statement to Kuwait News Agency (KUNA), Assistant Foreign Minister for Legal Affairs Ambassador Ghanim Al-Ghanim asserted, \u201cThe death penalty verdicts pronounced by the courts were in cases of premeditated murders and the punishment was carried out after exhausting all levels of litigation. \n \nThe verdicts were based on indisputable evidence that the convicts committed the crimes as charged. The evidence included testimonies from witnesses and confessions by those accused of committing grave crimes.\u201d Al-Ghanim clarified the verdicts were announced following fair and public trials \u201cin which all the guarantees stipulated by the Kuwaiti law were provided and lawyers assumed the task of defending their clients.\u201d He affirmed, \u201cThe verdicts were upheld by the Cassation Court, the country\u2019s highest court, and became res judicata that could not be challenged. By carrying out the court verdicts, Kuwait did not violate any of the covenants it had ratified, in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Arab Charter for Human Rights, or international norms or the GCC Declaration of Human Rights.\u201d \n \nHe added the national laws of Kuwait provided multiple safeguards in the case of death penalty. \u201cThis is very clear in the fact that such verdicts are pronounced by a high independent and neutral judiciary in public trials where the accused are defended by their lawyers,\u201d he explained. \n \nIn a related development, a report published on the website of Vatican Radio (en.radiovaticana.va) said the Catholic bishops of the Philippines voiced their grief over the execution of a Filipina domestic helper in Kuwait and called on Filipinos to reconsider their stance on the revival of the death penalty in the Southeast Asian country. \n \nThe Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) mourned the execution of Jakatia Pawa in Kuwait on Jan 25, 2017, saying it should serve as a clear message for Filipinos to reject the capital punishment. \n \n\u201cThe fact that Jakatia protested her innocence to the end of her life only underscores the abhorrence at the death penalty and the sadness that we feel at Jakatia\u2019s death should make us all advocates against the death penalty,\u201d said CBCP President Archbishop Socrates Villegas of Lingayen- Dagupan. Pawa was accused of killing her employer\u2019s 22-year-old daughter in 2007, which she denied. \n \nSource: Agencies","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Philippines news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Kuwait news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Govt rejects criticism of move to hang 7 persons \u2013 Executions as per Kuwaiti penal code","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"M6K","state":"Ontario","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"West Toronto","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"Times Kuwait","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"442661835","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Times Kuwait","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://timeskuwait.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203141656","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(That sounds fancy, and rather Wall Street-ish, but the forward 4-quarter estimate simply tracks the dollar changes in the S&P 500 earnings estimate over the next 4 quarters, which is currently Q1 \u201917 \u2013 Q4 \u201917.) \n\nHere is the this week\u2019s data: \n\nForward 4-quarter S&P 500 earnings estimate: $132.91 down slightly from last week\u2019s $132.93 \n\nP.E ratio: 17.3(x) \n\nPEG ratio: 2.16(x) \n\nS&P 500 earnings yield: 5.79% down from last week\u2019s 5.85% \n\nYear-over-year growth rate of the forward estimate: +8%, up from last week\u2019s +6.75%. \n\nHere is the trend in the y/y growth rate of the S&P 500 forward estimate, a statistic all but ignored by the mainstream financial media: \n\n1/27/17: +8% ($132.91) \n\n12/30/16: +5.03% ($128.57) \n\n11/25/16: +4.03% ($128.56) \n\n10/28/16: +3.74% ($128.97) \n\n9/30/16: -1.18% ($125.09) \n\nThis site has been tracking the forward estimate and its year-over-year growth rate since the year 2000. We\u2019ve just finished a 24-month period from late 2014 to late 2016, where the y/y growth rate fell from the 9% range, to a low of -3% in early 2016, all due to the Energy sector drag. \n\nPersonally I\u2019d love to see y/t growth rate in the forward estimate of 10% \u2013 that will be the highest \u201cexpected\u201d growth rate in a very long time. The last time the S&P 500 earnings grew 15%, was 2011, a year when the S&P 500 suffered a 20% correction from May, 2011 through early October, 2011. \n\nWhat is truly interesting about the data is that \u2013 even prior to the US Presidential election \u2013 the S&P 500 forward earnings estimate was starting to rise rapidly. \n\nThere are several earnings-related articles in the pipeline.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Brian Gilmartin"},"topics":[{"name":"Stockwatch","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Earnings news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"SPX Earnings Update: Year-Over-Year \u201cExpected\u201d Growth Now +8%","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"CY","country":"Cyprus"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Investing.com","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"362107434","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"236"},"name":"Investing.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://de.investing.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203141892","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

On Friday, Jan. 27, President Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending all immigration from countries with terrorism concerns for 90 days. Countries included in the ban are Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, which are all Muslim-majority nations.    January 29, 2017 \nThe agency said the court order affected a relatively small number of travelers who were inconvenienced by security procedures upon their return. The department's statement said: \"President Trump's Executive Orders remain in place\u2014 prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,\" according to the DHS statement. \n \nStephen Miller, a senior adviser to the White House, said that nothing in the judge's order \"in anyway impedes or prevents the implementation of the president's executive order which remains in full, complete and total effect.\" \n \n11 p.m. \n \nForeign-born U.S. residents who could have been barred from re-entering the United States under President Donald Trump's immigration order have been allowed back into the country. \n \nThat's according to a Department of Homeland Security official who briefed reporters on Saturday night. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n \nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n \nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n \nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n \n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n \n9:40 p.m. \n \nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n \nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n \nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n \nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n \nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n \n7 p.m. \n \nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n \nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n \nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n \nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n \nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n \nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n \n1 a.m. \n \nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n \n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n \nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n \n12:20 a.m. \n \nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n \nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n \nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n \nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n \nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n \n12:10 a.m. \n \nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n \nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n \nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n \nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n \nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n \n11:50 p.m. \n \nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n \nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n \nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n \n11:20 p.m. \n \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n \nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n \nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n \nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n \nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n \nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n \n10:20 p.m. \n \nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n \nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n \nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n \nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \n9:50 p.m. \n \nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n \n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n \nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n \n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n \n8:30 p.m. \n \nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n \nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n \nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n \nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n \nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n \n8 p.m. \n \nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n \nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n \nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n \nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n \nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n \n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n \n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n \n7:05 p.m. \n \nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n \nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n \nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nTrump signed the order Friday. \n \n6:40 p.m. \n \nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n \nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n \nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n \nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n \nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n \nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n \n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n \n6:35 p.m. \n \nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n \n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n \nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n \nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n \n5:45 p.m. \n \nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n \nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n \nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n \nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n \nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n \n5:15 p.m. \n \nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n \nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n \nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n \nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n \n3 p.m. \n \nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n \nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n \nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n \nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n \n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n \n2:45 p.m. \n \nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n \nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n \nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n \nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n \n1 p.m. \n \nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n \nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n \nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n \nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n \n12:30 p.m. \n \nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n \nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n \nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n \nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\" \n  Subjects   People   Locations   Organisations","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Western Europe","countryCode":"DE","country":"Germany"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Mail.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170623893","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"107"},"name":"Mail.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mail.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203154807","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:11:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Privacy Policy \n\nor \n\nWASHINGTON -- A split runs through the heart of the American presidency. \n\nLooked at one way, it's a large, centralized bureaucracy designed to translate ideas into policy. From another angle, it's a man -- so far, always a man -- sitting behind a desk as the world's knottiest problems play on his quirks and insecurities. \n\nSeldom has the dual nature of the office been more on display than in the first week of the presidency of Donald John Trump. \n\nAll week, the White House rolled out executive orders and presidential memorandums, most of which were strikingly normal -- a word Trump's opponents hate to hear applied to him. \n\nThe rhetoric may have been sweeping, the scheduling startlingly ad hoc and the pace unusually hectic. But few of the actions, with the major exception of the ban on refugees and restrictions on immigration announced Friday, would have surprised anyone had they been taken by other Republicans, from Jeb Bush to Ted Cruz. \n\nThen there was the rest of it -- the displays of presidential id, unfiltered by retainers. \n\nIn speeches, interviews and off-the-cuff remarks, Trump obsessed about the size of his inauguration crowds, nakedly declared that he favors \"torture\" -- dispensing with George W.

That makes them only slightly hotter than the Wizards, who have won 10 of their last 12 games and 14 straight at home. \n   \nIt\u2019s a far cry from last month, when both teams were struggling (at least by their standards). Each team\u2019s ascent has been built on offensive production, but their postseason hopes will hinge on improved defense. \n   \nThe Capitals and their fans have learned, painfully, that regular-season success means nothing when the playoffs roll around. They\u2019ve won the Presidents Trophy twice before (in 2010 and 2016) and bowed out in the Eastern Conference semifinals each time. \n   \nIn fact, now that the Chicago Cubs have ended their century-long title drought, the Capitals may have the most nihilistic fan base in North American pro sports. Social media has been awash with fans wondering if Alexander Ovechkin and company are peaking too soon, 2½ months before the end of the regular season. \n   \nA bigger concern should be keeping everyone healthy and rested. Ovechkin is 31, and while he\u2019s still an elite goal scorer (only three players have more than his 23), he could use a few nights off between now and April to save his legs for the playoffs, as the San Antonio Spurs used to do with Tim Duncan and the Cleveland Cavaliers do with LeBron James. His title window is slowly closing, so the Caps want him as fresh as possible in the spring. \n   \nThe good news is that Washington doesn\u2019t live and die with Ovechkin\u2019s scoring quite as much as it once did. Seven other Capitals have at least 10 goals at the break, and for a change, all four lines are a threat to score. \n   \nAnd in his third season, coach Barry Trotz seems to have found the happy medium between the breakneck style favored by former coach Bruce Boudreau and the grind-it-out mentality of his successor, Dale Hunter. The Capitals have allowed a league-low 102 goals, with Braden Holtby a strong candidate to win his second straight Vezina Trophy as the NHL\u2019s top goalie. Yet they\u2019ve scored at least five goals in nine of their past 13 games. \n   \nYes, the playoffs are a different animal, and the Capitals annually seem to run into a hot opposing goalie. But they seem more constituted for a sustained postseason run than at any point in Ovechkin\u2019s career. \n   \nThe Wizards face a clear obstacle in James\u2019 defending NBA champion Cavaliers, but qualifying for the playoffs would be an improvement after missing them last year. And after beating likely playoff teams Charlotte and Boston on consecutive nights last week, they\u2019re establishing themselves as contenders. \n   \nLike the Caps, the Wizards can score. Entering Friday\u2019s game, they had topped 100 points in 12 straight contests, and they ranked 10th in the league in scoring (106.6 points per game). \n   \nThanks to the Golden State Warriors, today\u2019s NBA is a perimeter-oriented game, and the Wizards have one of the league\u2019s better trios in John Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter. Wall (23.1 points, 10.1 assists) would be an MVP candidate if it weren\u2019t for the dazzling seasons enjoyed by James Harden and Russell Westbrook. Beal (21.9) has managed to stay healthy for a change, and Porter (14.2) is in the running for most improved player. \n   \nThe Wizards are still behind the NBA curve in quantity of 3-point shots; only four teams have attempted fewer. But they\u2019re shooting a respectable 37 percent, with Porter leading the league at 46.5 percent and Wall slowly improving that facet of his game. \n   \nBig men Marcin Gortat and Markeef Morris are competent complements to the perimeter trio. The Wizards will need to improve their defense (they allow 105.7 points per game) and get better production from the bench, but if they can manage to earn one of the Eastern Conference\u2019s top four seeds, they\u2019ll be tough to beat at home in the first round. \n   \nThat\u2019s a long way off, and the hot streaks currently being enjoyed by the Wizards and Capitals could disappear like a 24-hour virus before the spring. Still, long-suffering fans in D.C. must find it refreshing to see their both of their teams healthy in January.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"STEVE DeSHAZO THE FREE LANCE-STAR"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"STEVE DeSHAZO: D.C. teams in no need for a cure to this fever","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Mecklenburg","zipCode":"23927","state":"Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Clarksville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169678424","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"252"},"name":"Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fredericksburg.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203160688","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T04:45:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again?

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 52 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Orleans","zipCode":"70113","state":"Louisiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"New Orleans","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WDSU New Orleans","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169699635","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"267"},"name":"WDSU New Orleans","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wdsu.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203161773","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n___ \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n___ \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n___ \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n____ \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from travelling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n___ \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n____ \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n____ \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 per cent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n___ \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveller from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n___ \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n___ \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n___ \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n___ \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n___ \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been cancelled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n___ \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signalled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n___ \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenceless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n___ \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n___ \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.

He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n___ \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n___ \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","zipCode":"R7A","state":"Manitoba","countryCode":"CA","zipArea":"Brandon Southeast","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Brandon Sun","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169744494","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"Brandon Sun","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.brandonsun.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203170089","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media.brandonsun.com/images/647*432/NYCR107-128_2017_181451.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It\u2019s not up to me.\u201d \n \nA few hours earlier, McGregor (21-3 MMA, 9-1 UFC) issued perhaps his biggest swipe at the UFC, boasting he\u2019d outdrawn the promotion after counter-programming the FOX-televised event with a sit-down interview streamed via online pay-per-view. \n \nOn Instagram, he wrote, \u201cI\u2019m so made! Heading to do a Q and A in front of 5000 fans! You read that right. That\u2019s more than UFC attendance tonight. (Expletive) the UFC. (Expletive) Floyd. (Expletive) boxing. (Expletive) the WWE. (Expletive) Hollywood. And (expletive) you too pay me.\u201d \n   \nAlthough he admitted he hadn\u2019t heard all of McGregor\u2019s words, White\u2019s pointed response was the most serious counter to the lightweight champ\u2019s brash form of self-promotion, which has frequently targeted the UFC as he\u2019s grown into one of its biggest stars. The executive didn\u2019t entirely take the bait, however, linking McGregor\u2019s statement to efforts to push an online product. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear all that,\u201d White said. \u201cHey, listen, when you\u2019re about to do a pay-per-view that you\u2019re charging people five bucks to listen to you talk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got to say some pretty crazy (expletive).\u201d \n \nAs the crazy idea of ever seeing Mayweather and McGregor in a ring, White shot that down, too. \n \n\u201cHere\u2019s what I think the chances are: About the same as me being the backup quarterback for (Tom) Brady on (Super Bowl) Sunday,\u201d he said. \n \nWhite previously made headlines when he offered Mayweather and McGregor $25 million each and a cut of pay-per-view profits to step into the squared circle.

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

The watch can also be locked or unlocked using a correct combination of short or long breaths. \n\nVoice recognition sometimes produces incorrect words when dictating a text message. Blowing quickly on the watch can erase words, while blowing on it longer will send the text message when ready. \n\nThe technique also works with smartphones. A user can transfer content from the watch to a smartphone simply by sipping it off the watch and puffing it on the phone. \n\nThe technology could have potential for people with disabilities, researchers said. \n\nAnother new interaction technique WatchOut uses taps and scrolling gestures on the case and watchband, outside the watch screen. \n\nThey are possible because of the watch's gyroscope and accelerometer sensors, according to the researchers. \n\n\"Other techniques that improve control of smartwatches have included 3D gestures above the screen, bigger screens or adding an extra armband,\" said Cheng Zhang, a PhD student at Georgia Tech. \n\n\"We wanted to show it could be done with existing technology already common on today's devices,\" said Zhang. \n\nOne demo app allows wearers to scroll up, down, left and right by swiping on the watchband. According to Zhang it makes it easier to interact with GPS maps or menus. \n\nThe study showed that scrolling on rubber watchbands was more accurate than leather bands due to the different friction of the materials. \n\nThey also created an app that creates eight touchpoints on the device's bezel. Rather than scrolling through a long list of apps, the user simply hits one of eight spots on the case to launch Facebook, for example. \n\n\"Smartwatches aren't very convenient when you're carrying something,\" Zhang said. \n\n\"That's why we wanted to create a technique that allows the user to tap the watch to accept or deny phone calls. Hitting the right side answers the call; the left side ignores it,\" he said. \n\nThe final project, TapSkin, allows users to tap on the back of their hand to input numbers 0-9 or commands. \n\nThe technique uses the watch's microphone and inertial sensors to detect a total of 11 different tapping locations on a person's skin around the watch. \n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"New tech lets you control smartwatches with just your breath!","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNPM"],"sequenceId":"695203175204","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:16Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There were many women, it's nice to see them compete hard and better their performances.\" \n\n\"It was quite chilly so not easy to come here so early in the morning but you were all charged up and thousands turned up to make this a success. \n\n\"The idea is to encourage people to run and lead good life. It's about becoming fitter and healthier to have a positive impact on your lifestyle. It's about spreading the message across. I'm looking forward to next year,\" Tendulkar said. \n\nResults: \n\nFull Marathon: 1. Abul Hossain (2:34.02); 2. Biswanath Pal (2:39.16); 3. Paritosh Roy (2:52.48). \n\nHalf Marathon (Men): 1.

It\u2019s not up to me.\u201d \n \nA few hours earlier, McGregor (21-3 MMA, 9-1 UFC) issued perhaps his biggest swipe at the UFC, boasting he\u2019d outdrawn the promotion after counter-programming the FOX-televised event with a sit-down interview streamed via online pay-per-view. \n \nOn Instagram, he wrote, \u201cI\u2019m so made! Heading to do a Q and A in front of 5000 fans! You read that right. That\u2019s more than UFC attendance tonight. (Expletive) the UFC. (Expletive) Floyd. (Expletive) boxing. (Expletive) the WWE. (Expletive) Hollywood. And (expletive) you too pay me.\u201d \n   \nAlthough he admitted he hadn\u2019t heard all of McGregor\u2019s words, White\u2019s pointed response was the most serious counter to the lightweight champ\u2019s brash form of self-promotion, which has frequently targeted the UFC as he\u2019s grown into one of its biggest stars. The executive didn\u2019t entirely take the bait, however, linking McGregor\u2019s statement to efforts to push an online product. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear all that,\u201d White said. \u201cHey, listen, when you\u2019re about to do a pay-per-view that you\u2019re charging people five bucks to listen to you talk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got to say some pretty crazy (expletive).\u201d \n \nAs the crazy idea of ever seeing Mayweather and McGregor in a ring, White shot that down, too. \n \n\u201cHere\u2019s what I think the chances are: About the same as me being the backup quarterback for (Tom) Brady on (Super Bowl) Sunday,\u201d he said. \n \nWhite previously made headlines when he offered Mayweather and McGregor $25 million each and a cut of pay-per-view profits to step into the squared circle. Mayweather dismissed the offer outright. \n \nSince that exchange, White said there\u2019d been no talks with the Mayweather camp and added his offer didn\u2019t signal a renewed interest in the bout. \n \n\u201c(I made an offer) because (Mayweather) was full of (expletive),\u201d White said. \u201cHe said he had made an offer, which wasn\u2019t true. So I made a real offer.\u201d \n \nIs there a chance, though, all the talk is just a prelude to a blockbuster? \n \n\u201cI\u2019ll be suiting up Sunday,\u201d White deadpanned. \n \nFor more on UFC on FOX 23 , check out the UFC Events section of MMAjunkie. \n  \nUFC on FOX 23 , Featured , Featured Videos , News , UFC , Videos","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Steven Marrocco"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dana White issues warning to Conor McGregor after Instagram outburst","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"El Paso","zipCode":"79999","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"El Paso","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"El Paso Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667696","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1721"},"name":"El Paso Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.elpasotimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mmajunkie.com/author/mmajunkiesteven","http://mmajunkie.com/author/justin-park","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/conor-mcgregor-boasts-5000-attendance-for-live-ppv-interview-and-declares-expletive-the-ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/dana-white-offers-conor-mcgregor-and-floyd-mayweather-25-million-each-and-ppv-cut","http://mmajunkie.com/events/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/events","http://mmajunkie.com/tag/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured-videos","http://mmajunkie.com/category/news","http://mmajunkie.com/category/ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/category/videos","http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"],"sequenceId":"695203175911","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:08:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

The \"sanitised\" report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). \n\nThe report, whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986. The very first sentence of the report's available (undeleted) page reads: \"Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\" It, however, later clearly said that \"assassination is the major near-term threat\" to him. \n\nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991. \n\nThe first section titled \"Key Judgments\" analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India's relations with the US, the then USSR and the region. \n\nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi's life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder. \n\n\"If Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures - including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India - were taken by the Indian President ......(deleted),\" it said. \n\nInterestingly, it also names P V Narasimha Rao and V P Singh, who could be the \"interim successor\" and \"likely candidates\" in case of sudden exit by Rajiv. Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991. \n\nIn a section, titled 'The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy', the report says \"In our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\" besides \"a fanatical Hindu\". \n\nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis. However, another section deals in-depth with Rajiv's mediation efforts to resolve \"the conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo.\" Besides Gandhi's possible assassination, the report also analysed various scenarios of his \"abrupt departure\" from the political scene before 1989. \n\n\"Although we believe assassination is the major near-term threat to Rajiv's tenure, any of several other events could cause his abrupt departure from the political scene before 1989,\" it said while listing out several other possibilities including \"his death from natural causes or by accident\". \n\nIt ruled out the possibility of a decision by him \"to resign out of frustration\", saying \"we see no signs of this and believe it would be out of character\". \n\nThe CIA report also noted: \"We suspect, however, that Rajiv would calculate \u2014 as we do \u2014 that he and his kin would be targets for extremist violence even if he left public office.\" \n\nIn a section called \"Implications for the United States\", the report says, \"We believe (Rajiv) Gandhi's death would represent a significant blow to US interests, regardless of the circumstances of the succession. We believe Indo-US relations could also suffer as a result of domestic political changes following Rajiv's assassination.\" The report assessed Rajiv's policies ranging from dealing with extremists, foreign relations (including Sri Lankan Tamil issue) to promoting acquisition of selected foreign technology among others, and their outcome. \n\n\"Although some of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's policies will continue to encounter serious resistance over the next several years, we believe his dominance of the Indian political scene is secure until at least the end of his present term of office in December 1989, barring his incapacitation or death,\" it said. \n\nThe report also dealt with the possibility of a \"national government\" taking over in case of a sudden exit by Rajiv, while discounting the possibility of a military coup in such a scenario. \n\nSeveral portions of the 23-page report were deleted before the CIA decided to release it under the Freedom of Information Act.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sri Lanka news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"CIA assessed Rajiv Gandhi assassination 5 years before he was killed","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNOm"],"sequenceId":"695203176530","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2016-05/21/full/1463832649-7793.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

To free ourselves from boundaries and self caging. is to grow our strength in character, trustworthiness, and responsibilities. \n   \nNew Orleans (PRWEB)  January 29, 2017 \n \nGrand Master Shi DeRu, a worldwide Zen traveler, lifetime Zen student and mentor will give a speech on High Conscious Health and Happiness and will conduct a short Zen workshop/seminar at Chinese New Year Annual Celebration on Shaolin Institute New Orleans campus, Feb 4th 2007, starting 11:00 AM. This seminar is a part of his 2017 worldwide Living Zen and TaiGong teaching tour series in quantum leap in high conscious health, promoting the path of grit with basic living principles of life. \n \nChinese New Year of Golden Rooster is here to stay until the dog year shows up on Feb 16th 2018. To connect the conscious nature with conscious beings in oneness, and connect yesteryear with this New Year, DeRu has been paving the way in both US and China for greater health and higher consciousness worldwide. \n \nTo do that, his worldwide Living Zen High Conscious Health teaching tour first Asian series in meditation and TaiGong training 2017 has been launched since December 24th in Shanghai China. That Living Zen is transmitting in quantum leap in global conscious communication on the path of grit with life principles in character and integrity. \n \nHe continued that Living Zen with quantum health teachings through many cities in Anhui, China and all the way to China's capital Beijing. He did not finish his first Asian Zen teaching series until Jan 12 when he did 2nd seminar and discipleship acceptance ceremony in Shanghai, traveling through Korea before he reached his 2017 first teaching stop in Washington D.C. on January 12th 2017. \n \nOn January 14th -15th in Washington D.C.he started his US teaching series on \"Living Zen\" with the theme of High Conscious Health Living and Natural Healing before his US southern teaching tour series. \n \nThe Asian New Year of Rooster teaching tour series on Living Zen with the theme of \u201c5H\u201d started from Shaolin Institute Atlanta campus on January 28th, New Orleans on February 4th, and Mobile, AL on February 8th. In this set of teaching series, he places the focus on \u201cLet it go so one can rise up with high consciousness.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt is time to let go of over-thinking and problem searching，\u201d said DeRu, \u201cTo free ourselves from boundaries and self caging is to grow our strength in character, trustworthiness, and responsibilities. That is to be truly free.\u201d as he stressed his statement. \n \n\u201cHappiness with a health body and a health mind is almost what everyone wishes to possess,\u201d as the Zen master clarified, \u201cHigh conscious intelligence, from Healing to Health with Harmony and Happiness penetrates and permeates into all the communities of Zen world, further prevailing into all conscious beings around the globe.\u201d \n \nAccording to DeRu, Zen sees one conscious world, and one conscious being with one breath and one source of origin, from nothing to everything, expanding to apparent visible world as one sees with naked eye. However; the invisible potentiality is unlimited and infinite. The high conscious intelligence continues its path to infinite potentiality to everlasting-limitless universe. \n \nDeRu further explained: \"Zen sees the reality of potentiality is in the emptiness within and between the visible worlds. It is that emptiness of potentiality makes the universe going with consistent and constant expanding in infinity.\" \n \nThis is how the Zen Master sees the world, \"The high conscious mind of the universe guides and decides the direction of the universe expansion and development. When one follows the heart of the high conscious universe, one believes and achieves one\u2019s dream with unwavering faith and confidence. One will eventually be intotal communication and merge with that of infinite oneness.\" \n \n\u201cIt is that Zen mind propagates and instigates Imagination which opens the 3rd eye to vision the infinite Potentiality of the true reality of the universe.\" according to DeRu. \u201cWe are all part of, and microcosm of the universe. Our body particles are universal participles and our atoms are part of the universe atoms. Our conscious Qi waves are closely connected with the Qi waves of the universe consciousness which set the parameter to guide each step of our path if we wish to discover within the happiness and health.\u201d \n \nZen philosophy along with Zen way of living has been in lead in high conscious living beings for thousands of years. Zen Master DeRu sees Quantum theory along with scientific experiment of quantum physics gives lights, like taking many pictorial shots of reality of the world, to ordinary conscious beings, believers and non believers alike to observe and see the truth of the world, and the conscious universe in communication and expansion with unlimited potentiality without time or space limitations. \n \nDeRu firmly believes, \"In that Zen world one begins to see, In lieu of the fittest and fiercest fight for victory and survival with competitiveness from the selected few, humanity leading all conscious beings together claim victory by synergy and cooperation with compassion and love.\u201d \n \nDeRu maintains, \"war and fierce competition is for ignorant self-serving few, leading to self-destruction, it is, he said, the synergy in peace with harmony in cooperation leading all beings to greater development in advancement of conscious beings.\" \n \n\"Leaving Newton as a hero of the past,\" he insists, \"we must move on, following vision of the Ancient Chan in all conscious, subconscious and superconscious communication, human beings shall explore further. seeing beyond and through that visible illusionary world into that true universe intelligence and wisdom, and see the true potential world beyond time and space with the guidance of Albert Einstein, Max Planck and Niels Bohr\u2019s scientific minds.\" \n \nMaster Shi DeRu a 31 generation Shaolin Chan (Zen) Master has been teaching Living Zen Mind and Zen meditation with TaGong for over three decades worldwide, especially in China and the US. \n \nHe has been hosting his Annual Qi Retreat in the US for the last two decades with various theme topics on health and happy living.

( Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer ) \n  \nOn Thursday, when the Colorado Buffaloes finally picked up their first Pac-12 Conference victory against Oregon State, junior George King noted publicly afterward that he and his fellow starters needed to start games with the same infectious enthusiasm that was displayed by the reserves-turned-starters that night. \n \nOn Saturday King and the rest of CU's starters did just that, setting an early tone by knocking down the Buffs' first four 3-point attempts while attacking No. 10-ranked Oregon with a defensive energy they maintained throughout a 74-65 victory. \n \nThe result ended a school-record 17-game winning streak for Oregon. \n \n\"They handled the lineup shift the other night like men,\" CU head coach Tad Boyle said. \"I was really proud of them for that, both the starters and the reserves. Then tonight we flipped it back and everybody responded to that as well.\" \n \nKing started alongside Derrick White, Xavier Johnson, and Wesley Gordon \u2014 all three of whom had started every game this season before Thursday \u2014 in addition to junior guard Dom Collier. \n \nWhile Thursday's dramatic shift in the lineup was conceived in part to send a message to a veteran group of starters that had carried the load through the first seven-game losing streak of Boyle's seven-season tenure, Saturday's return to form occurred with not only the regular starters playing with fresh inspiration, but with the reserves hitting the floor with renewed confidence. \n  \n  \nFreshman guards Deleon Brown and Bryce Peters combined for just two points off the bench, but they once again provided solid defense while protecting the ball (no turnovers in 19 combined minutes). And senior Josh Fortune, a starter for the first 16 games of the season, put together one of his more efficient performances of the season despite scoring only two points, as he contributed four rebounds, two assists, and a blocked shot in just 13 minutes. \n \n\"For a guy who has gone what he has gone through, starting the first 16 games and now he's come off the bench, he's handled it well,\" Boyle said. \"He's not pouted and sulked and felt sorry for himself. He just tries to play as well as he can when he's in there, and I thought he gave us good minutes tonight.\" \n \nSiewert surging \n \nFor much of the past two months, freshman Lucas Siewert has looked as if he might have been better served taking a redshirt season this year. \n \nYet starting with his first starting nod on Thursday against Oregon State and continuing in Saturday's upset victory against Oregon, Siewert has made his most meaningful contributions of the year. \n \nAfter going 3-for-3 on 3-pointers in his CU debut in the season opener, Siewert went 2-for-16 over the next 19 games before knocking down his lone 3-point attempt against Oregon State. Siewert also added five rebounds against the Beavers in his first career start, grabbing four of them at the offensive end. \n \nSiewert again provided a spark against Oregon, scoring five points in the first half and adding two rebounds, one assist, and no turnovers in 12 minutes. Once again Siewert connected on his only 3-point attempt, and he also tallied the first two made free throws of his career after entering the game with an 0-for-2 mark. \n \n\"Lucas has been practicing really well the last three weeks,\" Boyle said. \"I would say since we got back from Christmas.

The document covers the technical issues involved in a meet and confer, with an emphasis on being prepared with a solid IG framework and numerous considerations around proportionality. \n \n\u201cThis guide represents years of hard-won practical experience and contains advice around implementing the latest changes to the FRCP,\u201d explains LTPI Board Member Quin Gregor. \u201cIn developing this, while we found a few frameworks, these were either too high level or too in the weeds. None of these laid our vision of how we thought the process should be addressed. With our focus on legal technology and its application our advice is naturally more on the practical than legal. However, we have represented the legal framework as much as we need to within the LTPI purview. We've all witnessed too many drive-by Meet & Confers when one sides ignorance of the process led to shoddy client representation. With this guide, there is no longer any excuse.\u201d \n \nThe guide is broken into 4 stages: pre-conference, activities at the conference, post conference, and \u201ccommon pitfalls\u201d, providing practical guidance and checklist items and related strategic considerations to streamline the process and avoid any missed steps. It is a valuable resource to both the novice and the expert. \n \nThe project team members include Bob Rohlf (Exterro), Peter Pepiton (Dinsmore), Chris Paskach (The Claro Group), P. Sean d\u2019Albertis (Faegre), Kevin Clark (Thompson & Knight), Martin Tully (Akerman), Seth Eichenholtz (Mastercard), Quin Gregor (SigINT), Sunil Ohri (Stein Mitchell), and Noah Lauricella (Goldenberg Law). \n \nLTPI with industry partner ACEDS will host a webinar to discuss the guide and share best practices regarding the technical issues involved in a meet and confer. The webinar entitled \u201cMastering a Meaningful Meet-and-Confer\u201d will take place on February 23, 2017 at 1:00 PM EDT. More information about the webinar including how to register can be here . \n \nThe guide is currently open for public comment for the next 30 days by the legal community before being finalized and released. \nTo learn more about the Meet and Confer Guide, visit https://www.legaltechpi.org/Meet-and-Confer . \n \nLTPI is open to suggestions for new projects and accepting new project members. Requests for new projects can be submitted at https://legaltechpi.org/Projects-New-Project-Proposal or sent to programs(at)legaltechpi.org. \n \nAbout LTPI \nLegal Technology Professional Institute ( http://www.legaltechpi.org ) is a nonprofit legal association for legal practitioners who are involved in the use of technology utilized by the legal industry, including eDiscovery in litigation and investigations, and information governance. Sponsors of the initiative include the world\u2019s leading law firms, corporations, enterprise software companies, and litigation support providers.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"LTPI Releases Meet and Confer Instructional Guide","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"New York","zipCode":"10026","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"New York","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Forwardgeek","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"587990929","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Forwardgeek","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.forwardgeek.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGVnYWx0ZWNocGkub3JnLw==","http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hY2Vkcy5vcmcv","http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hY2Vkcy5vcmcvZXZlbnQvbWVhbmluZ2Z1bG1lZXRhbmRjb25mZXI=","http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGVnYWx0ZWNocGkub3JnL01lZXQtYW5kLUNvbmZlcg==","http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly9sZWdhbHRlY2hwaS5vcmcvUHJvamVjdHMtTmV3LVByb2plY3QtUHJvcG9zYWw=","http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sZWdhbHRlY2hwaS5vcmc=","https://www.legaltechpi.org/Meet-and-Confer","https://legaltechpi.org/Projects-New-Project-Proposal","http://www.legaltechpi.org/"],"sequenceId":"695203195472","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

That\u2019s how most games have been going for Temple in American Athletic Conference play. \n \nThe tale remained the same on Saturday night as Houston took down the Owls 79-66 at Hofheinz Pavilion. \n \nAfter breaking a three-game losing streak with a win against Memphis on Wednesday, the Owls (11-11, 2-7 The American) went back to their conference struggles on Saturday. \n \nTemple trailed 43-33 at halftime and things didn\u2019t get much better to start the second half. Cougars\u2019 redshirt-senior guard Damyean Dotson hit a 3-point shot to put Houston up by 51-35 with 17:43 left in the game. \n \nThe Owls responded to the 16-point lead with an 8-0 run to cut the deficit to eight points. Junior forward Obi Enechionyia, who led Temple with 16 points on Saturday, hit a midrange jumper moments later to pull his team within five points. \n \nFreshman guard Alani Moore scored a fastbreak layup with 11:16 left to finish off a 17-4 run by the Owls, bringing the score to 55-52. \n \nThe comeback was short lived. \n \nHouston redshirt-junior guard Rob Gray\u2019s 3-point shot at the 10-minute mark sparked an 8-0 run by the Cougars, and Temple was back down double digits less than two minutes later after another Dotson three. The Owls couldn\u2019t cut the deficit to fewer than six points the rest of the way. \n \nGray and Dotson led the way for Houston in the win. Gray scored 28 points and added five assists and seven rebounds, while Dotson turned in a double-double with 20 points and 10 rebounds. \n \nAlong with Enechionyia, redshirt-senior swingman Daniel Dingle and freshman guard Quinton Rose both reached double-digit scoring totals for the Owls. Dingle scored 15 points. Rose scored 11 points, nine of which came in the first half. He went 1-of-5 from the field during the last 20 minutes. \n \nSophomore guard Shizz Alston Jr. had scored 20 or more points in three straight games before Saturday\u2019s loss. Alston went 3-of-9 from the field for nine points against Houston, including 3-of-8 from 3-point range. \n \nThe Owls kept most of their offense on the perimeter on Saturday. Temple went 10-of-32 from 3-point range. As a result, the Owls had six free throw attempts in Saturday\u2019s loss. \n \nOwen McCue can be reached at owen.mccue@temple.edu or on Twitter @Owen_McCue.

Only later did a White House official, responding to a question, acknowledge that sanctions were not among the topics the two leaders discussed. \n\nIn the first week of his presidency, Trump has been noncommittal on lifting sanctions imposed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, in response to U.S. findings of interference by Russia in the election. Sanctions by the U.S. and its allies were in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and other actions in the Baltic region. \n\nBoth descriptions of the call focused on the positive aspects of a new American leader engaging with the Russian president. In a brief statement, the White House said the discussion was \"a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair.\" \n\nThe two leaders discussed \"a range in topics from mutual cooperation in defeating ISIS to efforts in working together to achieve more peace throughout the world including Syria,\" the White House statement said, using an acronym for the militant group. \n\nThe White House official who spoke after the statement was issued said Putin brought up several times that Islamic terrorism was a \"common foe\" for the U.S. and Russia. The official was not authorized to disclose details of the call by name and insisted on anonymity. \n\nAddressing topics not mentioned in the White House statement, the Kremlin said that the two leaders discussed the importance of \"restoring mutually beneficial trade and economic ties between business circles of the two countries.\" \n\nThe Kremlin also said that Putin and Trump spoke in particular about international issues, including the fight against terrorism, the Arab-Israeli conflict, Iran's nuclear program, the situation on the Korean peninsula and the Ukraine crisis. \n\nMoscow has applauded Trump's promises to rebuild U.S.-Russian relations, which have been pushed to their worst level since the Cold War by the Ukraine crisis, war in Syria and allegations of Russian meddling in U.S. elections. \n\nTrump signed a presidential memorandum on the plan to defeat the Islamic State group Saturday, including in it the possibility of teaming up with \"new coalition partners,\" suggesting that pairing up with Russia on counterterrorism issues wasn't off the table. \n\nWhen asked by reporters about sanctions on Friday, Trump responded: \"We'll see what happens. As far as the sanctions, very early to be talking about that.\" \n\nIn 2014, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region and backed separatists fighting government forces in eastern Ukraine, drawing widespread condemnation in Europe and the United States. In response, sanctions were implemented against sectors of Russia's economy, including financial services, energy, mining and defense. The Obama administration also sanctioned people in Putin's inner circle. \n\nShortly before leaving office, Obama also ordered sanctions on Russian spy agencies, closed two Russian compounds in the United States and expelled 35 diplomats that he said were really spies. These sanctions followed an assessment by U.S. intelligence that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump. \n\nTrump's tempered approach to U.S.-Russia relations has already raised concern among several European allies who believe keeping Russia in check is essential to regional security. Domestically, some Republican lawmakers have warned against easing sanctions and pledged to put them into law. \n\nTrump also placed calls Saturday to French President Francois Hollande, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Officials say Trump, Putin avoided topic of sanctions","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Merced","zipCode":"95340","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Merced","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Merced Sun-Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661579","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"15"},"name":"Merced Sun-Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mercedsunstar.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203206190","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

New job? New business? \n \nWhile 2016 was the year of the unexpected superlatives with Leicester City, Brexit and Trump, 2017 will be a year for businesses in Cornwall to drive growth and put all their woes behind them. \n\n Here is a list of 17 large and small growing Cornish companies to watch out for in 2017...  1. Trewithen Dairy, Lostwithiel  \n\n \nAmanda Hubbard, from Asda Bodmin, with  Bill Clarke, founder and chairman of Trewithen Dairy. \n \nTrewithen Dairy has recently signed a deal to supply Asda stores in the South West with its own branded milk. One of Cornwall and Devon's largest bottlers of milk, Lostwithiel-based Trewithen Dairy is now working with 11 of the chain's outlets in the region, having added six new stores to its roster. \n \nRead more:  Food revolution means Brand Cornwall is no longer all about the pasties \n \nThis year alone, Trewithen-branded milk sales have increased by 70%, notably in Asda's St Austell store, where about 3,000 units of milk are sold each week across the four milk lines. \n 2. Sam's Diner, St Austell \n \n\n \nSam's diner in Fowey. \n \nIt's been a good year for the American-style Cornish eatery company Sam's. The small business is expanding with a fourth restaurant at the Cornucopia Food and Drink visitor attraction in St Austell, which is expected to open later in 2017. \n \nNo stranger to the county, with long-established and successful restaurants in Fowey, Polkerris, Truro and Carlyon Bay, this new site will again combine classic American dishes with the diversity and flavour that the Cornish larder has to offer. \n \nRead more:  Pasty museum to be part of Par Market St Austell Bay Retail and Leisure Park revamp plans \n\n \nEmma Sixton, from Sam's, said: \"We're harking back to our original American influences but with a modern Sam's twist. We're really excited to be able to move forward with our plans for this site and enable more food lovers to be able to enjoy the unique Sam's style and great service. \n \n\"The façade will have a vintage 'Airstream' [caravan] aluminium-clad look that adds an extra bit of authenticity and the interior will be equally as quirky, which fits in well with our ethos of providing great food in a fun-filled and entertaining environment. \n \n\"We'll also be creating full and part-time jobs that will further add to the positive impact that the neighbouring Cornucopia development will bring when it opens next year.\" \n \nMalcolm Ball, the chief executive of WMC Retail Partners Plc, the organisation responsible for the site and the Cornucopia development, said: \"I'm really pleased that Sam's will be joining us at the St Austell Bay Retail and Leisure Park.\" \n 3.

Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. Qantas is offering refunds to any passengers travelling from Australia to the United States who are affected by a new entry ban. Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days. That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.\n\nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.\n\nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government.\n\nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.\n\n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\"\n\nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.\n\n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said.\n\n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\"\n\nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.

At that time, many other enterprises also tried to seek opportunities from overseas markets, but they did not move ahead and waited to see if FPT could succeed with its business before making decisions. \n\nFive to eight years later, some companies begin exploiting foreign markets. \n \nRelating the story, Binh said if everyone tries to \u2018play safe\u2019, they will waste time and miss great opportunities. Foreign markets have helped FPT grow rapidly, as they are vast markets which bring a high growth rate of hundreds of percent. \n FPT and Viettel, two large telecom and IT corporations, which have reaped initial successes from making outward investments, say they will join forces with other Vietnamese businesses to exploit foreign markets.  \nIn the last few years, FPT has been providing IT and telecom services to Cambodia, Bangladesh and Myanmar to get money to offset decreases in the domestic market. \n\nNguyen Trung Chinh, president of CMC, said foreign markets brought the 200 percent growth rate to CMC last year and he believes the growth rate would be even more satisfactory in the time to come. \n\nAccording to Viettel\u2019s CEO Nguyen Manh Hung, people should not think that business should grow in the domestic market first before trying to reach foreign markets, because opportunities may be missed. \n\n\u201cBusinesses can develop the domestic and foreign markets just like walking on two feet,\u201d he said. \u201cThe domestic market will get saturated, and therefore, foreign markets will be the playing fields for enterprises that want to expand.\" \n\nViettel\u2019s success in overseas markets has inspired many other enterprises. Vuong Quang Khai, deputy CEO of VNG, admitted that VNG learned many lessons from Viettel when developing Zalo. \n\nAfter four years of providing the service and attracting 60 million users in Vietnam, Zalo decided to march towards Myanmar and it has attracted 4 million users in the market. \n\nAccording to Khai, once obtaining 60 million users, it would be very difficult to maintain high growth in the domestic market. In this case, it would be better to seek new development way in overseas markets. \n\n\u201cWe thought if we failed in Myanmar, we would still attack other important markets in ASEAN, Asia and non-Asian markets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be good even if only two out of 10 markets bring success.\" \n\nTran Dinh Thien, head of the Vietnam Economics Institute, commented that it is the right time to apply policies to support Vietnamese enterprises so they can make money overseas.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Vietnam news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Southeast Asia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Vietnamese businesses make more outward investments 5 hours ago","source":{"category":"Government","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"VN","country":"Viet Nam"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Mic.gov.vn","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"198292571","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"Mic.gov.vn","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mic.gov.vn"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203214088","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Angelelli is about a minute ahead of Renger van der Zande, who is driving the No. 90 Riley for VisitFlorida Racing. \n\nIf Angelelli and his teammates can stay there, they would clinch a victory in Gordon's first Rolex 24 race in a decade and give Angelelli a win in his final race. Angelelli is retiring as a full-time driver and focusing on co-owning the team and running the Cadillac program. \n\nOther class leaders at the halfway mark: Joey Hand in the No. 66 Ford in the GT Le Mans class; Nicholas Boulle in the No. 38 Oreca in the Prototype Challenge class; and Jeff Segel in the No. 86 Acura in the GT Daytona class. \n\n--- \n\n12:30 a.m. \n\nThe Tequila Patron team has reason for some late-night shots. \n\nBrendon Hartley, driving on cold tires, turned into a Porsche driven by Wolf Henzler and crashed hard into the outside wall at Daytona International Speedway with about 14 hours to go in the Rolex 24 race early Sunday. Hartley's No. 22 Nissan came to rest near the bus stop and had to be loaded onto a flatbed tow truck and taken to the garage. \n\nHartley was leading the endurance race before his pit stop and was in second play at the time of the accident. Hartley was sharing seat time with Ed Brown, Bruno Senna Lalli and Johannes van Overbeek. \n\nThe wreck likely leaves the Cadillacs of Wayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing as the cars to beat in the twice-around-the-clock event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading in the No. 10 car, and after the wreck, pole-sitter Joao Barbosa moved up a spot to second. \n\nThe Tequila Patron prototype returned to the track after a lengthy delay to repair broken steering components, but it was 26 laps down with about 13 hours to go. \n\n--- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nWayne Taylor Racing and Action Express Racing, two of the three Cadillac entries, continue to lead the way in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe third Cadillac car has fallen several laps down, but is far from eliminated from the 24-hour endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. The No. 31 Action Express entry fell six laps back after making contact without another car, but had made up half the deficit with a little more than 14 hours to go in the prestigious event. \n\nRicky Taylor was leading the way in the No. 10 Cadillac for Wayne Taylor, having taken over for four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in a steady rain. Pole-sitter Joao Barbosa was third for Action Express, just behind the No. 22 Nissan. \n\n\"That time in the rain for me went better,\" said Gordon, who lost two spots on a restart in his first stint behind the wheel. \"You can sure tell the difference with the drivers who have done it before. The Cadillac is driving so well that helped a lot. That is one of the toughest things I have ever done. Sometimes it rains harder and then lighter. You are trying figure the dry line and the wet line. \n\n\"It is a little hard to see through the windshield when it is raining. That was tough. I am glad I brought it back in one piece. The car is 100 percent improvement in the rain from the last time. That last time I failed at it. I would like to do more of it. I was glad to turn it over to Ricky. The way the floor of the car is raised up it allows the rain to get away from the tires. The tires are good and the downforce of the Cadillac is amazing.\" \n\nSebastien Bourdais is leading the GT Le Mans class in the No. 66 Chip Ganassi Racing entry, just ahead of Ganassi teammate Tony Kanaan. \n\nPatricio O'Ward, driving for Performance Tech Motorsports, is tops in the Prototype Challenge class. \n\nAnd IndyCar driver Graham Rahal is out front in the GT Daytona class. Rahal is part of a solid lineup in Michael Shank Racing's No. 93 Acura, joining Andy Lally, Katherine Legge and Mark Wilkins. \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nMax Angelelli is gunning for a victory in what he claims is the final race of his career. \n\nAngelelli has promised that the Rolex 24 at Daytona is his last event and then he will move full-time into an off-track career. He's part of the management team for Cadillac Racing and co-owner of Wayne Taylor Racing. \n\nHe's running in this year's endurance event with brothers Ricky and Jordan Taylor, and the team added four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon to the lineup this time. Angelelli took over the car Saturday after Gordon had slipped to third, and he quickly drove it to the lead. \n\nSo why is he giving up racing? \n\n\"I am not the driver anymore. I get in the car very late and miss all the driver briefings and debriefs, and there's no time to do anything,\" he said. \"I use the yellow-flag situations to learn about buttons and switches because I have absolutely no time and am so much involved in managing the program for Cadillac Racing that it takes 100 percent of my time. \n\n\"There is not 1 percent focus on driving, and you need to be focused on this.\" \n\nThe Cadillacs are the class of the field and were running 1-2-3 six hours into the race. Without any problems, the team should be in contention for the overall victory. \n\nAngelelli wants to go out on top of the podium. \n\n\"That would be everything,\" he said. \"Then I can leave the second part of my life with a happy face and not in depression mode for the next 30 years.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nDaytona International Speedway is quickly becoming the world's largest slip and slide. \n\nRain has started falling and wreaking havoc in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. Cars are spinning and skidding off the 3.56-mile road course, and many are making the move from slick to treaded tires. \n\nAnd windshield wipers are getting as much work as paddle shifters. \n\n--- \n\n7:15 p.m. \n\nAustin Cindric's meteoric rise in auto racing now includes a strong debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. \n\nThe 18-year-old racer started the event for 3GT Racing and did a triple stint to open Saturday's twice-round-the-clock endurance race at Daytona International Speedway. It was the most track time he's ever had in the Lexus RCF GT3. \n\nCindric was thrilled that the team not only allowed him to start the race, but qualify the car in the GT Daytona class and run a triple stint. \n\n\"They trusted me to stay out of trouble, and I'm very grateful for that opportunity,\" he said. \"I feel like I represented myself well.\" \n\nHis father, Penske Racing president Tim Cindric, expressed his feelings via Twitter from the sold-out infield. \n\n\"Never thought I'd be watching him race the Daytona 24 at 18, especially the first 3 hrs of his first one. Great experience and opportunity,\" Tim Cindric wrote. \n\nAustin Cindric has been steadily getting seat time in various series and recently landed a full-time ride driving in NASCAR's Truck Series this season for Brad Keselowski Racing. He'll also run the four endurance races for 3GT, and is working on adding other events to his schedule. \n\n\"I drive everything. Anything I can get my hands on, I try to get behind the wheel and try to have some success,\" he said. \"As long as I can keep a parallel path between sports cars and stock cars, it's what I want to do because I am really passionate about racing. I want to be a race car driver. I don't want to be specialized. \n\n\"I want to be Jeff Gordon. I want to be the guy who wins a bunch of championships and then comes to do the 24 hours just for the fun of it.\" \n\n-- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nJeff Gordon's first driving stint in the Rolex 24 was far from ideal. \n\nGordon got in the No. 10 Cadillac with the lead in the early stages of the 24-hour endurance race Saturday and almost immediately gave it away. \n\n\"I just don't have enough experience in these cars on restarts,\" Gordon said. \"I didn't know which way to go.\" \n\nThe four-time NASCAR champion went wide and \"that was the wrong move.\" He got passed by two other Cadillacs and then spent of the rest of his double stint trying to get a feel for the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. \n\n\"I wish I had more laps coming into this, but I totally understand how the team has to balance it out among three other drivers,\" Gordon said. \"It's just good to get comfortable and get some good laps in and work traffic and the rest of the way it was really smooth and clean. I was having a blast, especially that second stint. I had a great time.\" \n\nGordon's teammate, Ricky Taylor, set a frantic pace after taking the green flag, in hopes of building a big lead that would take some pressure off Gordon. Instead, Gordon took over under caution and was in the car for a restart. \n\n\"Everyone was telling me, 'Build a gap, build a gap,'\" Taylor said. \"I didn't want to be the one to crash the car and then Jeff Gordon doesn't get to get in the car. That would be the worst. ... The plan was to give Jeff the car with a little bit of a gap. That wasn't how it ended up working out.\" \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nScott Pruett's shot at an 11th victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona ended when he crashed in his new Lexus. \n\nPruett is tied with Hurley Haywood for five overall victories, but he was unlikely to get another overall win because he's helped launch the new Lexus program in the lower GT Daytona class. A victory would have been a stellar debut for Lexus and earned Pruett an 11th Rolex watch. \n\nHe wasn't sure what caused him to wreck in his first stint Saturday. \n\n\"We were just putting in the hours, you know?\" he said. \"It felt like I got just a little nudge from behind. It could have been just the air taken off the rear wing 'cause we were in a pack or something, but it snapped pretty hard, pretty quick down in turn one and unfortunately it got into the fence on the left hand side.\" \n\nPruett was disappointed for his Lexus-backed team. \n\n\"This is not how you want to start,\" he said. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRicky Taylor took the lead in the early going of the Rolex 24 at Daytona and then turned the No. 10 Cadillac over to four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon. \n\nTaylor and the other two Cadillacs quickly proved to be the class of the 55-car field. They were running 1-2-3 in the first two hours at Daytona International Speedway and built a big lead over everyone else. \n\nRicky, younger brother Jordan and veteran Max Angelelli have enjoyed podium finishes in each of the last four years. Gordon joined the team this year and had planned to drive a double stint in the Wayne Taylor Racing entry. Gordon is making his first appearance in the prestigious road-course race in a decade. He finished third with Wayne Taylor in 2007. \n\nIn the GT Le Mans class, Ford had one of its entries out front as the manufacturer seeks to fill a hole in its racing resume after last year's banner debut season. Joey Hand had the Chip Ganassi Racing Ford GT atop the class, and Hand was part of Ford's historic victory at Le Mans last year. \n\nDane Cameron ran the first stint for Action Express and was the first Cadillac driver out of the car. He turned it over to Seb Morris in third as the Cadillac teams had put all but one car in the prototype class at least a lap down. \n\n--- \n\n2:30 p.m. \n\nThe 55th running of the Rolex 24 at Daytona is underway, with pole-sitter Joao Barbosa leading the 55-car field to the green flag. \n\nThe twice-around-the-clock endurance race began under cool temperatures and cloudy skies, with a threat of steady rain predicted for later Saturday. \n\nFour-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon started the race in the pits, with Wayne Taylor Racing teammate Ricky Taylor opening behind the wheel of the No. 10 Cadillac. \n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" runner-up and IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe, four-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and 2014 Indianapolis 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay also are in the field. \n\nChip Ganassi Racing, which has dominated the Rolex in recent years, has two entries. One of them includes Joey Hand, Dirk Mueller and Sebastien Bourdais, who won their class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans last year.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"The Latest: Jeff Gordon, Taylor Racing halfway home to Rolex","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Manatee","zipCode":"34205","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bradenton","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bradenton Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657775","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"626"},"name":"Bradenton Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bradenton.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203216054","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport, some of the 2,000 demonstrators chanted \"Let them in, let them in!\" \n\n- Better US-Russia ties? - \n\nTrump's friendly stance toward Putin, whom France and Germany accuse of seeking to undermine Western unity, is being scrutinized since he won the US election in November. \n\nThe White House hailed the call with Putin as a \"significant start\" to better US-Russia ties, while the Kremlin said the pair agreed to develop relations \"as equals\" and to establish \"real coordination\" against the Islamic State group. \n\nTrump took office last week with US-Russia relations at new Cold War-level lows amid accusations by American intelligence agencies that the Kremlin hacked Democratic Party emails as part of a pro-Trump campaign to influence November's election. \n\nThe president -- who has raised the prospect of easing sanctions imposed against Russia after its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 -- has cast doubt on whether Russia meddled in the election. \n\nIn a flurry of calls that began early in the morning and rounded out an already frantically paced week, Trump spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Putin, Hollande and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. \n\nThe conversations gave the US president an early opportunity to explain new policies that have baffled and unnerved much of the rest of the world -- particularly his order to temporarily halt all refugee arrivals and those of travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n\nEuropean leaders are also concerned about Trump's virulent criticism of NATO -- he has dubbed the transatlantic military alliance \"obsolete\" -- at a time when it stands as the main defense against Putin. \n\nBut in his call with Merkel, Trump agreed on NATO's \"fundamental importance,\" the White House said. \n\nThe United States provides significant funding to NATO, and Trump has urged other member nations to step up their contributions. \n\n- 'Extreme vetting' - \n\nTrump's pronouncement on Muslim immigration makes good on one of his most controversial campaign promises to subject travelers from Islamic countries to \"extreme vetting,\" which he declared would make America safe from \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n\n\"It's not a Muslim ban,\" Trump insisted. \n\n\"It's working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\" he told reporters. \n\nThe new protocols specifically bar Syrian refugees from the United States indefinitely, or until the president himself decides that they no longer pose a threat. \n\nThe legal challenge, which won a first battle in US District Court in New York, was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups after two Iraqi men were detained late Friday at JFK. \n\n- 'Greatest nation' - \n\nOne of the men, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, had worked for the US government in Iraq for 10 years. \n\n\"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world,\" Darweesh said after his release. \n\nMark Doss, a supervising attorney at the International Refugee Project at the Urban Justice Center, said Darweesh's detention and release showed the new policy was being implemented \"with no guidance.\" \n\nThe ban has also triggered a political backlash. \n\n\"To my colleagues: don't ever again lecture me on American moral leadership if you chose to be silent today,\" Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, tweeted late Friday. \n\nHis tweet was accompanied by the now iconic photograph of Aylan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian boy whose body washed up on a beach in Turkey in 2015 after a failed attempt to flee Syria's brutal war to join relatives in Canada. \n\nInternational groups and civil liberties organizations have roundly condemned Trump's orders. \n\n\"'Extreme vetting' is just a euphemism for discriminating against Muslims,\" said ACLU executive director Anthony Romero. \n\nRomero said Trump's order breached the US constitution's ban on religious discrimination by choosing countries with Muslim majorities for tougher treatment. \n\nIran answered in kind by saying it would ban Americans from entering the country, calling Trump's action insulting. \n\nBut the US leader did get backing from Czech President Milos Zeman, who praised him for being \"concerned with the safety of his citizens.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"International relations news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump vows better Russia ties, reassures NATO allies","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Yahoo!Xtra","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657675","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Yahoo!Xtra","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nz.sports.yahoo.com","publisher":"Yahoo!"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203219744","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter. \n\nTrump's order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency \"green cards\" or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States. \n\nHowever, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission. \n\nIt's not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n9:40 p.m. \n\nA federal judge in New York has issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued the order Saturday evening after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from seven predominantly Muslim nations who were detained at airports across the country as the ban took effect. \n\nCheers broke out in a crowd of demonstrators outside a Brooklyn courthouse as the decision, effective nationwide, was announced. \n\nThe order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nIt also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n\nIt was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n\n--- \n\n7 p.m. \n\nNew York City's Kennedy Airport became a scene of anguish Saturday for relatives of people detained after arriving in the U.S. from nations subject to President Donald Trump's travel ban. \n\nLawyers and advocates working at the airport say they didn't have a hard count on the number of people taken into custody after getting off their flights. \n\nYosre Ghaled was among about a dozen distraught people waiting at a terminal Saturday to see if loved ones would be released or deported. \n\nShe says her mother-in-law's sister had been detained. \n\nThe 67-year-old Yemeni citizen had flown to the U.S. to live with family because she is sick from heart problems and diabetes. \n\nTwo members of congress joined hundreds of protesters at the airport, demonstrating against the detentions. \n\n--- \n\n1 a.m. \n\nThe government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is taking exception to the Israeli prime minister's praise of a border wall to keep out illegal immigration. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Twitter Saturday that \"President Trump is right\" for building a wall. \n\n\"I built a wall along Israel's southern border,\" he wrote. \"It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" \n\nMexico's Foreign Ministry said in a communique that it had expressed its \"profound surprise, rejection and disappointment in the prime minister's message on Twitter\" to Israel's ambassador. \"Mexico is Israel's friend and should be treated as such.\" \n\n---- \n\n12:20 a.m. \n\nPresident Donald Trump says his crackdown on refugees and citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries \"is not a Muslim ban.\" \n\nA day after signing an executive order implementing the ban immediately, Trump says it's \"working out very nicely.\" \n\nBut confusion, worry and outrage boiled over Saturday as airlines blocked people from traveling to the United States and legal challenges were mounted. \n\nIncluded is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The U.S. refugee program is suspended for 120-days. \n\nTrump's order imposed the most aggressive ban on Syrians, indefinitely blocking entry to the U.S. by anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war. \n\n--- \n\n12:10 a.m. \n\nAirlines around the world are turning away passengers, refunding tickets and rebooking flights in the aftermath of President Donald Trump's immigration order. \n\nThe order signed Friday included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen. It also suspended the U.S. refugee program for four months. \n\nThat forced airlines to tell some customers they couldn't proceed on flights to the U.S. \n\nDubai-based Emirates said a small number of its passengers were affected Saturday, and it was helping them rebook. Delta Air Lines and British Airways both said they were offering refunds for passengers who couldn't complete their trips. \n\nSeveral airlines, including Qatar Airways, posted travel alerts on their websites warning customers about the changes. \n\n---- \n\n11:50 p.m. \n\nIn Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says his country's decision to not issue give Americans visas will not be retroactive. \n\nZarif says on Twitter: \"Unlike the U.S., our decision is not retroactive. All with valid Iranian visa will be gladly welcomed.\" \n\nU.S. visa restrictions that took effect on Saturday for people from several countries, including Iran, ban travel even for those who already had American visas. \n\n---- \n\n11:20 p.m. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a message for refugees rejected by U.S. President Donald Trump: Canada will take you. \n\nTrudeau tweeted Saturday \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada .\" \n\nTrudeau also tweeted a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at Toronto's airport. \n\nTrudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected in late 2015. \n\nThe young prime minister has been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. His government has been trying to balance his liberal view of the world while not offending the new Trump administration. \n\nMore than 75 percent of Canada's exports are to the U.S. \n\n--- \n\n10:20 p.m. \n\nAn Iraqi who was detained overnight at a New York City airport because of President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from certain Muslim nations has called America \"the land of freedom\" after being released from custody. \n\nHameed Khalid Darweesh worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army when it invaded Iraq in 2003. Later he was a contract engineer for the U.S. \n\nHe was granted permission to relocate to the U.S., but was detained along with another traveler from Iraq after arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport Friday night. \n\nLawyers petitioned a federal court early Saturday to let them go. Two Democratic U.S. Representatives, Nydia Velazquez and Jerrold Nalder, were at the airport trying to get 11 other detainees released. \n\nAfter he was freed Saturday, Darweesh told a waiting crowd that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n\n--- \n\n9:50 p.m. \n\nIn Somalia, people are reacting with dismay and warnings that countries could retaliate against the United States' new immigration and visa policies with restrictive policies of their own. \n\n\"I am shocked beyond words. This will mean that my new husband will never be able to join me in the U.S.,\" said Fatima Ashkir, a Somali-American woman from Florida who came to Mogadishu to marry her Somali boyfriend. \n\nOthers say they are not surprised at President Donald Trump's executive order imposing a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia. \n\n\"His intentions of hurting rather than to help were clear from the very beginning,\" said Ahmed Abdullahi, a university student in Mogadishu. \"But you have to know that this will have a serious effect on relations between Americans and the Muslim world. A tit-for-tat response by Muslim countries, in which Americans could be barred from entering countries affected, is likely to be seen.\" \n\n--- \n\n8:30 p.m. \n\nIran's foreign ministry is suggesting the country will limit issuing visas to American tourists in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump's suspension of immigration and visas for nationals from Muslim countries including Iran. \n\nThe official IRNA news agency Saturday carried a statement by the Iranian foreign ministry that says Iran will resort to \"counteraction\" to Trump's executive order. \n\nThe statement says: \"Iran, to defend the dignity of the great Iranian nation, will implement the principle of reciprocity until the removal of the insulting restriction against Iranian nationals.\" \n\nThe statement adds: \"It will apply corresponding legal, consular and political actions.\" \n\nThe two countries have had no diplomatic relations since 1979 when militants stormed the U.S. embassy. \n\n--- \n\n8 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say five U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants from one family who have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy airport would return to Iraq. \n\nThey said the five will spend Saturday night at Cairo airport and leave for Irbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, Sunday morning. \n\nThey added that the sixth U.S.-bound migrant, a Yemeni national, left the airport to return to Cairo, where he resides. \n\nThe officials said Saturday's action by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the six migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts in JFK airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n(This story corrects the number of U.S.-bound Iraqi migrants to five, not six) \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nDutch airline KLM says it has had to turn away seven would-be passengers because they would no longer have been accepted into the United States under President Donald Trump's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations. \n\nManel Vrijenhoek, at KLM's press office, said: \"We would love to bring them there. That's not the problem. It's just that this is what the U.S. sprang on the rest of the world \u2014 that these people are no longer welcome.\" \n\nShe said the seven were due to fly with KLM from different airports around the world. Vrijenhoek said she had no specifics on their nationalities, although she confirmed they were from countries affected by the three-month immigration ban: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nTrump signed the order Friday. \n\n--- \n\n6:40 p.m. \n\nA U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States. \n\nThat covers legal permanent residents \u2014 green card holders \u2014 and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days. \n\nThe official says there's an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it's unclear how that exemption will be applied. \n\nThe official says visa and green card holders already in the U.S. will be allowed to stay. \n\nThe official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump's order is being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity. \n\nCustoms and Border Protection is notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S., and the airlines are being told to keep them off those flights. \n\n\u2014 Alicia Caldwell \n\n--- \n\n6:35 p.m. \n\nIsrael's leader has endorsed President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Saturday that Israel's wall along its border with Egypt has been successful in stopping a swell of African migrants. \n\n\"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea,\" he wrote, with images of the Israeli and American flag. \n\nThe tweet marked a rare public foray for the Israeli leader into a charged American domestic affair. The two leaders spoke earlier this week and Netanyahu is planning to visit Trump in the White House next month. \n\nAfter repeated clashes with President Obama, Netanyahu has high expectations for Trump, who has signaled he will take a kinder approach. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nMalala Yousafzai, shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban in 2012 to stop her campaigning for girls' education and co-winner of the 2014 Nobel peace prize, says she is heart-broken by U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on refugees from entering the United States for four months. \n\nThe order Friday suspends a program that saw around 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice resettled in the U.S. last year. Trump indefinitely blocked people fleeing Syria's civil war, and imposed a 90-day ban on U.S. entry from seven Muslim majority nations. \n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yousafzai implores Trump \"not to turn his back on the world's most defenseless children and families.\" \n\nRefugees and immigrants, she says, have \"helped build your country.\" \n\nTrump's mother was born in Scotland. \n\n--- \n\n5:15 p.m. \n\nQatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel. \n\nA statement on the company's website says: \"Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.\" \n\nIt listed foreign government, United Nations, international organization and NATO visas. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya. \n\n--- \n\n3 p.m. \n\nCairo airport officials say seven U.S.-bound migrants \u2014 six from Iraq and one from Yemen \u2014 have been prevented from boarding an EgyptAir flight to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe officials said the action Saturday by the airport was the first since President Donald Trump imposed a three-month ban on refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. \n\nThe officials said the seven migrants, escorted by officials from the U.N. refugee agency, were stopped from boarding the plane after authorities at Cairo airport contacted their counterparts at the Kennedy airport. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. \n\n\u2014 Hamza Hendawi. \n\n--- \n\n2:45 p.m. \n\nThe head of a leading refugee aid agency says President Donald Trump's decision to ban Syrian refugees hurts innocents fleeing violence. \n\nJan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council tells The Associated Press on Saturday that Trump's decision \"will not make America safer, it will make America smaller and meaner.\" \n\nTrump on Friday suspended refugee admissions for four months and indefinitely banned those from war-torn Syria, pending program changes that are to ensure refugees won't harm national security. \n\nEgeland says the decision dealt a \"mortal blow\" to the idea of international responsibility for those fleeing persecution. He says the U.S. is leading a \"race to the bottom\" in which politicians in wealth countries provide \"zero moral leadership.\" \n\n--- \n\n1 p.m. \n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani says the time has come for removing walls between nations rather that building new ones. \n\nRouhani did not name any particular country but his remarks come shortly after President Donald Trump's executive order Friday suspending all immigration and visa processes for nationals from a handful of countries with terrorism concerns, including Iran, for 90 days. \n\nRouhani said Saturday that, \"It is not the day for creating distance among nations.\" \n\nSpeaking at a tourism conference broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said that those seeking to create such walls, \"have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed years ago.\" \n\n--- \n\n12:30 p.m. \n\nThe International Rescue Committee is calling President Donald Trump's suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program a \"harmful and hasty\" decision. \n\nIn a statement issued late Friday night after the suspension was announced, IRC President David Miliband said, \"America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope.\" \n\nThe IRC statement declared that the U.S. vetting process for prospective refugees is already robust \u2014 involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by \"12 to 15 government agencies.\" \n\nMiliband praised The United States' record as a resettlement destination and said, \"This is no time for America to turn its back on people ready to become patriotic Americans.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Libya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Israel news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Latest: Official says ruling will not affect travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Centre","zipCode":"16823","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bellefonte","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Centre Daily Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657424","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"756"},"name":"Centre Daily Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.centredaily.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203223152","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:17:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Without funds for an attorney, I accepted deferred probation. It has followed me my entire life. \n \nI graduated from college, law, and graduate school, yet I had to endure a hearing to ascertain my fitness to practice. It also caused employment rejection. \n \nLater, as assistant county attorney in El Paso, and elected district attorney in Willacy County, I routinely dismissed pot cases. Prosecutor\u2019s offices have limited budgets, yet mountains of cases. Dismissing marijuana offenses, allowed me to send more dangerous criminals to prison. \n \nEven probation for pot was wasteful. Curfews and reporting requirements should be for prowlers and burglars, not pot smokers. \n \nThis problem persists, as 620,000 Americans were arrested for pot last year. Yes, illegal marijuana creates jobs for probation officers, prosecutors, bailiffs, chemists, clerical staff and many more; however taxpayers get soaked. \n \nCalifornia and three other states legalized marijuana on Nov. 8. Voters were persuaded by the Colorado experience, where $2.4 billion in revenues and 17,000 jobs were created in legalization\u2019s first year. Some of this boom comes from visiting Texans. \n \nThe Denver Post polled, \u201cWould you repeal legalization?\u201d The answer; \u201cNo\u201d, by a 51 percent to 36 percent margin. Gallup\u2019s 2016 poll showed support for legalization has grown to 60 percent nationally, and recent studies demonstrate no increased use among youngsters since legalization. Colorado is booming, and other states want what they\u2019re smoking. \n \nThe old \u201cReefer Madness\u201d arguments against marijuana have been dispelled. Today\u2019s legalization opponents such as Insys Therapeutics, which develops synthetic painkillers, poured $500,000 into the \u201cNo\u201d vote in Arizona. It\u2019s these legal painkillers which cause so much addiction and harm. \n \nPrescription drugs increase our health costs and Big Pharma doesn\u2019t want competition. The Catholic Church was also a huge contributor, with the Boston Archdiocese donating $850,000 to oppose Massachusetts\u2019 marijuana initiative. \n \nOne lingering anti-pot argument is that people will ingest and drive. This happens anyway and it will be illegal everywhere. \n \nNot satisfied, opponents wonder how they will test for marijuana. Field tests still work, but how about we just arm each officer with a chocolate bar, and they could cuff the stoned drivers as they grab for it. \n \nLegalization will come eventually, as it\u2019s only the oldest age groups who are opposed. \n \nAn estimated 15 million Americans use marijuana regularly, and about half our population has admitted trying marijuana. \n \nMarijuana decriminalization bills for the 2017 Texas Legislature, have been filed, including one by El Paso\u2019s own Joe Moody. \n \nRepublicans are increasingly in favor, because of the fiscal benefits and individual freedom arguments. Democrats are already there, and almost everyone wants to decrease the power of the violent drug cartels who smuggle pot across our border. \n \nLet\u2019s legalize it, and have Mexico put up the wall to keep Texans from trafficking marijuana into their country. \n \nEl Paso attorney Steve Fischer has been a professor of criminology and a Texas State Bar director.

Opening five minutes was a white wave. We probably had four or five grade-A\u2019s and they come down and score,\u201d Niagara head coach Dave Burkholder said. \n \nWith seven minutes remaining, Barach had a quick break from the blue line toward Teichroeb\u2019s net. Teichroeb made a first save with his right leg on a deke attempt, but the rebound was not cleared by NU and Charbonneau stuffed the puck into the open goal. \n \nNU nearly escaped the first only trailing by one, but with 12 seconds remaining on the power play, Barach dished a pass across the center of the Niagara penalty kill to Taylor Best, who\u2019s slap shot put Mercyhurst up 2-0 just before the end of the period on the power play. \n \n\u201cThat really set us back,\u201d Burkholder said. \n \nIn the second period, Mercyhurst carried over their late momentum and built on it with an early four-minute penalty kill that Niagara could not score on. \n \nAs the period continued, Mercyhurst took momentum from the extended penalty kill. That boiled over into the Lakers third goal of the game.  \n \nMichael Verboom received a pass from the corner to Teichroeb\u2019s left from Wes Baker in the high slot. Verboom\u2019s low shot was kicked out by Teichroeb but the rebound stayed in the slot where Stephen Hreoriak picked up it up and shoveled into the Niagara net, extending the lead to 3-0 with five minutes remaining in the final period. \n \n\u201cThat penalty kill changes momentum for sure for them, they did a good job,\u201d Burkholder said. \u201cThey made it look pretty easy. That\u2019s the turning point in the game.\u201d \n \nIn the third period, frustrations boiled over for Niagara. Christian Cakebread was injured on a high check midway through the period. \n \nCakebread skated off on his own, but Burkholder called it a long term, upper body injury. Another addition to Niagara\u2019s injury report which has hampered the team throughout the season. \n \nBurkholder would not comment, but he indicated he did not think the hit was clean. Neither did the Purple Eagles players, as six penalties were handed out to Niagara in the final half of the third period alone.  \n \nDuring the NU rush to the penalty box, Mercyhurst netted a goal with nine minutes remaining as Lancaster fired a shot through traffic the beat Teichroeb high, giving the Lakers a 4-0 lead that they\u2019d escape Dwyer with. \n \nSince topping Bentley on Jan. 14, Niagara has lost five games in a row. The Purple Eagles will host Canisius College on Tuesday. ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Failure to capitalize on chances leads to NU hockey loss","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Niagara","zipCode":"14302","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Niagara Falls","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Niagara Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169790986","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"8"},"name":"Niagara Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.niagara-gazette.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203226228","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Jay Inslee blasted President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning people from certain Muslim-majority nations as \u201cunjustifiable cruelty,\u201d and about 1,000 pro-immigration protesters gathered Saturday at Seattle-Tacoma Airport. \n \nAttorneys from the ACLU and the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project said a Somali national was not allowed to enter and two other people were detained at the airport. \n \nDoug Honig, a spokesman for the ACLU of Washington state told the Seattle Times that U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Zilly in Seattle granted a motion for an emergency stay of the executive order to prevent the two people who were detained from being sent out of the country on flight to Dubai. \n \nTrump signed an executive order Friday that bans legal U.S. residents and visa-holders from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the U.S. for 90 days and puts an indefinite hold on a program resettling Syrian refugees. \n \nAt a fiery news conference denouncing Trump\u2019s order, Inslee said he had met with a woman, a U.S. citizen, whose husband was denied entry at Sea-Tac airport after flying from Vienna. It wasn\u2019t clear if Inslee was speaking about the same traveler or if multiple people were detained. \n \nThe United States \u201callowed her husband to get on a plane in Vienna but didn\u2019t let him go the six feet across this gate to embrace his wife,\u201d Inslee said of the man. \n \nInslee said he was trying to get details on those turned away and had spoken with someone in the Trump administration by phone. He compared Trump\u2019s order to the detention of Japanese Americans after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. \n \n\u201cThe manifest and unjustifiable cruelty caused by President Trump\u2019s executive order is now on full display here at Seattle International Airport, and the gross incompetence and ineffectiveness of this action . is on full display here at Seattle,\u201d Inslee said. \n \nIn a statement, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said Trump\u2019s executive order was \u201cun-American and unconstitutional.\u201d \n \n\u201cMy team and I are working this weekend to explore our options to oppose this illegal action,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThe rule of law applies to everyone \u2013 including President Trump \u2013 and I will use the authority of my office to hold him accountable to it.\u201d \n \nAt Sea-Tac protesters holding signs and chanting \u201cno hatred, no fear, immigrants are welcome here\u201d gathered Saturday evening. \n \nAayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women\u2019s March. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\u201d said Khalaf, 29. \n \nMeanwhile, protesters briefly shut down a light rail line at Portland International Airport, and hundreds of protesters also converged at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York where 12 refugees were detained Saturday under the order. \n \nAP \n  Wararka iyo Barnaamijyada Radio Kulmiye si aad u dhageysato garaac  USA: 0016054755246 / 0017124329566  Switzerland: 0041445133004  UK: 00443309981135  Sweden: 0046812410569  Belgium: 003223","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Radio kulmiye"},"topics":[],"title":"Inslee calls Trump order \u2018cruelty\u2019protests at seat-tac","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"SO","country":"Somalia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"RadioKulmiye.net","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597898610","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"RadioKulmiye.net","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://radiokulmiye.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203231286","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:15Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

It\u2019s not up to me.\u201d \n \nA few hours earlier, McGregor (21-3 MMA, 9-1 UFC) issued perhaps his biggest swipe at the UFC, boasting he\u2019d outdrawn the promotion after counter-programming the FOX-televised event with a sit-down interview streamed via online pay-per-view. \n \nOn Instagram, he wrote, \u201cI\u2019m so made! Heading to do a Q and A in front of 5000 fans! You read that right. That\u2019s more than UFC attendance tonight. (Expletive) the UFC. (Expletive) Floyd. (Expletive) boxing. (Expletive) the WWE. (Expletive) Hollywood. And (expletive) you too pay me.\u201d \n   \nAlthough he admitted he hadn\u2019t heard all of McGregor\u2019s words, White\u2019s pointed response was the most serious counter to the lightweight champ\u2019s brash form of self-promotion, which has frequently targeted the UFC as he\u2019s grown into one of its biggest stars. The executive didn\u2019t entirely take the bait, however, linking McGregor\u2019s statement to efforts to push an online product. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear all that,\u201d White said. \u201cHey, listen, when you\u2019re about to do a pay-per-view that you\u2019re charging people five bucks to listen to you talk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got to say some pretty crazy (expletive).\u201d \n \nAs the crazy idea of ever seeing Mayweather and McGregor in a ring, White shot that down, too. \n \n\u201cHere\u2019s what I think the chances are: About the same as me being the backup quarterback for (Tom) Brady on (Super Bowl) Sunday,\u201d he said. \n \nWhite previously made headlines when he offered Mayweather and McGregor $25 million each and a cut of pay-per-view profits to step into the squared circle.

While much of the talk this time of year is surrounding Super Bowl LI, all 32 NFL teams, including the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons , had their eyes glued to the television Saturday to get a final glimpse at the nation\u2019s top senior draft prospects. \n \nLast season, Carson Wentz made a name for himself at the Senior Bowl, which ultimately led to the Philadelphia Eagles trading up to draft him with their No. 2 overall selection. First-year Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott also used the Senior Bowl to help catapult his draft stock. The list goes on and on for current NFL stars whose standout Senior Bowl performance garnered mass recognition, and that won\u2019t change. \n \nThere were several standout performers at this year\u2019s Senior Bowl and a few of them just may interest the Eagles in the draft. \n Next:  No. 1   Zay Jones, WR, East Carolina  \nYou know you\u2019ve had yourself a good day when Jerry Rice singles you out on social media . \n \nJones, a senior wideout out of East Carolina, is quickly gaining recognition after totally dominating all week in Mobile, Alabama. Jones tallied six receptions for 68 yards and a touchdown in the Senior Bowl and should have had two more touchdowns, but both of which were called back. \n \nHere\u2019s the play that stole the show: \n \nCBS Sports projects Jones will be a third-round selection. But after this impressive performance, it\u2019s hard to imagine he\u2019ll be unclaimed by the end of the second round. \n Next:  No. 2   Lorenzo Jerome, DB, Saint Francis  \nYou\u2019ve probably never heard of Lorenzo Jerome. But if you watched any of the Senior Bowl, you certainly know who he is now. \n \nThe 6\u20190\u2033, 195-pound defensive back had the performance of his life Saturday, forcing a fumble and recording a pair of interceptions. Granted, both of his interceptions were gifts from the opposing quarterback, but a pick is a pick. At the end of the day, Jerome put himself on a lot of team\u2019s radar, and that\u2019s what the Senior Bowl is all about. \n \nJerome is currently projected to go between the fourth and fifth round, but his Senior Bowl performance could raise his stock a tad despite coming from a smaller school. \n Next:  No. 3   Kareem Hunt, RB, Toledo  \nHunt carried the ball 15 times for 118 yards and was named North Outstanding Player Honors. On his longest run of the day, a 43-yard scamper down the left sideline, Hunt showed what made him such an exciting player in college\u2014excellent vision, balance and the refusal to be taken down on initial contact. \n \nWe have the Eagles taking Hunt in the fourth round in our first Eagles only mock draft of the offseason. As a senior at Toledo, Hunt finished the season rushing for 1,475 yards and 10 touchdowns with an average of 5.6 yards per carry. He also tallied 41 receptions for 403 yards and another score. \n Next:  No. 4   Tanoh Kpassagnon, DE, Villanova  \nKpassagnon (pronounced Tawn-oh pass-N-yo) is a skyscraper with arms and legs. The 6\u20197\u2033, 280-pound defensive end recorded a sack in Saturday\u2019s Senior Bowl and caught the eye of just about every team in the NFL thanks to his sheer size and strength. \n \nAs a senior at Villanova, Kpassagnon finally finished growing into his body and recorded 45 tackles, 21.5 tackles for loss and 11 sacks. The towering edge defender is currently projected to be selected between the third and fourth round of the draft. \n \nOn top of dominating on the gridiron, Kpassagnon was a double major at Villanova. With Villanova being located in the suburbs of northwestern Philadelphia, it\u2019s hard to imagine the Eagles haven\u2019t already done their fair share of homework on this physically imposing defender. \n Next:  No. 5   Josh Reynolds, WR, Texas A&M  \nReynolds didn\u2019t make the highlight reel catches that Zay Jones made, but he finished off the afternoon recording six receptions for 96 yards and a score. Following his lone touchdown of the day, the 6\u20193\u2033 Reynolds used his height to make an over-the-shoulder catch on a fade route for a two-point conversion attempt, but was unable to get both feet down inbounds. \n \nIn three years with the Aggies, Reynolds caught 164 balls for 2,788 yards and 30 touchdowns. Reynolds is tall and has solid overall speed, but has a very small torso and is easy to knock around. With some added weight, Reynolds could become a formidable No. 2 receiver in the pros. \n  More from Inside the Iggles   \nThis article originally appeared on","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ryan Quigley/FanSided via Inside the Iggles Fansided"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - Philadelphia Eagles news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"5 draft prospects who impressed in 2017 Senior Bowl","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"FOXSports.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659359","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"FOXSports.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["AmericanFootball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.foxsports.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://musketfire.com/","http://bloggingdirty.com/","http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WentCa00.htm?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-","http://insidetheiggles.com/","http://thelandryhat.com/","http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/P/PresDa01.htm?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-","http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/5-draft-prospects-who-impressed-in-2017-senior-bowl-012917#","https://twitter.com/JerryRice/status/825438813635751936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw","http://insidetheiggles.com/2017/01/25/philadelphia-eagles-mock-draft/"],"sequenceId":"695203237153","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Every step brings the pilgrims closer to God.\n\nAs they walk they perform numerous rituals, including carrying stones on their heads. It is believed that they are registering their names at the mountain.\n\nBy doing so their names are recorded in heaven.\n\nNazareth church youth chairperson Sphiwe Nzuza, said the mountain service is one of the most important occasions in the church calender and every church member is expected to visit the \u2018holy land\u2019.\n\nThe church\u2019s founder, Inkosi Isaiah Shembe, is said to have received the Holy Spirit at Nhlangakazi mountain nearby in Ndwedwe, however the fifth leader of the church, Mduduzi \u201cNyanzilwezulu\u201d Shembe, changed the location to Canaan mountain.\n\nA faction of this church still returns to the Nhlangakazi mountain. At its peak the church claimed more than a million members, though this seems to have been diluted by breakaways over the years.\n\nPreacher Jabulisa Ngubane from the Etete temple described Shembe as an African prophet who was sent by God to Africa.\n\nShembe came to tell the people to praise the Lord, but without abandoning their traditions and culture.\n\n\u201cThat is why we wear our traditional clothing and do the traditional dances to praise God,\u201d said Ngubane.\n\nThe white stones around their temples which are commonly seen around the North Coast, symbolize the presence of God \u2013 it is holy ground and you are required to remove your shoes before you enter. There is no altar, no stained glass windows, but it is as much a place of worship as any other.\n\nThe purpose of the pilgrimage is to receive blessings, hear sermons and strengthen their faith. Nzuza said Shembe walks with them and along the journey he allows them to take an hour break every day.\n\n\u201cWe do get tired but we were all excited about reaching the top and receive blessings from God. Should someone feel tired and decided to jump into a car, that is also not a problem. However we try to walk all the way,\u201d said Nzuza.\n\nThe men lead the walk and it takes about three hours for them to enter through the gate at the foot of the mountain before women are permitted to enter, due to the sheer number of Shembe followers.\n\nEveryone is allowed to walk, including children from 13 years of age. When they arrive, the pilgrims camp in tents or build small shacks called amadokodo.\n\n\u201cWe arrived at the mountain around 10am and only got a chance to build my idokodo around 10pm. Even at that time there were people arriving,\u201d said Nzuza.\n\nThe huge number of Shembe, all dressed in white, cover the mountain as far as the eye can see and make a spectacular sight.\n\nDuring the pilgrimage no one is allowed to eat fermented food, including bread. Hawkers start up impromptu businesses to provide for the needs of the masses.\n\nOzwathini children take advantage of the festivities and sell wild flowers on the side of the road.\n\nThe presenter of the \u2018Vuthelani icilongo show\u2019 on Durban local radio station, Izwi LoMzansi, Sizwe Majola, said the flowers have a similar meaning to the stones.\n\n\u201cWe leave the flowers at the entrance, midpoint and when we exit the mountain.

The motion picture academy calls \u201cextremely troubling,\u201d the possible visa ban of Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, whose feature film The Salesman is nominated for a best foreign-language Oscar. In a statement released Saturday, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences expressed concern that Farhadi and his cast and crew may not be permitted to attend next month\u2019s Oscar ceremony in Los Angeles following President Trump\u2019s plan to temporarily suspend issuing visas for people from Iran and six other Muslim countries.\n\nFarhadi has not commented on his travel plans, but on Friday, the president of the National Iranian American Council, Trita Parsi, tweeted: \u201cConfirmed: Iran\u2019s Asghar Farhadi won\u2019t be let into the US to attend Oscar\u2019s.\u201d On Thursday, Iranian actress Taraneh Alidoosti, star of The Salesman, tweeted she would boycott the Oscars whether allowed to attend or not in protest of Trump\u2019s immigration policies, which she called \u201cracist\u201d. In its statement Saturday, the academy said, \u201cAs supporters of filmmakers and the human rights of all people around the globe, we find it extremely troubling that Asghar Farhadi, the director of the Oscar-winning film from Iran A Separation, along with the cast and crew of this year\u2019s Oscar-nominated film The Salesman, could be barred from entering the country because of their religion or country of origin.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, La La Land leads the nominations by getting 14 nods from the Academy this year followed by Arrival ( 8) and Moonlight (8). Dev Patel has got a nomination for Best Supporting actor for his performance in film Lion. As expected, both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have secured nominations in Best Actor and Best Actress categories. Meryl Streep has got a nomination for her performance in Florence Foster Jenkins.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Film academy troubled by possible visa ban of Oscar-nominated director Asghar Farhadi","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Indian Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660698","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"Indian Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695203237853","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:19:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/asghar-farhadi-480.jpg?w=450"},{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/asghar-farhadi-480.jpg?w=480"}],"video":[]}}

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\u201cMr. President, look at us,\u201d said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \u201cThis is America. What you have done is shameful. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \u201cWe are all immigrants!\u201d and \u201cNo ban! No wall!\u201d \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\u201d \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n \n\u201cThis executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \u201cPortland coffee comes from Yemen,\u201d one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n \nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \u201chashtag activist\u201d but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n \n\u201cThis was the last straw,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cWe\u2019re all immigrants.\u201d \n \nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n \nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey. \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"More protests against Trump\u2019s immigration policies planned","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"I973hits.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"498055530","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"I973hits.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.i973hits.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/us-immigration-protests/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695203238154","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:20:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}
