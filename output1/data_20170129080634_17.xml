<TEXT>
Family Dog 2 
  
Every family who <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE">chooses</EVENT> which kind of dog breed for their family must <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE">keep</EVENT> this in mind. Every dog is loyal to their master and the dogs attitude is <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE">developed</EVENT> by how the master had <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE">treated</EVENT> them. It is also important to <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE">consider</EVENT> the dogs activeness and physical activity needs. 
 
Here are the 5 best dog breeds for families: 
 
1.) Bulldog 
 
Other than the aggressive bulldogs face, this dog breed very less aggression. They are not very energetic and does not <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE">react</EVENT> negatively on situations. Considering the traits of this dog breed, this is very ideal for families.

2.) Beagle 
 
Beagles are energetic and friendly. This is ideal for families with children who <EVENT eid="e7" class="I_STATE">loves</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE">play</EVENT> a lot in their backyards. The dog is a bit of high maintenance when it comes to brushing and bathing but is worth spending some money for how they interact with people.

3.) Bull Terrier 
 
Bull terriers are intelligent, energetic and friendly dogs that can take a lot of <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE">roughhousing</EVENT> while remaining calm. Particularly <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE">suited</EVENT> to large families, they <EVENT eid="e11" class="I_ACTION">dont complain</EVENT> too much when <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE">manhandled</EVENT> by children, and can actually help <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE">teach</EVENT> kids how to properly <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE">relate</EVENT> to dogs.

4.) Collie 
 
Collies <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE">love</EVENT> nothing more than to <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE">make</EVENT> their humans happy, and its really not a stretch to <EVENT eid="e17" class="I_ACTION">imagine</EVENT> that you could <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE">train</EVENT> a dog in <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE">fetching</EVENT> some things for you. Collie is a bit high maintenance and on it <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE">grooming</EVENT> considering it long coat.
