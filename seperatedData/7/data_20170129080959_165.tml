<TITLE>H.S. WRESTLING: Gould leads North Attleboro to second-place finish at league meet</TITLE>
<TEXT>
EASTON - Senior captain Nick Gould won his weight class competition and the North Attleboro High wrestling team excelled across the board as the Rocketeers placed a close second behind meet champion Franklin High at the Hockomock League Tournament at Oliver Ames High School Saturday.

North Attleboro collected 212.5 points, just behind Franklin's 218.5 points for a strong showing on the mate at the 11-team tourney.

"We have some really great kids in this town," said North Attleboro coach Wayne Griffin. "We did a lot of things right today. If we could change a couple of things that happened, of course we would, but we are moving in the right direction."

Gould placed first at 152 pounds, going 4-0 with three pins along the way. Meanwhile, North Attleboro had three second-place finishers in juniors Danny Cooper (113) and Jake Direnzo (120), and senior Brandon Graveline (132). Ryan Clemente had three pins en route to his 285-pound third place finish. The Rocketeers also had several fourth-place finishers in Brad White (220), Adam Eberle (160), Brady Folan (106), Zack Gould (138) and Reid Wills (170) to help boost their point total.

"All the kids that fought through the consolation rounds helps generate points," said Griffin. "I'm really proud of our kids, we're going to continue to march on."

Foxboro's Matt Kelley (132), Brian Kelley (138) and Matt Mullally (160) each won the championship in their respective weight classes, going a perfect 3-0 along the way. The three champions helped the Warriors to place third (200.5 points) behind only Franklin and North Attleboro at the tournament.

Max Dorman took second at 152 pounds with Adam Lancot third at 106.

King Philip had a pair of champions in 220-pounder Brad Oliverio and 182-pounder Nick Gould. Cameron Smith (160) added a second-place finish. Joe Frucci (145) and Luke Fitch (152) were able to battle through the consolation rounds in order to capture third-place showings. The Warriors placed fifth, totalling 119 team points.Antonios Sevantos (106) and Vinnie Holmes (170) each captured Hockomock titles for Manfield High, who finished the tournament in eighth place (107 points).

The Norton Lancers won their 17th meet in their last 18 outings after sweeping Watertown, Quincy and Scituate in a quadrangular meet Saturday. In improving to 21-5 overall, the Lancers had three wins from Arthur O'Neill (285), Patrick Feeney (182), Kyle Pereira (170), Jack Czyrklis (152), Brett Santangelo (138), Brendan Merriott (132) and Alex Turcotte (106).

Andy Murphy (113) and Justin Lunn (145) both scored two pins for the Lancers (21-5), who host Ashland for the Tri-Valley League dual meet championship on Wednesday.

"We're peaking at the right time," said Norton coach Patrick Coleman as the Lancers upstaged 17-win Watertown and seek to upend Ashland, which finished ahead of the Lancers at the Oliver Ames Tournament. Then it's on to the MIAA Division 3 Dual Meet Tournament Saturday in Wayland.

At the MIAA Vocational Schools Meet, the Cougars of Tri-County took eighth place. Cole Guertin (113) took three wins with two pins, Kevin Carlucci (126) t ook four wins with two pins and Phil Hulbig (160) took three wins with two pins.
