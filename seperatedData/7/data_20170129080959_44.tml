<TITLE>JUSTICE STORY SHORT MAYOR, BIG VOICE: NYC Mayor LaGuardia blasted Hitler, Nazis when most U.S. pols stayed silent</TITLE>
<TEXT>
A top-coated man with a tightly clenched right fist stalked Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia up the steps of City Hall as he returned from an outing late one morning just before Christmas in 1938. 
 
When Capt. James Harten, the mayors bodyguard, jogged ahead to open the door, the stranger lurched forward, tapped LaGuardias shoulder and unleashed a roundhouse right when the Little Flower pivoted. 
 
The punch caught the 5-foot-2 LaGuardia just below the left eye. His fedora took flight, and he landed on his can. The mayor scrambled upright and throttled his cursing assailant as cops pulled the man down, bloodying his mouth. 
 
The slugger proved to be James Hagan, 48, a Bronx stonemason who had worked as a WPA superintendent before going off the rails months before the Dec. 20 assault. 
 
He was carried into City Hall and plopped into a chair. 
 
Whyd you slug me, the mayor asked the stranger.

You know why, Hagan replied. Ive been waiting to give you this for four years. You pulled the badger on me. 
 
The delusional Hagan was hustled off to Bellevue Hospital as LaGuardia shrugged off a black eye and angry red welt. 
 
All in a days work, the mayor said. It was nothing compared to some blows delivered under the belt. 
 
LaGuardia certainly had plenty of enemies  Germany, for example. 
 
Two weeks before the kooky assault, a letter for the mayor  postmarked Long Island City  arrived at City Hall. It included a .22-caliber cartridge and a threat: You will get this if you continue to attack the German Nazi Party. It was signed with a swastika.

LaGuardia, mayor from 1934 to 1945, is remembered for many things, from steering New York out of the Depression to his comic readings of the Sunday funny pages during a newspaper strike. 
 
But he played another role whose gravity has been largely forgotten: With Congress and President Franklin Roosevelt gagged by their own look-away policies, LaGuardia was the rare American politician willing to call Adolf Hitler the fascist that he was. 
 
And it drove the uber-Nazi nuts. 
 
LaGuardias mother, Irene Coen, was born into a prestigious Jewish family in Croatia near Trieste, Italy. The mayor became Germanys proxy punching bag for American Jews. And LaGuardia counterpunched the Fuhrer with the sting of Joe Louis. 
 
When Germany demanded more protection at its New York Consulate, for example, LaGuardia assigned an all-Jewish special police detail, led by Capt. Max Finkelstein, president of the Shomrin Society, the NYPD society of Jewish cops.

LaGuardia steamed the Nazis by suggesting the 1939 New York Worlds Fair ought to include a chamber of horrors featuring a certain brown-shirted fanatic. 
 
The depth of federal denial of reality became clear when U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull conceded to Germanys demand for an official apology, saying LaGuardia did not represent the attitude of this government toward the German government. 
 
LaGuardia doubled down: I still stand by what I said and repeat it again. He relentlessly poked the Fuhrer, calling the oberschwein stupid, childish and paranoid. 
 
Josef Goebbels propaganda machine took dead aim at the mayor. 
 
Goebbels once said, Think of the press as a great keyboard on which the government can play. And so he did.

HAGAN) (WATCH - WATCH - WATCH - WATCH - WATCH) (PHOTO BY QUINTIERI - COURTESY OF IL PROGRESSO)  UNITED STATES - December 21: New York Daily News front page Wednesday, December 21, 1938, TRAP COSTER'S ARMS DEALER  (New York Daily News Archive/NY Daily News via )   
The Daily News' coverage of LaGuardia's violent encounter with Hagan. 
  
Der Angriff (The Attack), Goebbels fact-free voice box, demanded that the half-Jew mayor of the the world metropolis of Jewry be locked up. It called him a Jewish bug and a cheap Jewish apostle with his cheap Jewish brain. 
 
Once and for all we want it understood that we will not tolerate insults to the Fuhrer, the paper whined. We Germans demand that in dealing with us courtesy be employed, to which we have been accustomed for 2,000 years. 
 
The German-American Conference of Greater New York chimed in, declaring without irony that LaGuardias remarks about the obvious German persecution of religious and racial minorities breeds race hatred and ill-feeling among our citizens of different racial extractions. 
 
The Nazi press cheered when LaGuardia got slugged at City Hall. Der Angriff growled that it showed how well the half-Jew is liked by his closest fellow-citizens. 
 
LaGuardia got his black eye 41 days after Kristallnacht, when 1,000 Jews were killed and 30,000 were arrested in 24 hours. Soon after getting his shiner, LaGuardia threw another jab while accepting a check to help resettle Jewish refugees. Conditions in Germany are the shame and horror of civilization, he declared.

Hagan, the slugger, proved to be Irish, not German. He was charged with assault and was due in court 10 days later. But he was diagnosed with delusions of persecution, and LaGuardia graciously waved criminal charges. 
 
He is a very sick boy, and I feel very sorry for him, the mayor said. 
 
Hagan was transferred to a Long Island hospital for long-term treatment and slipped out of the public eye. 
 
His larger enemy did not. 
 
LaGuardias fight with Hitler grew more personal when the family of his sister, Gemma LaGuardia Gluck, who had married a Hungarian Jew, was confined to concentration camps after the 1944 Nazi invasion of Budapest. By then, the rest of America had come around to LaGuardias point of view. 
 
Gemma Gluck survived, but her husband and son-in-law perished. 
 
She later said she had demanded an explanation during her arrest. A brown shirt replied, It is enough that you are LaGuardias sister.
