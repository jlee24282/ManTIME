<TITLE>'Great Rebuilding' of US Armed Forces Reflects 'Distrust in NATO'</TITLE>
<TEXT>
On Friday, President Trump made his first visit tothe Pentagon sincehis inauguration onJanuary 20. There he announced his intention launch what he called a "great rebuilding" ofthe US Armed Forces. 
"I'm signing an executive action tobegin a great rebuilding ofthe armed services ofthe United States," the president said ina brief ceremony that included the swearing inof the new defense secretary, James Mattis. 
 
"We're developing a plan fornew planes, new ships, new resources, and new tools forour men and women inuniform," Trump added, though he did not provide additional details. 
 
The US leader said the order was signed to ensure the sacrifices ofour military are supported bythe actions ofour government. 
 
The document also orders new Defense Secretary James Mattis toconduct a 30-day review ofthe readiness ofthe armed forces toassess their ability toconduct the fight againstthe Islamic State (ISIS, Daesh) and other forms ofradical Islamic terrorism alongwith training, equipment maintenance, munitions, modernization and infrastructure. 
 
This 30-day review is aimed atallowing the defense secretary and the president toestablish the facts and determine the necessary priorities forthe rebuilding ofthe military. 
According toThe Washington Post, which says it has obtained a draft ofthe order onThursday, it also says it would examine how tocarry outoperations againstunnamed near-peer competitors, a term that US officials ":typically use tomean China and Russia, butthat language is not inthe final version." 
Within 60 days, Mattis also must submit toTrump a plan toimprove overall readiness inthe military byfiscal 2019. It will focus oneverything frommaintenance backlogs tothe availability oftraining ranges and manpower shortages, and the time needed tocoordinate and carry outmilitary training. 
 
The order also calls fora review to reduce commitments not directly related tothe highest priority operations tomake resources available fortraining and maintenance. 
 
Trump also called forreviews ofthe US militarys nuclear arsenal and ofballistic missile defense, two critical defense areas which have both suffered considerably underthe Obama administration. 
 
Commenting onthe signed document, Russian military expert and First Vice President ofthe Academy ofGeopolitical Studies Konstantin Sivkov told Sputnik that it underscores "distrust inNATO," and the alliance's capability ofensuring the security ofAmerica. 
 
"The measures forthe build-up ofpower ofthe US armed forces have the only explanation: Trump does not trust NATO and considers it an obsolete organization. And if so, he should solve the US national security issues only atthe expense ofthe US bybuilding-up ofstrength and size ofhis own army, and that is what he is doing," the expert told Sputnik. 
 
Konstantin Sivkov also noted that this order is addressed, first and foremost, tothe US establishment, which still regards Trump as "a dark horse" president, whose aims and ambitions still remain unclear. 
"By addressing the Pentagon, he has made these aims clear," he said. 
However he further noted that Moscow should also make certain conclusions fromthe abovestatements ofthe US, leader, who, unlikehis predecessor Obama, seems topursue more decisive style offoreign policy. 
 
"In the first days ofhis presidency, Trump has done more that Obama inthe whole year, thus we should expect fast and very unexpected decisions fromhim," the expert said. 
 
"Thus we should make certain conclusions and build-up our defensive potential. As, regardless ofwhatever is said aboutTrump, due toits geographic position, mentality and a number ofother factors, the US remains an antagonist ofRussia," Sivkov said. 
 
However atthe same time he suggested that the announced rebuilding ofthe US Armed Forces does not mean the refusal ofa compromise betweenWashington and Moscow, including the joint cooperation inthe fight againstinternational terrorism. 
 
"There certainly will be a compromise betweenthe two countries, because forTrump, it is not Moscow butinternational terrorism which currently remains the main enemy. And I think that the US president will master support ofPresident Putin inthe fight againstit," the expert finally stated. 
In a separate comment onthe same issue, Russian apolitical and military analyst Alexander Perendzhiev, an associate professor inthe Faculty ofPolitical Sciences and Sociology atthe Plekhanov Russian University ofEconomics, suggested that Donald Trump has ordered toreview the US militarys nuclear arsenal and ofballistic missile defense tobe able tofurther strengthen the US strategic and conventional armed forces. 
Thus, he said, the US president is delivering onhis electoral promises toinspect the efficiency offinancing ofthe US Armed Forces and re-equip it withnew equipment. 
 
"Trump is laying emphasis onthe strategic forces. He is going tostrengthen them. And his decisions apparently should prompt Russia's military-political leadership towardspreventive strengthening ofRussia's potential," he told Sputnik. 
 
The expert further specified what he meant: incase the US modernizes it national anti-missile defense, Russia, inturn, should modernize its strategic missiles tobe able tooverpower the prospective US' anti-missile defense.
