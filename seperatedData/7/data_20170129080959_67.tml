Powerful drama Manchester By The Sea leads the way with four nominations, while musical La La Land  which earned a record equalling 14 Oscar nods  is up for two awards. 
 
Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown could make history by becoming the youngest ever SAG Award winner after she was nominated for best actress in a TV drama.
