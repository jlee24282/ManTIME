Moroccos Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) dismantled an ISIS -Affiliated cell that was planning to carry out a dangerous attack in the city of E-Jadida. The Emir of the so-called Moroccan branch of ISIS was arrested on Friday by agents of the BCIJ in El-Jadida. 
 

The individual arrested is being identified as a man named Yassine. During the search of his hideout, a video recording lauding the glorification of martyrdom, as well as other evidence recovered at the scene, confirmed he was planning a major attack in the city. 
 
The four-minute video of Yassine, who has proclaimed himself as the Emir of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, Caliph of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, shows photos of him in different war-like postures. 
 
According to French-language news source, Le360, these photos are part of the propaganda used by ISIS communicators in numerous videos. 
 
The same source adds that the video ends with a sentence that reads do not wait, I will not come back. At the same time this sentence appears, a song glorifying martyrdom and commonly used in ISIS promotional videos, is heard in the background.
