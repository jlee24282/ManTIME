Tyreke Evans hit a 3-pointer from the right wing and a twisting reverse layup in a 7-0 New Orleans run to start the fourth quarter, putting the Pelicans up 92-84.

San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich then emptied his bench. 

The Pelicans trailed 66-55 early in the third quarter, but they closed the period with a 30-18 run to take an 85-84 lead into the final period. New Orleans shot 15 of 23 from the floor in the 37-27 quarter. 

The Spurs used a 37-25 second quarter to take a 57-48 halftime lead. Leonard missed his first three shots of the game and was scoreless in the first quarter, but he scored 14 points in the second period, including all 7 of his free throws to spark San Antonio on offense.

NOTES: New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said he appreciates F Anthony Davis' toughness in playing through a thigh injury. "It's really tough because you get hit in the thigh, and any time you try to plant and turn and jump, there's pain there," Gentry said. "I love the fact that he's trying to push through it and play. " Asked if it might be better to give Davis a game off, Gentry said: "I'm not a smart guy, but I think we're a little bit better with him out on the court." ... Gentry said he felt badly for Portland G Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum who were left off the Western Conference All-Star team. "If you extended the rosters to 15, it's going to be the 16th and 17th guys that feel like they got (overlooked)," Gentry said. ... Asked if he was surprised that only F Kawhi Leonard made the All-Star team, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said: "I don't think about it much."
