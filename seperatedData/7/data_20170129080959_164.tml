<TITLE>Gernot Rohr says Tyrone Ebuehi will be in Nigerias next match</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Super Eagles manager, Gernot Rohr says ADO Den Haag defender, Tyrone Ebuehi, will be available in Nigerias next match. 
 
Rohr is in Gabon monitoring proceeding at the on-going 2017 African Cup of Nations, AFCON. 
 
He expressed his happiness over the decision of Dutch-Nigerian defender to play for the Super Eagles. 
 
The defender had made a U-turn and decided to pitch his tent with his fatherland instead of his country of birth . 
 
The 20-year-old had earlier turned down the invitation to play for Nigeria in the last match against Algeria , opting to remain with his team, to establish himself . 
 
Rohr said in a chat in Gabon where he is working as a pundit, that he had a promise from Ebuehi that he was now willing to play for Nigeria if called up. 
 
Rohr, who has been searching for credible options in the right full back role of the Super Eagles, believes he can fix the situation with Ebuehi. 
 
He said, I hope that Tyrone Ebuehi will be ready for the next Super Eagles game that we will play. We need a good right back.
