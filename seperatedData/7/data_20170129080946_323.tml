<TITLE>Kehlani: SweetSexySavage review  tunes and attitude</TITLE>
<TEXT>
(Atlantic) Kehlanis career may have begun on Americas Got Talent, but the tattooed, gamine Californian is more intriguing than your average R&B wannabe. If her name has resonated for all the wrong reasons  last years hospitalisation after her love life got complicated  the singers debut album proper proves she has the tunes and personality to back up the notoriety. A generous helping of SSS has been out already, with the video for the nagging Distraction amply fulfilling the "sexy" third of the album title triptych. Tracks like the even-more-nagging CRZY, meanwhile, tout attitude. As well as modern R&B postures, the musicality of Kehlanis vocal melodies hark back to previous eras  Keep On is a particularly sweet bagatelle. Watch the video for Distraction.
