<TITLE>Keep focus on service, not politics</TITLE>
<TEXT>
New Trumbull County Sheriff Paul Monroes former service as Howland police chief was admirable, and now we urge him to continue along a similar path as sheriff. 
 
Monroe began his four-year term as Trumbull County sheriff on Jan. 2 after defeating longtime sheriff Thomas Altiere in the March primary. He was unopposed in November. 
 
Some of the challenges he will face as sheriff  such as budget limitations, serious crime and the growing opioid epidemic  should be nothing new to this longtime leader in the law enforcement field. Now, however, he also will deal with new issues like managing an often-overcrowded county jail and overseeing an operation that is more than three times the size of his previous department. 
 
To further complicate budget matters, the outgoing sheriff had submitted a budget request calling for a $1.4 million increase based on negotiations and anticipated raises among the sheriffs office unions. Monroe said he knows he must perfect a balancing act between managing the needs of his employees along with the expectations of the taxpayers. 
 
These issues would be challenging for any new department head to face, but couple that with the politics of holding an elected position for the first time in your life, and the goal of making a seamless transition and managing a large, critically important department suddenly becomes even more complicated. 
 
Unfortunately, we often see elected officials become swept up more in politics than in the service they were elected to provide. 
 
We have no reason to believe that might be the case here. We realize Monroe has experience in Howland with making and implementing often unpopular decisions. 
 
We know he already has met three times with Trumbull County Auditor Adrian Biviano and two commissioners as they worked to assemble the 2017 general fund spending plan that involved allocations for his new office. Its that type of advanced planning and tenacity that give us high hopes about the future of the sheriffs department. 
 
We also know Monroe ran a strong campaign that included much time knocking on doors, particularly in the rural parts of Trumbull County served by the sheriffs office. He made himself known to the constituents who may not have been very familiar with his service in Howland, and listened to their concerns. 
 
We urge Monroe to keep his focus on fighting crime, providing service and running a tight ship. We remind him not to forget the issues and concerns shared by residents of Trumbull County, and expect that he will keep his focus more on those needs than on the politics that often begin to consume elected office holders. 
 
If he serves well  and we suspect he will  any future political aspirations will follow naturally.
