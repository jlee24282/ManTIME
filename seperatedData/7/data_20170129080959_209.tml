<TITLE>Five amazing places to camp in the UAE and beyond</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Keen to spend a weekend away in the great outdoors? Here are five excellent camping options that are driving distance from Dubai  White Sands Beach  
Perfect for: Beach-loving campers

The lowdown: White Sands Beach isnt an official area, but rather a nickname given to a stretch of coastline in Oman located between Fins and Wadi Shab. We wont lie  its a long drive, but well worth it to pitch your tent on a cliff above an empty sandy beach and fall asleep to the sound of the waves. Plus, the remote nature of the area means you hopefully wont have to share your spot with many other campers. 
 
Things to do in the area: For water babies, its the perfect camping spot. Bring your snorkels and paddleboards for exploring the coastline (keep an eye out for sea urchins near the beach though). Be sure to visit Wadi Shab just a short drive away, where you can hike through the dramatic wadis and cool off by diving into the deep, emerald green pools. 
 
Difficulty rating: 3/5. Medium. Its not a complicated route, but the long drive is not one youd want to take alone. 
 
44 needed? Not essential, but recommended. 
 
Time: Seven hours 
 
Directions from Dubai: Drive towards Muscat but just before you get to the city, get on the new Muscat Expressway. Head in the direction of Sur and follow the coastline until you find a good spot.

 Liwa  
Perfectfor: Desert adventurers and Star Wars fans

The lowdown:  Its been nearly a year since Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens hit our screens, and were still excited at the prospect of visiting one of the filming locations. Liwa is located in the Empty Quarter, or Rub Al Khali, the largest sand desert in the world. We cant guarantee that youll find an abandoned Millennium Falcon, but you will experience incredible (and massive) sand dunes, miles of wilderness and some of the brightest starry nights youll ever see in the UAE. 
 
Things to do in the area: We recommend renting a couple of fat bikes beforehand (you can pick one up from Adventure HQ for Dhs150 per day): theres nothing better than zipping across the dunes on their puffy tyres, especially as the sun is setting. Experienced off-roaders will have a blast doing a bit of dune bashing, but keep in mind that this is not an easy area to get out of if you get into trouble: carry plenty of food and water, and dont travel in convoys of less than three 4x4s, just in case someone needs towing. 
 
Difficulty rating:  4/5. Medium to hard. Its relatively simple to find, but youll need some off-roading skills if you want to head off the beaten path and into the dunes. Its not one for beginners  we recommend travelling with an experienced group. 
 
44 needed?  Essential 
 
Time:  Four hours 
 
Directions from Dubai:  Drive from Dubai to Abu Dhabi, take the E11, turn on to E65 to Emirates National Auto Museum. Keep following the E65 until you see the sign to Qasr Al Sarab. Ignore it  follow the road right instead. 
 Al Qudra Lakes  
Perfect for: Beginners 
 

 
The lowdown:  Al Qudra Lakes is the ideal location if youre new to camping in the UAE, or just looking for a low-key break from the city that wont require a huge amount of effort. You wont need a 44 to reach these picturesque lakes, and the area is within half an hours drive of the city. Keep in mind that because its so easily accessible, its popular with  weekend warriors. 
 
Things to do in the area: Al Qudra Lakes might be manmade but its still a picturesque slice of greenery, with plenty of trees and wildlife, especially birds, to be spotted in and around the water. If youre feeling sporty you could also go for a bike around the nearby Al Qudra Cycle Track, where you might also spot wild oryx and gazelle (rent a bike from the Trek store). If the great outdoors get too much for you, theres always Bab Al Shams Resort And Spa nearby for a little R&R. Its unlikely youll need it though, as there are plenty of amenities in the area. 
 
Difficulty rating: 1/5. An easy to reach spot with minimal off-roading. 
 
44 needed?  No 
 
Time: Half an hour 
 
Directions from Dubai: Take Hessa Street to the start of Al Qudra Cycle Track, turn left, turn right and take the off-road track. Follow it until you find a good spot. 
 Fossil Rock, Sharjah  
Perfect for: Day trippers and desert newbies 
 

 
The lowdown:  Fossil Rock is one of the most popular hangout spots for Dubais weekend warriors, from dune bashers and dune buggy riders to trail runners. The surrounding dunes are the perfect location to set up camp, especially for large groups who dont mind a bit of noise and excitement. Its also close enough to civilisation that newbies can feel comfortable knowing their home comforts are not too far away. 
 
Things to see and do: This is one of the best places in the UAE for a spot of dune bashing, but we recommend it for experienced off-roaders only. The Camel Rock nearby is also worth a visit, as is Big Red, a huge red dune thats popular with dune buggying daredevils. 
 
Difficulty rating: 2/5. E asy to medium  its simple to get to, but requires some off-roading skills. 
 
44 needed?  Essential for navigating the sand dunes. 
 
Time:  One hour 
 
Directions from Dubai:  Take the 611 towards Sharjah. Turn right onto the Sharjah-Kalba Road, then turn right again at the big junction surrounded by pylons. 
 Jebel Shams, Oman  
Perfect for: Outdoor explorers 
 
Photo: Pete Maloney 
  
The lowdown:  If youve never been to Oman before you need to add Jebel Shams to your bucket list. Also known as the Grand Canyon Of Oman, the scenery here is breathtaking  rugged mountains, towering cliffs and the canyon itself. Theres an official campsite near the start of the hike, but bear in mind that temperatures are likely to be lower than youre used to in Dubai. 
 
Things to do: The main attraction of Jebel Shams is the balcony walk inside the canyon itself. Despite the awe-inspiring scenery, the single-track hike itself is actually very easy and relatively flat. Out and back takes about an hour  theres an old, historic mud village at the end of the track where you can take a break to have a bite. We also recommend a drive to nearby Misfat Al Abriyeen, an old traditional village thats home to stunning architecture and a lush date plantation. 
 
Difficulty ratin g: 3/5.  Medium. Its a popular tourist site, but the drive is long. 
 
44 needed?  Not essential, but highly recommended to navigate some of the hills. 
 
Time:  Five hours 
 
Directions from Dubai:  Drive to Al Ain and through the border. Dont forget your passport. Head south towards Nizwa and drive through Ibri and Bala.
