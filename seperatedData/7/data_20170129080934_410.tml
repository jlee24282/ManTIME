<TITLE>Local Roundup: Nothing free for Tigers in tough loss at USF</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The Pacific women's basketball team's problem at the free throw line is simple. 
 
It just isn't getting many chances. 
 
Pacific went to the line just three times a low in program history and made just one in a 67-64 loss to USF on Saturday at the Sobrato Center in San Francisco. It was the fourth loss in a row for the Tigers (8-13, 4-6 West Coast Conference) and sixth in seven contests. 
 
Pacific had set a school record for fewest free throw attempts in a game with five in a 69-58 loss to Pepperdine on Jan. 12. While the Tigers had trouble getting to the line again, the Dons (12-9, 6-4) went 17-of-19 from the penalty stripe. 
 
The Tigers did play well early and had a 23-19 lead after the first period. Ameela Li hit a 3-pointer to pull Pacific within a point, 65-64, with 2:01 left in the game, but Nia Alexander of USF hit two free throws with 16 seconds remaining. 
 
Emily Simmons led Pacific with 14 points, Chelsea Lidy had 11 points and GeAnna Luaulu-Summers had 10 points. Rachel Howard had 28 points for the Dons.

Griffins 2, Heat 1 
 
At Grand Rapids, Michigan, Austin Carroll scored for Stockton in the third period, breaking a streak of 204 minutes, 12 seconds without a goal. 
 
It was important for us for sure. Good on Austin for burying it, Heat head coach Ryan Huska said. 
 
Stockton was trailing 1-0 when Carroll tied it 3:35 into the final period. Ben Street scored the game winner with 2:51 to go. Goalie Jon Gillies had 37 saves for the Heat (19-16-4), which has lost four in a row and seven of eight.
