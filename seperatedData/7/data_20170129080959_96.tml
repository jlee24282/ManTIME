<TITLE>Escape into a New Realm</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Viktor, a renowned thief, is strong-armed along with his friends into liberating a peculiar prisoner from the Sea Brig, Cortasts most notorious prison. Matters take a turn for the worse when a group of black-clad men attack the prison and start slaughtering everyone they encounter. 

Meanwhile, Rantal, an ewien, is released from the secluded room where he has lived his entire life. But the world outside is far more complicated and riddled with intrigue than he could have imagined as he attempts to flee the Empire.
