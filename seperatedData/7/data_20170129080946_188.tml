<TITLE>Deputies shoot man as they look for suspect in fatal Sammamish car prowl</TITLE>
<TEXT>
King County sheriffs deputies shot and wounded a man Friday night as they looked for a suspect in a deadly car prowl earlier in the week at a Sammamish park. 
 
Deputies went to an apartment in the 21600 block of 29th Avenue South in Des Moines where they believed the suspect was staying, the sheriffs office said in a news release. Deputies were outside when a man and a 16-year-old boy walked out around 10:30 p.m. Friday. 
 
The man and the teen pulled out handguns when they saw the deputies, and three deputies opened fire, striking the man, the sheriffs office said. The teen fled and dropped his handgun, the sheriffs office said. 
 
After a search, deputies determined the teen was inside a nearby apartment. The teen was finally convinced to walk out of the apartment and was arrested just after 5a.m. Saturday. 
 
The wounded man was in critical condition Saturday at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. 
 
Detectives have not said how or whether the 16-year-old from Kent was involved in the car prowl. 
 
The deputies involved in the shooting  all three are veteran officers  will be placed on paid administrative leave. 
 
The man killed Wednesday at Beaver Lake Park in Sammamish was the son of a Seattle police officer. Authorities said Moises Elias Radcliffe, 22, was walking his dog with his girlfriend at the park when he saw someone who tried to break into his parked vehicle around 2:30 p.m. 
 
According to the King County Sheriffs Office, Radcliffe ran and confronted the person. The prowler then jumped into a tan or gold SUV  not Radcliffes vehicle  and drove toward Radcliffe, who opened fire at the vehicle, authorities said. The SUV struck and killed Radcliffe, and the driver took off. 
  
Correction: 
 
Information in this article, originally published Saturday, Jan. 28, 2017, was corrected later that day. A previous version of this story, and the headline accompanying it, incorrectly stated that the man wounded in the police shooting Friday was a suspect in the deadly car prowl. Authorities said later Saturday that he was not.
