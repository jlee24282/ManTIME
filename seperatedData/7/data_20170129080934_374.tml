<TITLE>'Really, Really Smart'</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Boys and girls were told the following story. Then they were shown photos of two men and two women, and asked to guess which person the story was about. By age 6, girls were less likely than boys to favor their own gender. 

"There are lots of people at the place where I work. But there is one person who is really special. This person is really, really smart. This person figures out how to do things quickly and comes up with answers much faster and better than anyone else. This person is really, really smart."
