A SCUNTHORPE woman has said she's got more energy and confidence after a superhuman weight loss achievement. 
 
After originally popping along to a Weight Watchers session in support of her friend, Lisa Kennington, 34, of Ashby, wasn't even looking for weight loss advice or expecting any success herself when she attended the group 10 months ago. 
 
In that time, Lisa has lost an amazing six stones after originally weighing 17 stones.

"I am proud of myself," she said. 
 
"It's really motivating to carry on when you lose weight and you look and feel better. 
 
"When I was overweight I didn't realise the impact it was having, I have lots more energy, I'm able to do more and I have more confidence in myself. 
 
"I have been exercising  I've joined a gym which is something I never thought I would do." 
 
After her weight loss: 
 

 
She added that her friends and family have also been bowled over by her transformation. 
 
"They just say how different I look," she said. 
 
"And they say how I have changed in myself." 
 
She added that she had also been suffering with back problems for years, which she potentially needed surgery for and which weren't being helped by her weight  but as a result of her achievement, the operation is now not necessary. 
 
After struggling with her weight her whole life and getting demoralised by failed diets, Lisa said that Weight Watchers helps to make healthy eating and exercise more of an achievable lifestyle choice. 
 
She said: "Everyone in the groups supports each other and the plan I have been following is easy. It's quite amazing how quickly the weight has gone. 
 
"When you're dieting on your own it's easier to not diet. 
 
Scunthorpe woman falsely claimed thousands in benefits to 'make sure the family income was stable' 

 
"I have got to my goal and now the aim is to maintain my weight. I am feeling confident because I am still going to the group. 

 
"I think with people working it is easy to slip into bad habits and eat convenience food, now I cook from fresh. 
 
"It is just about making small changes, but you're still allowed to give yourself treats if you really fancy something. It's about learning moderation."
