<TEXT>
Describe your art in a Tweet 

I write to to dissect the human condition with less formaldehyde than middle school biology applied to the frog. 
 
What was your worst show as a performer, and what made it so terrible? 

My worst show was my first feature for The Poets' Asylum ... I wasn't slamming yet and the venue was pretty loud with ambient noise ... I was nervous and quiet ... after the show an older woman came up to tell me that while my poems were alright, she preferred a dynamic reader. 

Whats song or poem are you most addicted to right now? 

I'm currently addicted to My Bubba, especially the song "Island." 
 
Whats Next For You? 

I'm working on a collection of pieces that examine the role of the gender in fairy tales, in particular the role of the bitch/witch/evil woman trope and the characteristics that are or are not presented as positive or negative traits relative to the feminine or masculine presentation of the character. 

I'll also be hosting the slam to decide who will represent Worcester at the2017 Women of the World Poetry Slam Finals in Dallas. The slam will be held at 7:30 p.m. Jan. 31 at The Raven Music Hall in Worcester.
