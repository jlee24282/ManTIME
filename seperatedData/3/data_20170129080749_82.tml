Vincent Enyeama conceded his 27th Ligue 1 goal of the season from the penalty spot in Lille's 2-1 win over Lyon at the Stade des Lumieres on Saturday, reports Completesportsnigeria.com. 
 
The 34 year old shot stopper made a stunning save from a Rafael's header in the 50th minute which kept Lille in the lead, but could not stop Alexandre Lacazette from scoring his 18th of the season from the penalty spot after he had been fouled by Adama Soumaoro with four minute left to play. 
 
The game was Enyeama's 22nd appearance this season and the former Super Eagles captain has kept five clean sheets this term. 
 
In Israel, Anthony Nwakaeme scored his 11th goal of the season for Hapoel Beer Sheva in their 2-0 home win over Hapoel Ironi Kiryat Shmona. 
 
His compatriot John Ogu played the entire duration of the encounter. 
 
In England Alex Iwobi replaced Jeff Reine-Adelaide in the 71st minute of Arsenal's 5-0 thumping of Southampton in Saturday's Emirates FA Cup at the Saint Mary's Stadium. 
 
It was Iwobi's second substitute appearance in the competition. 
 
At Stamford Bridge, Super Eagles forward Victor Moses was an unused substitute for Chelsea who spanked Championship club Brentford 4-0.

The Nigerian midfielder made way in the 74th minute of the defeat for Emre Can as the Reds battled for a replay.
