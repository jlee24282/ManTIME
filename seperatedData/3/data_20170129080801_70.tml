<TITLE>BUBIL: Braves will boost the market</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The West Villages of North Port worked hard to attract the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball spring training operations to the new master-planned community. 
 
Having a major-league baseball team playing 18 games each March, perhaps starting in 2019, will not hurt home sales in the 10,500-acre tract off U.S. 41 a few miles south of Venice that for decades has been known as Taylor Ranch. 
 
But for the West Villages development group, luring the Braves is not just about selling rooftops. 
 
We have not built a business model around this that says, We are going to build 50 more homes by hosting spring training, said Martin Black, general manager of the West Villages, which is being developed with Mattamy Homes of Canada. 
 
There is more to it than that. The Braves will have a year-round presence with a sports rehabilitation and training academy that could bring 70 employees to North Port. 
 
Both in Arizona and Florida, new communities have been built with spring training as a community magnet. But does baseball really help sell houses? West Villages did its market research and held focus groups, asking local residents what they would like to see in a community. 
 
Not just spring training, but a whole host of items, Black said. Part of what has been primary in our discussions as a private developer is the need for this facility to not be just about spring training. It needs to create synergies with the State College of Florida, with the University of Floridas Innovation Station (engineering program) on the state college campus and opportunities for partnering with Sarasota Memorial and its health care complex in West Villages. 
 
So we looked at those synergies as critical, and one of the most significant parts is the Braves bringing their sports rehabilitation and player development activities for their entire network of teams to the West Villages. This is not just about bringing 17 games of baseball in the spring. We want year-round activities that we could leverage to other opportunities. 
 
This will further enhance the regions reputation in a new business segment. 
 
With IMG in the Bradenton market, with the spring training facilities we have (in Bradenton, Sarasota and Port Charlotte), with the rowing facilities at Benderson Park and one the county is doing on the Myakka River on River Road, and now the Braves academy here as well, we have created a corridor around sports tourism and medicine that you dont have anywhere else, Black said. 
 
The Braves also will run fantasy baseball camps for youths and adults at the West Villages facility and host tournament play at all levels, Black said. Outside the 6,500-seat baseball stadium, the $75 million facility will have a plaza and performance venue that can be used for farmers markets and concerts. 
 
Having a blank slate helped the project, which Black envisions as an intergenerational destination focused on an active lifestyle." 
 
One of the reasons we ended up on this site  we have 10,000 acres and looked at a variety of locations  is because it has very little environmental constraints on it. It is a pasture, a hay field with cows grazing on it, Black said. It makes it one of the most efficient and easiest that we could identify from a permitting and design aspect. 
 
The other aspect was, we wanted the facility to be close to the schools and the state college. We saw the opportunity to share uses with the potential high school and state college. 
 
West Villages is donating the land for the facility, with good reason, Black said. 
 
We are building a new town. As part of that, you have houses, you have shopping, you have a downtown, he said. Just as we have provided a site for elementary and middle schools to the school board and working with the Catholic Church on a new site for them in the West Villages, there are opportunities that come with having that public recreation and entertainment venue. 
 
If we didnt get the Braves, would we have been disappointed? Yes. But we would have turned to other things that would have created opportunities for that public engagement, outdoor recreation and entertainment to come with it.
