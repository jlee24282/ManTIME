"No need to wait I know I live this every day I can smell it I see the ambition of the club my teammates the manager I am living it seeing it Wait to sign No No Now is the right time" he said

"I understand what Liverpool means We can say Kenny Dalglish Ian Rush Alan Hansen Graeme Souness Luis Suarez Steven Gerrard Ive been here quite a few years already its not like I am new I understand

"To have signed a new contract at this club my goal is to be thought of one day in the same way as these players They are legends You define the success of a player by his loyalty or his titles Or both In order to be part of this group I have so much to do

"I want to win titles Five years is my new contract  it gives me that opportunity"
