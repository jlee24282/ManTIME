<TITLE>Song to Get You Through the Week: Sean Ryder delivers brooding protest song</TITLE>

Increasingly, its becoming harder and harder to take water for granted. In Flint, Michigan, lead contamination poisoned the drinking water supply. California, the nations largest agricultural producing state, has wrestled with a drought for five years, and weve even dealt with a drought here in Worcester. And then theres Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota, where members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe have led a protest against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which they argue is a threat to their clean water supply, as well as to their ancestral burial grounds. Water, which seemingly runs so freely when you turn the tap, is suddenly among the countrys most heatedly political things. 
 
There have been numerous attempts to capture the conflicts brewing around water in song, but most attempts have landed flatly, clich protest songs with very little depth. But somehow, Worcester musician Sean Ryder has managed to capture the urgency with his new song and music video, Water is Life (Boots are on the Ground). 
 
Water isn't sacred anymore, sings Ryder, The river's black with oil and with blood./We can't drink that filth anymore./Bodies buried deep beneath the mud. 
 
In many ways, its a straight-up traditional protest song, born out of the large-scale protests that subsided when the Obama administration denied the project an easement to continue construction. Those protests are beginning to mobilize again, with President Trumps executive order to continue the project, so this song is particularly well-timed. 
 
Theres a tension between Ryders restrained vocals and his fuzzed-out, heavily distorted guitar that gives the song a rich texture. Ryder imbues each verse with a sort of melancholy, one accentuated by the videos use of footage from the protests, including footage of armed soldiers and police officers attacking protesters,who arebeing beaten, pelted with tear gas and sprayed with hoses. 
 
They'll tear us down swinging black batons, shouts Ryder, as the video reflects the reality of what hes singing, shoot pepper spray and tear gas in the crowd./Fire rubber bullets at our heads./Each wound a scar we'll wear it strong and proud. 
 
Its not a happy song, but then, its not a happy situation, and its one thats set to begin again imminently. But even as Ryder offers the ominous refrain, boots are on the ground  casting the situation as an act of war, being waged against the indigenous population  one can still find a spark of hope burning in the song, a sense that, even though the odds are overwhelming, defiance isnt a lost cause.
