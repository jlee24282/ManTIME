<TITLE>Kcee Has A Career Today Because Of Me  Harrysong</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Things are definitely getting heated between Harrysong and his former label Five Star Music

 

The latters team has finally released a statement surrounding the entire fracas slamming claims that he begged to be signed

Via the statement released by Alterplate and obtained by Thenetng it reads It was 8 am and Policemen acting on the instruction of the Assistant Inspector General of Police in Onikan stormed our hotel room to invite Harrysong over for questioning Desmond a representative for Alterplate saidAs a law abiding citizen with nothing to fear we got dressed up and set out for the AIGs office and on getting there we were greeted by the presence of a haggard looking young man in cheap pair of suit identified as Five Star Music lawyerOn the other hand as against the kangaroo statement released by Five Star music earlier today I wish to also state that Harrysong did not at any time approach anyone or company to sign him it was rather the other way round  Kcee approached Harrysong on bended knees to help salvage his dying career after he fell out with his then partner  On the N5million fee paid to Kelvin Luciano of Questionmark records Harrysongs team claimed it was their decision as they deemed it fit to sign him all cost

The team also bragged about savaging Kcees career as they managed to recreate his sound writing hit songs like  first meaningful single Had It Been I Know followed by Okpekete Limpopo Pull Over and other songs that defined the Kcee that everyone knows and celebrates today
