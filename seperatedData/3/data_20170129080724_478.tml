<TITLE>La La Land Wins Producers Guilds Top Movie Award (Complete List)</TITLE>
<TEXT>
"La La Land" has won the Producers Guild of Americas Darryl F. Zanuck Award for top feature film of 2016 for Fred Berger, Jordan Horowitz, and Marc Platt.

The musical defeated "Arrival," "Deadpool," "Fences," "Hacksaw Ridge," "Hell or High Water," "Hidden Figures," "Lion," "Manchester by the Sea," and "Moonlight."

The PGA has matched the Oscar for best picture in 19 of its 27 years, though it diverged last year when the Zanuck award went to "The Big Short" and the Oscar went to "Spotlight." The two awards matched in the previous eight years with "Birdman," "12 Years a Slave," "Argo," "The Artist," "The Kings Speech," "The Hurt Locker," "Slumdog Millionaire," and "No Country for Old Men." Netflixs sci-fi series "Stranger Things" the Producers Guild of Americas Norman Felton Award for TV drama series.

The miniseries "O.J.: Made in America" won the PGAs documetnary award for Ezra Edelman and Caroline Waterlow. "The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story" won the David L. Wolper Award for Outstanding Producer of Long-Form Television.

The award, announced by Nicole Kidman, was the first trophy presented at the 28th annual PGA Awards ceremonies at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.

FXs "The People v. O.J. Simpson," based on the O.J. Simpson 1994 murder case, debuted in February. It won nine Emmys in September.

Disneys "Zootopia" won the animated movie trophy for producer Clark Spencer. In his acceptance speech, Spencer said that he was driven by the need to tell a story about the importance of diversity, using the setting of a mammalian motropolis.

FXs freshman series "Atlanta" won the Danny Thomas award for best episodic comedy.

The award went to Donald Glover, Dianne McGunigle, Paul Simms, Hiro Murai, and Alex Orr. The series won Golden Globes this month for best television series  musical or comedy while Glover won the best actor award in that category.

Netflixs "Making a Murderer" won the award for non-fiction TV for Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos. The series explored the case of Stephen Avery, who spent 18 years in prison on a wrongful conviction.

NBCs "The Voice" won the reality competition trophy. "Comedians in Getting Coffee in Cars" took the digital series trophy while "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver" won the live entertainment-talk award.
