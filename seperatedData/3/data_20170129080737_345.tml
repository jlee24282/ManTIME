<TITLE>Arsenal and Manchester United set for 85m transfer war over La Liga superstar</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Arsenal are reportedly set to challenge Manchester United for the signing of Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann this summer. The 25-year-old has established himself as one of the top players in world football during his time with Atleti, and in turn its no surprise to see Premier League clubs interested in his securing his signature. According to The Daily Mail, Arsenal are ready to rival United having failed with an initial bid to sign him last summer and although the Red Devils remain the favourites to land the French international, its claimed that the Gunners are ready to make their move. Its added that Griezmann would cost 85m, as set by the release clause in his contract, and that Arsenal would be open to paying more than 250,000-a-week to a player of the forwards calibre. Both Chelsea and Manchester City are also mentioned in the report as ultimately both have the resources to rival their Premier League counterparts, but it appears as though United lead the way with Arsenal set to compete with them at this stage. United would have to be favoured given that it would bean unprecedented amount of money for Arsenal to spend, while there is also the additional role that Paul Pogba could play in persuading his international teammate to join him at Old Trafford. In turn, Jose Mourinho could be adding another marquee signing to his squad this summer, with the report adding that Atleti may well feel as though the time is right to cash in on their prolific Frenchman. Griezmann has scored 52 goals in 94 La Liga appearances since joining the capital club from Real Sociedad in 2014, but it looks as though hell have two big options to start a new challenge in England ahead of next season.
