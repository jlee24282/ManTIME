<TITLE>Big Match Feature: DRC v Ghana  SuperSport</TITLE>
<TEXT>
:16 
Ghana will test their title-winning credentials when the Black Stars take on DR Congos Leopards in the quarterfinals of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations on Sunday. 
 
The Black Stars, four-time winners of the competition, have a massive task ahead of them in the shape of a resurgent DRC side, who topped a tough the group that had the likes of Ivory Coast and Togo to qualify for the quarterfinals. 
 
Coach Avram Grants side started the competition with a slim 1-0 win over the Cranes of Uganda and though they won the game, they werent convincing enough as Uganda pushed them all the way. 
 
They followed that up with another 1-0 win, this time over Mali, which saw them clinch a spot in the quarters with a game to spare. 
 
Egypt was a bridge too far for the Black Stars as they lost 1-0 but with qualification already in the bag, there was very little to worry about. 
 
The DRC will be a different proposition for Ghana, who lost in the final to the Ivory Coast 8-7 on penalties in the last Afcon tournament in Equatorial Guinea. 
 
Florent Ibenge has built a very compact side who are difficult to beat and have proven they are a force to be reckoned with in the tournament. They defeated a much-fancied Moroccan side and held pre-tournament favourites Ivory Coast to a 2-2 draw. 
 
In Junior Kabananga they have a striker in red hot form. He has scored in all of the Dross games so far and will look to add to his tally against the Black Stars. 
 
The Leopards have built a strong defensive unit and are a joy to watch going forward, as they showed in the game against the Ivory Coast. 
 
ROAD TO THE QUARTERFINAL 
 
DR Congo qualified for the last eight of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations by topping Group C with two wins and a draw.

DR Congo 3 (Junior Kabananga, Firmin Ndombe Mubele, Paul-Jose MPoku) Togo 1 (Kodjo Laba)

Ghana 1 (Asamoah Gyan) Mali 0 
 
Egypt 1 (Abdallah Said) Ghana 0 
 
TEAM NEWS 
 
Ghana will be sweating on the fitness of skipper Asamoah Gyan, who limped out of the game against Egypt with a suspected groin injury. There has been no confirmation as to how long he will be out but he is a major doubt for the game against the DRC. 
 
Mubarak Wakaso, Thomas Partey, Jordan Ayew and Frank Acheampong were rested for the tie against Egypt but will surely be recalled against the Leopards. 
 
Florent Ibenge doesnt have any injury concerns as he has a full complement of players to call upon for the Black Stars test. 
 
PLAYERS TO WATCH 
 
Junior Kabananga (DR Congo) 
 
The giant striker is the top scorer in the competition with three goals, scoring in each match during the group stages. 
 
Kabananga [above wearing number 6 ] is a tall and physically imposing striker who is also a major threat aerially, as he showed with that bullet header against the Elephants of Ivory Coast. 
 
Head Coach Florent Ibenge will hope the Astana of Kazakhstan striker continues in his rich vein of form and helps propel DR Congo to a first semifinal since 1998 in Burkina Faso. 
 
Christian Atsu (Ghana) 
 
The Newcastle United winger, alongside Thomas Partey, has been one of the stand-out performers in a Ghana side hoping to lift the title they havent won since 1982. 
 
Atsu [below] is a pacy winger who is full of tricks playing from either the left or right flank like he does for the Black Stars. 
 

 
He was immense in Ghanas first two group games against Uganda and Mali, taking on defenders and getting the crosses in for the likes of Asamoah Gyan and Andre Ayew to thrive on. 
 
With Gyan a doubt for the game against DR Congo, Ghana coach Avram Grant will likely bring on Tetteh to complement the attack while relying on Atsu to supply the ammunition needed to edge out the Leopards. 
 
PROBABLE LINE-UPS 
 
DR Congo: Matambi; Issama, Ikoko, Tisserand, Mbemba; Maghoma, Kebano, Bope, Mubele;Kabananga, Mbokani. 
 
Ghana: Razak; Partey, Afful, Acheampong, Boye, Amartey, Atsu, Wakaso, J. Ayew, A. Ayew, Tetteh.
