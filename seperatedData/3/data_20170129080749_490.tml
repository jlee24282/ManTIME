<TITLE>Oprah will hawk meals for Kraft</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The media magnate is starting a joint venture with Kraft called Mealtime Stories, aiming to make nutritious food more widely available, according to a statement last week. Kraft will develop and sell the new line, which will initially focus on ready-to-eat refrigerated dishes.

Winfrey is known for having far-reaching influence. After she joined Weight Watchers board and bought a 10 percent stake in 2015, shares of the long-suffering company rallied.

Weight Watchers has no connection to the Mealtime effort, though the companies have a long history: In an earlier incarnation, Heinz owned the weight-loss program.

Amazon has agreed to change parts of its e-book contracts with publishers in an effort to avoid European Union fines for anti-competitive behavior.

The European Commission said last week that the online giant has committed not to enforce any contract clause that might force publishers to offer Amazon similar terms and conditions as those offered to competitors.

Publishers can also terminate e-book contracts that contain a certain clause linking discount possibilities for an e-book to the retail price of it on another platform. The commitment would apply for five years to agreements reached in Europe.

The Commission, which polices anti-trust issues, says Amazons parity clauses could breach EU rules, reduce competition and limit choice for consumers.

Athletic retailer The Finish Line Inc. last week announced a plan to exit the unprofitable JackRabbit business (formerly Running Specialty Group). The Indianapolis company has entered into a definitive agreement with affiliates of CriticalPoint Capital LLC, a private investment firm in Los Angeles.
