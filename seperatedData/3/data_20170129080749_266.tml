<TITLE>Dining Review: Italian flavor overarches diners at Teresas</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By WARE - Its got a bit of banquet in its feel as well as its name, Teresas Restaurant & Banquet. Feast is also part of the feeling you get watching a parade of plastic bags filled with myriad Styrofoam containers makes its to the parking lot in a processional march. 
 
But we cant omit Italy or family from the recipe of feelings that attach to this nearly 37-year-old community icon along Route 32 in the south of Ware. Romanesque arches run in lines along the textured walls of much of the dining area, matched by mirrors of the same shape and size in the remaining portion. The cityscape and still-life paintings between the arched openings, like Teresas food offerings, wear the Ferrentino familys birthplace proudly. The dark wooden tables add a rustic vibe. 
 
Most of the dinners, from $10 pasta to $27 Zuppa de Pesce, offer soup of the day or salad and a starch. These number more than 60 entre selections. And thats not counting grinders, an eight-item childrens menu from chicken fingers to stuffed shells, all $7-$8, and a page of specialty pizzas. 
 
Many but not all are red-sauce items, and the half-dozen veal dinners dont simply mimic the chicken selections. There is a larger array of seafood, from fried American favorites to Haddock Florentine with Spinach and a Cream Lemon Sauce ($18), and several more. Several beef selections are on or off the menu. Our Saturday-night entrance was greeted by the specials chalkboard that spoke of two prime ribs, Italian and regular. Our server never spoke of the specials to us, so good thing for you I was in a literate frame of mind. 
 
When it comes to appetizers its pretty darn Italian, running from $7 to $11 (no Buffalo wings here) with your calamaris to your antipastos and but also including Joes Polpette including two meatballs in marinara sauce and ricotta cheese ($9). And there are five selections with add-ons from scallops to steak, besides the side salads so easy to get with dinner. 
 
In this general area I paused at the Tortellini Soup ($3 or $5) but went with a Meat Tortellini Alfredo ($8) appetizer  theres also a $15 meal portion  and soup of the day, Orzo Minestrone, that was included with my entre. I never looked back. 
 
The tortellini had trace amounts of sausage which lent not as much flavor as the blend of Romano, Parmsan and mozzarella cheeses that bathed the perfectly cooked pasta. The soups tomato broth was talking to me with its peppery flavor and wide assortment of vegetables, reassuring me that it was just what the doctor ordered for my early-stage sore throat. 
 
Sometimes a place in its fourth decade is still doing the same with bread it was when it opened, but I cant imagine thats the case here. The rolls before dinner came warm with a medium-crisp crust and airy soft insides, served with an herb-garlic olive oil. 
 
By dinner we chickened out. My companions Chicken Broccoli with EVOO and Garlic ($16) over pasta did all its supposed to do, with large chicken chunks and a boatload of broccoli. 
 
I went with Chicken Breast a la Calabrese, a large rolled breast topped with mozzarella cheese in a buttery sherry wine sauce ($18). Cut inside the tender tube and let flow a molten river of mozzarella with parsely, reaching a waiting throng of button-size mushrooms that accompany this rich, rich dish. The accompanying pasta, on the side, had a sweet, chunky marinara sauce for contrast. Leave the cardiologist at home and take a dive into this dish. 
 
An adequate tiramisu was $6 at the top end of a dessert selection of cannoli, ice cream cake roll or cheesecake with or without strawberries. Dessert was, at this point, too much to finish even while splitting it  but no surprise here. The pleasant surprise was dinner for two, coffee/tea included, was right around $50 for a generous, multicourse spread, before taxes and tip. 
 
It could have been a busier night, as evidenced by the squad of servers seeming to await a Saturday-night full house that never arrived. While there were families and young children aplenty as well as elder parties, a swath may have been held away by a Patriots playoff game running at the same time. 
 
To say Teresas was ready and able to serve would be a vast understatement; its known also as a banquet and special events place, remember? But seven days a week, even the casual evening diner can simply be ready to be well taken care of.
