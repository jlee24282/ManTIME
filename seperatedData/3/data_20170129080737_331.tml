A day after former Union Minster SM Krishna resigned from the Congress, the senior leader hit out at the party saying it doesn't need mass leaders and wants only managers. 
 
"Congress doesn't need mass leaders these days, they only want managers who can handle a situation," he said at the press conference in Bengaluru where he made a formal announcement on his resignation. 
 
"What pained me was how the Congress sidelined a loyal worker and cited my age for sidelining me," the veteran leader said. 
 
It is believed that his decision to leave the party was prompted by the alleged high-handedness and dictatorial behaviour of Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah . 
 
Krishna, a former Karnataka chief minister, sent his resignation to party president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday, but his letter to Gandhi did not elaborate on the reasons for his departure. 
 
Krishna served as the Minster of External Affairs in the UPA II government under former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and also had a run as the governor of Maharashtra. 
 
Here is all that he said: 
 According to me, age is a state of mind. Age should not be a criteria for deciding what the situation needs. There are people who are inactive even when young. Ultimate test is your intent.  The party demands only managers. They don't need time-tested leaders and workers like me.  I toured the state during the last elections and nobody thought I was old. Suddenly, they have discovered that I am old and need rest. I felt the Congress did not need me.  This is a time to do some introspection. I took this decision (resigning from the Congress) just a day before. I did not consult anyone but my wife.
