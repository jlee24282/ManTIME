<TITLE>Reimbursements buoy county payrolls</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Reimbursements from state and federal government offset payroll in Pennsylvania counties. 
 
Its a result of employees performing mandated tasks, such as complying with initiatives to clean up the Chesapeake Bay  including managing storm water runoff into creeks and the Susquehanna River  or carrying out foster care placements by Children and Youth. 
 
If youre going to mandate certain things, you really need to provide the financing for us to be able to carry that out. Thats not to say if we didnt that wed just fully stop, Commissioner John Mathiassaid. 
 
Eligibility and reimbursement vary by department, according to Union County Finance Director Jeffrey McClintock. For example, two employees in the Conservation District are paid in full by the county, he said, while others are reimbursed 100 percent. The average reimbursement in that department,which has eight employees, is 60 percent, he said. 
 
The average reimbursement for eligible salaries of the Children and Youth departments 17 employees is 80 percent, McClintock said. Reimbursement for Children and Youthranges from 50 percent to as high as 90 percent, he said. 
 
Eligible salaries for Domestic Relations, which has nine employees, are reimbursed at 66 percent, McClintock said. The salary for District Attorney D. Peter Johnson is reimbursed at 65 percent. 
 
The 911 center receives operations grant funding funneled through the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency. McClintock said it can cover employee salaries at 100 percent. However, if costs exceed grant funding, the runover is paid from county coffers, he said. 
 
For 2016, I can tell you all the salaries, wages and benefits were covered at 100 percent, McClintock said. They should all be covered in 2017 until they go to the joinder, he continued, referencing the planned consolidation of 911 services with Snyder County. 
 
The victim-witnesscoordinator position, too, is covered by grant funding, McClintock said, with any potential cost overruns paid with victim service fees paid by criminal offenders. Grant funds totaled $60,329 over the previous two years, he said. 
 
The salary for the county recycling director is reimbursed at 50 percent and the salary for Union Countys detective in the district attorneys office is paid at the moment in full through a grant, McClintock said. Probation also sees reimbursement through supervisory fees, which totaled about $91,000 in 2016. 
 
The county historical society is self-funded. McClintock said the society reimburses the county for two part-time positions.
