<TITLE>Google learns from Pixel launch</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Although Google hasnt released sales figures, industry researchers say the Pixel has been a hot item since its October debut was greeted with mostly glowing reviews and the biggest marketing blitz in Googles 18-year history. Google didnt have enough Pixels available to meet demand. Rather than wait several weeks, many consumers interested in the Pixel probably bought an iPhone, Galaxy or another phone instead. And these people arent likely to need a phone replacement for another year or two.

Google also struck a deal to sell it through just one wireless carrier, Verizon. Although Googles online store sold Pixels compatible with other wireless networks, most people dont shop for phones that way.

Its not surprising that Google misjudged the market, given that this is the search companys first stab at making its own phone. Previously, it partnered with various manufacturers on a Nexus line of phones to showcase its Android operating system, but that effort barely made a dent.

This was probably a really good learning experience for them, says Neil Doshi, an analyst with Mizhuo Securities USA.

The Pixels success is important to Google because it wants to ensure theres a stylish Android phone to compete with the iPhone and drive more affluent consumers to its search engine, maps, YouTube videos and other services.

Samsungs Galaxy and other phones also run on Android, but those devices have been de-emphasizing Googles services.

Google, in Mountain View, California, can afford to make some mistakes as it tries to establish the Pixel because its internet search and advertising network brings in so much revenue.

Alphabet, Googles corporate parent, provided another reminder of its financial might with Thursdays release of its fourth-quarter earnings. The company earned $5.3 billion on revenue of $26 billion during the final three months of last year and profit rose 8 percent from the prior year.

The numbers provide a clue on how Pixel did. Googles other revenue segment, which covers sales outside of advertising, generated $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, a 62 percent increase from the same time last year.

Doshi estimates Google sold 1 million to 1.5 million Pixels during the fourth quarter. Thats just a sliver of the estimated 77 million that Apple sold and the 15 million Galaxy S7s Samsung sold in the same period.

Still, analysts say the Pixel did exceptionally well for a new phone with little brand recognition.
