<TITLE>Sizzling Heat beat Pistons for seventh win in a row</TITLE>
<TEXT>
MIAMI -- Goran Dragic scored eight of his 23 points in the fourth quarter and the Miami Heat extended their win streak to seven games, defeating the Detroit Pistons 116-103 on Saturday night at AmericanAirlines Arena. 

Miami also got 19 points from Wayne Ellington, 18 points from James Johnson and 17 points from Dion Waiters, including 13 in the first quarter. Miami shot 53.2 percent from the floor. 

The Heat (18-30) have the longest active win streak in the NBA. It's also Miami's longest win streak since February 2014. 

Detroit (21-26) was led by center Andre Drummond's 17 points and game-high 20 rebounds. He got off to a great start with nine points and eight rebounds in the first quarter. His game-long effort helped Detroit build a 62-40 edge in points in the paint. 

Reggie Jackson was Detroit's leading scorer with 24 points. 

Heat center Hassan Whiteside, who entered the game averaging 16.9 points and 13.9 rebounds, made his return from an ankle injury but was ineffective against Drummond. Whiteside was held to nine points and 12 rebounds. 

The first quarter, which featured seven lead changes and four ties, ended with Miami leading 35-33. The Heat, who shot 65.0 percent from the field in the quarter and were 4 of 6 on 3-pointers, never led by more than two points. 

Miami shot 57.9 percent from the floor in the second quarter and took a 64-60 advantage into halftime. There were four more lead changes and four ties in the second quarter, but Heat reserve James Johnson's 11 points in nine-plus minutes made the difference. 

There were nine lead changes and seven ties as the game remained tight in the third quarter. Detroit shot 72.2 percent from the field in the quarter to take a 91-90 lead entering the fourth quarter. 

But the Heat prevailed in the fourth to keep their streak alive. 

NOTES: Heat C Hassan Whiteside, who missed Friday's game with a sprained right ankle, returned. ... Heat G Tyler Johnson (left shoulder) missed his fifth straight game. ... Heat SG Josh Richardson (sprained left foot) hasn't played since Jan 6, when he was a starter. With Richardson out, SG Dion Waiters has flourished in his spot. Richardson is not yet able to sprint and still feels discomfort. ... Pistons C Andre Drummond, who was an All-Star last year, was snubbed this time around. ... The Heat signed 6-foot-8 undrafted rookie F Okaro White, who played at Florida State, to a second 10-day contract. ... Up next, the Pistons visit the Boston Celtics on Saturday and the Heat play host to the Brooklyn Nets on Monday.

Afghanistan's Defense Ministry says it wants to raise the number of women serving in the Afghan National Army to a level where women comprise 10 percent of the force. 

Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanesh said on January 27 that the government had set several measures, including a special salary scale for female recruits, to encourage more women to join up. 

'At this stage, we have 1,575 Afghan women in our army ranks, it is a mere 3 to 4 percent -- which is nothing,' Radmanesh said. 'We are aiming to raise this percentage to 10 percent.' 

Radmanesh said there currently were about 400 Afghan women recruits training at Defense Ministry facilities. 

Women serving in the military is a controversial topic in conservative Afghanistan.
