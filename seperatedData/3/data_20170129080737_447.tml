<TITLE>Simon looks forward to Riverside Sheriffs' Association All-Star Classic</TITLE>
<TEXT>
TEMECULA  No one ever wants to endure a 1-9 season that sees a coach walk away at the end of the year, and you can count senior Zak Simon in that group.

But Simon is never one to pout or sing a tale of woe about his situation. On the contrary, Friday nights in 2016 were still memorable for one of the top athletes walking the campus at Temecula Valley High School.

Besides the losses, I had a lot of fun and was very close to teammates, Simon said Friday. I would say I had a great season fun-wise. I played my heart out every game. Its great to have another opportunity to play another game.

That chance comes tomorrow, Jan. 28, in the first Riverside Sheriffs Association All-Star Football Classic at 7 p.m. at Norte Vista High School. The game features two teams of Riverside County seniors, with one, the Northwest All-Stars, coached by Valley Views Dan Barlage, and the other, the Southeast All-Stars, coached by Paloma Valleys Bert Esposito.

Simon, whos in the middle of basketball season with the league title-contending Bears, said he takes the field tonight with the full support of basketball coach Kyle Armstrong.

He loves it, even with missing our game Saturday, said Simon, a spot starter for a Bears team that plays a nonleague game at Saddleback Valley Christian tonight. He loves that I have another chance.

Getting ready for an a football game certainly required a shift in gears.

Its kind of weird, because the concepts are different, Simon added. I was just getting used to basketball, and then I get invited to this All-Star game. But its kind of nice to play another game of football.

A 6-foot, 170-pound speedy receiver, Simon caught 42 passes last season for 481 yards and two scores. His production was stymied when injuries forced him to quarterback for a few games  though he loved it  and by an offense than admittedly struggled, scoring little more than 10 points per game.

Temecula Valley wound up closing its season with five consecutive losses  all in league  and third-year coach Rick Mey, who led the Bears to their first playoff berth in a decade in 2014, resigned after the season.

It couldve been a lot to hang a head over. Simon didnt.

Playing QB was fun because Im really close with my quarterback (Shane Oberhuber), Simon said. Weve worked out since freshman year and have gone to camps. We always talked about what if I played quarterback and he played receiver.

We just had a blast, he added. He was teaching a lot, and I had to pick it up quick.

Tonight, however, will be all about showing what he can do as a receiver. Two years ago, Simon caught 59 passes for 881 yards and eight touchdowns as the passing complement to running back Lika Palmer, who still refers to Simon as one of his guys, even after Palmers transfer to Murrieta Valley.

Big numbers of not, Simons talent should have him playing somewhere on Saturdays, and he said hes narrowed his choices to Wyoming, Idaho, San Diego State and Weber State.
