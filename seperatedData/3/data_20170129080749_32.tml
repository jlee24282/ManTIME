Wrestlers from all four Wilkes County schools traveled to Ashe County High School for the Mountain Valley Athletic Conference Individual tournament Saturday. All four schools were competitive and the day was a success. 
 
Wilkes County was represented in 10 of the 14 weight classes with county wrestlers coming home as the tournament conference champion. 
 
West Wilkes crowned three champions and Wilkes Central and East Wilkes finished with two finals winners apiece. North Wilkes finished the day with one winner. 
 
On the team score side, West trailed all day but came from behind to take the team title by 2.5 points against the regular season winner Elkin. Wilkes Central, North Wilkes and East Wilkes finished fourth, fifth and sixth, respectively. 
 
West Wilkes is expected to compete in the dual state tournament beginning with the first round on Tuesday night. Each MVAC school will have wrestlers competing in the individual regional tournaments in two weeks.
