<TITLE>Family plea for information on missing woman</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The family of a missing Auckland woman say they are going through hell not knowing where she is. 
 
Carissa Avison, 21, has been missing since Thursday morning. Police have confirmed she was on Holder Pl on the North Shore around 10am that day.  
 
She then received a ride from Holder Pl to Coast Rd in Muriwai on Auckland's west coast, wearing black Nike sports shoes with white soles, black 3/4 leggings and a white t-shirt. She was carrying a dark blue Country Road canvas duffle bag. 
  
Her family have said the disappearance is out of character for the goal-driven woman. 

 
Anna Stadniczenko, Ms Avison's cousin, was meant to have dinner with her on Friday night, but her texts went unanswered. 
 
"I messaged her a couple of times because it's just not like her not to show up, [and] as I was going to bed I heard from my uncle that she was reported missing," Ms Stadniczenko said. 
 
"We all love her and miss her and just want to know that she's okay... and want anyone with any information to let us know." 
 
Police are still seeking any sightings of Ms Avison or information about her whereabouts, and want to thank the members of the public who have already come forward with information. 
 
Anyone with information can contact Auckland police on (09) 302 6400 or report anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
