<TITLE>Kid Kesler steals the show at the NHL All-Star Skills Competition</TITLE>
<TEXT>
LOS ANGELES >> Ryker Kesler skated directly at Carey Price in the NHL Shootout, the final event of the six-event Skills Competition on Saturday at Staples Center. Kesler drifted to his right, waited for Price to move with him and then slipped the puck between the goaltenders legs and into the back of the net. 
 
Kesler fell to the ice, leaped to his skates and began pumping his arms in celebration. 
 
Bedlam. 
 
Wait, who in the heck is Ryker Kesler, you ask? 
 
Well, he is the 6-year-old son of Ryan Kesler, the Ducks All-Star center, and he stole the show on the eve of the All-Star Game while wearing an enemy jersey on foreign ice, a place where Kings fans never hold back their feelings for their Southern California rivals. 
 
Ryan Kesler planned to send Ryker in his place and it went better than either could have expected. Ryan Kesler was booed heavily when he was introduced before the event, reveling in it and blowing kisses to the crowd. Ryker got nothing but cheers from the fans, however. 
 
I was nervous, Ryan Kesler would later say. I was more nervous than him.  Amazing. It was pretty special. It was the perfect ending. 
 
Asked about Rykers celebration, Ryan said, I think I taught you that, right? 
 
Yeah, Ryker said, smiling while standing with his dad in a crowded dressing room. 
 
The Atlantic Division defeated the Keslers Pacific Division in the shootout 4-1 and earned the right to pick its opponent for Sundays 3-on-3 semifinal tournament. The Atlantic selected to play the Metropolitan in the second 20-minute semifinal. The defending champion Pacific will face the Central in the first semi. 
 
The winners then face off in the third period. 
 Hardest shot  
Montreal Canadiens defenseman Shea Weber went into the event as the defending champion, winning on home ice last season while playing with the Nashville Predators. There was some that thought that he could break the all-time record of 108.8 mph by Boston Bruins defenseman Zdeno Chara. 
 
Weber won, but he didnt come close to Charas mark, posting a speed of 102.8 mph on a slap shot launched from a distance of 30 feet directly in front of the net. Winnipeg Jets rookie Patrik Laine was second with a speed of 101.7. Kings defenseman Drew Doughtys fastest shot was 94.6 mph. 
 
Each shooter had two attempts. 
 
The first one, I felt like I hit good, Weber said. I thought it would be a little bit harder. I was saving more for the second shot because I was sitting around for two hours. I kind of wanted to work my way up. And then I missed the second one. I hit it too far behind the puck and kind of missed it. 
 
 Skills challenge relay  
This timed relay event involved seven skaters and one goalie from each of the teams, and was probably the least well-received by an announced sellout crowd of more than 18,000. One-timed shooting, accuracy passing, puck control and stick-handling were the disciplines involved. 
 
The Metropolitan Division, including Washingtons Alexander Ovechkin and Pittsburghs Sidney Crosby, posted a winning time of 1 minute, 21.70 seconds. The Atlantic was second in 1:39.69, the Central was third in 1:44.03 and the Pacific was fourth in 2:02.12. 
 
Joe Pavelski of the Sharks and Kesler scored on their first tries on their one-timers, getting the Pacific off to a good start. Jeff Carter of the Kings misfired on his first two tries before hitting the net and then Doughty struggled to find the mark in the passing portion. 
 Faster skater  
Connor McDavids blinding speed pops up often in nightly highlight shows and Edmontons 20-year-old star backed up the perception that he is the NHLs fastest skater as he had the quickest time out of the eight participants. 
 
McDavid beat another fleet skater, Colorados Nathan MacKinnon, in his head-to-head race as he covered the rink layout in 13.020 seconds to MacKinnons 13.620. 
 
Hes unbelievable fast, McDavid said. I was really nervous. I was a little worried. I thought he was going to fly. Definitely a great skater in his own way. 
 
Said MacKinnon, joking he got caught sleeping: Not a bad guy to lose to. 
 
McDavids best time was better than the record of 13.172 seconds set by Detroits Dylan Larkin last year. It wont be recognized as such because McDavid didnt do it in the full lap at the end after beating MacKinnon, with his final skate clocking in at 13.310. 
 
Already, there was a controversy brewing because McDavid began from a full stop while Larkin was able to begin his start already in motion. 
 
Itd be nice to see if you got a running start like last time, McDavid said. Would that shave off .2 seconds? Im not too sure. 
 Four line challenge  
Mike Smith doesnt have All-Star numbers as the goalie for struggling Arizona. Smith is 11-13-5 with a 2.85 goals-against average and a .917 save percentage but he is in the game as the Coyotes representative. 
 
As one of the NHLs best handlers of the puck among netminders, Smith validated his appearance by shooting the puck the length of the ice from his own net into a tight opening at the opposing end. 
 
I knew it had a chance but I didnt know it was going to curl in like that, Smith said. I think I was just as surprised as Bo Horvat was. Looking over at him was a pretty cool moment. 
 
Smith said he didnt put any extra English on his shot and that it was more fluke than anything. But the shot got a huge ovation at Staples Center, where hes normally a visiting goalie to be jeered. 
 
Yeah, I got booed at the start and then they came around and cheered for me at the end, Smith said. Its all good. Im not sure Im here for my goal scoring but it was a cool moment and probably one Ill cherish for a long time. 
 Accuracy shooting  
Torontos Auston Matthews showed off his skills by clearly hitting the four targets on each corner of the net in five tries but Pittsburgh star Sidney Crosby would better him by doing it faster in 10.730 seconds to 12.280 seconds. 
 
He made me look bad there, Matthews said. I was feeling good about myself after and then he goes and does that. Thats why hes the best player in the world. 
 
Matthews said he got pinpoint passes from Ottawas Erik Karksson on his one-time shots but found the event more challenging than it originally looked. 
 
Its smaller than it seems, Matthews said of the targets. Its tough just going right into it, not really warming up or anything. Of course, youre pretty nervous beforehand anyways. I think I tuned it pretty well.
