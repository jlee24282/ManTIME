<TITLE>Chicago man arrested in death of Minneapolis bartender knocked out by punch</TITLE>
<TEXT>
CHICAGO  Minneapolis police have arrested a Chicago man suspected of throwing a punch that left unconscious a bartender who moments later was accidentally run over by a taxi. 
   
A video released by the family of 32-year-old Marques Gaines shows more than a dozen people doing nothing to help him after he was punched by a man and fell to the ground Feb. 7. The video shows his cellphone and debit card being stolen. 
 
The Chicago Tribune reported the man who allegedly threw the punch was arrested Monday on a warrant issued by authorities in Chicago. 
 
The man is unidentified because he hasnt been formally charged. He appeared before a Hennepin County, Minnesota judge on Wednesday and waived extradition to Cook County. 
 
Gaines family settled wrongful death and negligence lawsuits against several businesses and taxi companies in his death.
