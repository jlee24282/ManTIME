GBP Fantasy Springs Jan 28  Oscar De La Hoya nd his Golden Boy Promotions were in Indio, California on Saturday night with a nine fight boxing card that saw the main events air on HBO After Dark. 
 
WBC world lightweight champion Francisco Vargas entered his second title defense against rugged Miguel Berchelt with a reputation for getting into wars in his last two fights and contender Miguel Berchelt wanted to make it a third rough fight in a row for Vargas. He succeeded as Vargas was bloodied and swollen entering the second half of the fight while Berchelt remained fresh. Berchelt pressured in the final rounds and he was rewarded with the referee stop late in the final round to take the win. Mexicos Miguel Berchelt goes to 31-1 and the 25 year old is your new WBC world lightweight champion. 
 
In the twelve round co-feature former WBC world super featherweight champion Takashi Miura faced off against veteran Miguel Roman. The feeling out process did not take long between the two sluggers were throwing heavy punches throughout rounds two, three and four in attritive fashion. Roman seemed to get throughand hurt Miura in the middle rounds, but Miura dug deep and upped his punch output. A head butt bloodied Roman and starching body shots strted to count in round 10 and 11, when Roman tasted the canvas in each round. Miura came out with bad intentins in the final round and Roman had very little left. He hit the canvas in the first minute and Roman could not beat the count as Miura earns the KO at 53 seconds of RD 12.
