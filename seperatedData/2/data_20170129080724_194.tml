A joint statement from Prince William and Prince Harry said: It has been 20 years since our mothers death and the time is right to recognise her positive impact in the UK and around the world with a permanent statue. 
 
Our mother touched so many lives. We hope the statue will help all those who visit Kensington Palace to reflect on her life and her legacy, the statement added.
