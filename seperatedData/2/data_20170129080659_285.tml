<TITLE>Letter to the editor: Treat each human being with humanity</TITLE>
<TEXT>
There is no one who loves this country more than I, or can claim to be more patriotic then I, and I am a liberal.

However, there is an even more important label for me  citizen. I walked with many citizens on Jan. 22, the women in Tulsa and the sons and fathers who love and support them, all who are just as patriotic and full of love for this country.
