<TITLE>Landale leads No. 21 Saint Mary's past Santa Clara (Yahoo Sports)</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Even when he's not perfect, Jock Landale can shoulder a heavy load for No. 21 Saint Mary's.  The Australian center had 20 points and 11 rebounds but also some less sparkling moments in the Gaels' 72-59 win over Santa Clara on Saturday night.  Missed two free throws,'' Gaels coach Randy Bennett said.
