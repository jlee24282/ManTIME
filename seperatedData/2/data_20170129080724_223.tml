Virginia became a Registered Nurse after taking her training in Sheridan, Wyoming, Billings, and completing her rotations at St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula. She worked at Marcus Daly Memorial Hospital in Hamilton periodically during her younger adult years. Robert (Bob) Smyth met Ginny when he and other Montana State College students visited Billings for short weekend. They were married May 20, 1949, and resided in either the dairy farm house 3-1/2 miles north of Corvallis or in the house they built just south of town.
