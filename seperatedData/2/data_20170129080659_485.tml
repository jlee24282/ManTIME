<TITLE>Hamil sees Muskogee as 'community of opportunity'</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Leslie Hamil cherishes time she spends with special needs students. 
 
I probably get more hugs here in a day than you would get in a year somewhere else," said Hamil, a paraprofessional at Ben Franklin Science Academy. 
 
Hamil, 52, took a coast-to-coast journey to get there. 
 
The California native said her father was in the Air Force, so she lived in Arkansas, Maryland and Texas while growing up. 
 
"If I'd have been born two months earlier, I'd have lived in Guam," she said. 
 
After attending what was then Westark Community College in Fort Smith, Ark., Hamil worked in health care. 
 
After a few years, her journey took her to jobs with Girl Scouts, Muskogee'sYouth Volunteer Corps, then to BFSA. She remains active in YVC. 
 
But she has a heart for her BFSA students. 
 
"YVC not withstanding, if I knew 35 to 40 years ago what I know now, I probably would have gone a whole different direction in my career," she said. "It's just been one of the most fulfilling things." 
 
Continuing the 
 
scouting tradition 
 
Leslie Hamil's first involvement with Girl Scouts came in first and second grade. 
 
"With my dad being in the Air Force and traveling a lot, it was really hard to get into anything that was structured," Hamil recalled. "It was half of one year, half of another." 
 
That brief time had some impact. 
 
"My mom still has my uniform," she said. 
 
Hamil got a job with the local Girl Scout office in 2003. 
 
"When I started, I was in outreach, she said. That involved going to low-income housing, at-risk schools, working with girls in those areas, bringing the Girl Scout program to them and giving them something extra after school." 
 
She said scouting is an amazing program. 
 
It gives girls lots of learning opportunities, she said. "Thered be a lot of girls who would not have the chance to go to the different camps that they have, journeys they go on. 
 
Hamil now is a lifetime member, and her stepdaughter is on her way of becoming one. 
 
Shell be one when she graduates in May, Hamill said. That was one of the things she wanted for graduation was a lifetime membership to Girl Scouts." 
 
Hamil said scouting played a big part in making her daughter the kindhearted young woman she is. 
 
"Shes big into helping other people, she said. Well go some place, something will happen and shed say in Girl Scouts, we always leave a place better than the way we found it.' She looks back and she remembers what she was taught in Girl Scouts and she uses that. She even tells people that was where she learned it." 
 
A chance meeting 
 
with other volunteers 
 
Hamils involvement with youth switched when Girl Scouts were at a joint event with Youth Volunteer Corps, where she met YVC director Eileen Van Kirk. 
 
"I was kind of ready for a change and I talked with her about YVC, Hamil said. 
 
Hamil was hired as a team leader, overseeing volunteer groups at different projects. Teens helped during the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day pancake breakfast, parade and party. They help with donations at Fostering Hope. They collect donations and help ice skaters during Honor Heights Parks annual Garden of Lights. 
 
Our volunteers average about 100 hours of work a year, she said. They do a lot. 
 
Hamil said working with YVC has been awesome. 
 
Were working with teenagers who are there because they want to be there, she said. They want to volunteer their time. They want to help their community. 
 
She said several teens have chosen careers from things they did in YVC. 
 
There are some that are going into special education, occupational or physical therapy who have worked at Camp Bennett, Hamil said. Some want to work with animals who worked in our animal antics program. 
 
She said teens are at "a very important time in their life, when theyre trying to figure out where to go. 
 
Finding work with 
 
special needs students 
 
Hamils involvement with Youth Volunteer Corps led her to her current job as paraprofessional. 
 
She recalled bringing her teen volunteers to help at Camp Bennett, a Muskogee Public Schools summer camp for special needs youth and adults. 
 
"Once you work at Camp Bennett, you kind of fall in love with the kids, she said. There are two weeks of adults camp and three weeks of kids camp. There are a lot of activities  outdoor recreation, science and nature, games and music, fishing, bowling  some things kids dont get to do if they didnt have the camp. 
 
After a few summers, people with the district asked if she wanted to help special needs students as a paraprofessional. 
 
Theres kind of a cross-section of different kinds of disabilities, Hamil said. We work with them on anything, math, science, reading, English. Also life skills. 
 
Hamil said one thing her students need is to be treated like everybody else." 
 
You help them when they need help and understand that they can do a lot more than people think they can. You let them do everything they can do themselves and youre there to help and to guide them." 
 
Hamil said one her pleasures is seeing when they accomplish something, seeing them smile." 
 
It makes you feel great about yourself, knowing youre doing something thats helping, she said.
