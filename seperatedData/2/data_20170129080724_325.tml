<TITLE>Invader Opens Video Game-Inspired Solo Exhibition in Paris</TITLE>
<TEXT>
French street artist Invader returns with his irreverent brand of mosaic graffiti with the opening of his new exhibition, "Hello, My Name Is..." at Le Muse en Herbe in Paris. Invader was inspired by a manifesto written by a group of MIT hackers in the early days of video game history called The Theory of Computer Toys , which laid out three ground rules for video games: they should push the computer to its limits; each play should be different; and the game should be interactive. 
 
As a result, Invader created different artworks that reference milestone games such as Pong,  Breakout which was the first game created by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, Pac-Man and Tetris . The exhibition also includes a replica of Invader's studio, the Mothership.The show will run until September 3.
