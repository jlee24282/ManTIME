Debbie Pleu has been gardening for a few decades. Having owned an organic gardening operation in the 1980s, she left the business but later returned to grow into another branch of gardening. 
   
She now owns Pleu Gardens, which sells starts, transplants and flower bouquets at the Tulsa, Okla., Farmers Markets. With spring just a few months away, she is already in the throes of overseeing the growth of dozens of varieties of cool-weather vegetable plants, including broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower. 
   
Theres so much to do with timing of when to start planting your seeds, Pleu said. 
   
Because she is sowing seeds and raising plants with a commercial intent, she works a few weeks ahead of the home gardeners planting schedule. She shared several tips to help gardeners successfully grow plants from seeds and transplant to pots or plots and to enjoy the plants this spring. 
  
 Start simple  
  
Many plants are easy to grow from seeds. Tomatoes are popular with gardeners of varying experience. They do well in pots or in the ground, and there are so many varieties from which to choose, from cherry tomatoes to heirloom Cherokee Purples. 
   
A few other easy-to-grow seeds include eggplant, basil, squash and cucumbers. These plants require less maintenance or attention to start and raise into mature plants. 
  
 Use a calendar/journal  
  
Pleu has been using a journal to record dates when seeds are sown, notes about which plants shes growing and when theyre transplanted to their permanent place. 
   
Then throughout the season, she jots down details about harvests, locations and other things she might find useful for the following years planting. 
  
 Get organized  
  
When youre ready to start planting your seeds, pull together your materials and tools, including trays/containers, growing medium/potting soil, labels/popsicle sticks and seeds. Pleu said it can be easy to forget which seeds you just planted or which label belongs to which row of seeds. Plant one seed at a time and label the row as soon as youre done. 
  
 Water carefully  
  
Its important to maintain moisture in the growing medium because the seeds may die if they dry out after theyre sown. However, watering too much can cause the seeds to take on a disease called damping-off, which happens when the seeds become too wet and wont emerge from the soil. 
   
Use a digital thermometer to check the temperature of the soil to help the seeds germinate. 
  
 Be creative  
  
Its easy to get carried away buying trays and containers for starting seeds, but Pleu pointed out that old plastic containers missing lids can be used at no cost. Also, plastic cling wrap can be used in lieu of the plastic domes.
