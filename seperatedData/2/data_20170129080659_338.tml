<TITLE>Tired and weak? Don't assume it's just your age.</TITLE>
<TEXT>
When Dr. Christopher Callahan examines older patients, he often hears a similar refrain. 
   
Im tired, doctor. Its hard to get up and about. Ive been feeling kind of down, but I know Im getting old and I just have to live with it. 
   
This fatalistic stance relies on mistaken assumptions about what constitutes aging. 
   
In fact, fatigue, weakness and depression arent to-be-expected consequences of growing older, said Callahan, director of the Center for Aging Research at Indiana Universitys School of Medicine. 
   
Instead, theyre a signal that something is wrong and a medical evaluation is in order. 
   
People have a perception ... that aging equals decline, said Jeanne Wei, a geriatrician who directs the Donald W. Reynolds Institute on Aging at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Thats just wrong. 
   
Of course, peoples bodies do change as they get on in years, but this is a gradual process. If you suddenly find your thinking is cloudy and your memory unreliable, if youre overcome by dizziness and your balance is out of whack, if you find yourself tossing and turning at night and running urgently to the bathroom, dont chalk it up to normal aging. 
   
Go see your physician. The earlier you identify and deal with these problems, the better. 
   
Here are four common concerns that should spark attention. 
  
 Fatigue: You have no energy  
  
Dont underestimate the impact: Chronically weary older adults are at risk of losing their independence and becoming socially isolated. 
   
Nearly one-third of people age 51 and older experience fatigue, according to a 2010 study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. (Other estimates are lower.) 
   
There are plenty of potential culprits: Sleep problems, pain, gastrointestinal reflux and medications for blood pressure can induce fatigue, as can infections, arthritis, an underactive thyroid, poor nutrition and alcohol use. 
   
All can be addressed, doctors said. Perhaps most important is ensuring that older adults remain physically active. 
   
If someone comes into my office walking at a snails pace and tells me, Im old; Im just slowing down, Im, like, No, that isnt right, said Lee Ann Lindquist, a professor of geriatrics at Northwestern Universitys Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. 
  
 Loss of appetite  
  
This puts you at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies and frailty, and it raises the prospect of an earlier-than-expected death. Between 15 and 30 percent of older adults are believed to have whats known as the anorexia of aging. 
   
Physical changes associated with aging  notably declines in vision, taste and smell, all of which make food attractive  can contribute. So can other conditions: decreased saliva production (a medication-induced problem that affects about one-third of older adults); constipation (affecting up to 40 percent of seniors); social isolation (people dont like to eat alone); dental problems; and illnesses and infections. 
  
 Depression  
  
Depression in later life can have profound consequences, compounding the effects of chronic illnesses such as heart disease, leading to disability, affecting cognition and, in extreme cases, resulting in suicide. 
   
Once, it was believed melancholia was common in later life and that seniors withdrew from the world as they realized that their days were limited, Callahan explained. Since then, researchers have shown that older adults tend to be happier than other age groups: Only 15 percent have major depression or minor variants. 
   
Late-life depression is typically associated with a serious illness such as diabetes, cancer, arthritis or stroke; deteriorating hearing or vision; and life changes such as retirement or the loss of a spouse. 
  
 Weakness  
  
You may have sarcopenia  a notable loss of muscle mass and strength that affects about 10 percent of adults older than 60. If untreated, sarcopenia will affect your balance, mobility and stamina, and raise the risk of falling, becoming frail and losing independence. 
   
Age-related muscle atrophy, which begins when people reach their 40s and accelerates when theyre in their 70s, is part of the problem. Muscle strength declines even more rapidly  slipping about 15 percent per decade starting around age 50. 
   
The solution: exercise, including resistance and strength training exercises, and good nutrition, including getting adequate amounts of protein. 
   
Watch for sudden changes. If youre not as strong as you were yesterday, thats not right, Wei said. 
   
Taking steps to address weakness doesnt mean youll have the same strength and endurance as when you were in your 20s or 30s. But it may mean that doctors catch a serious or preventable problem early and forestall further decline.
