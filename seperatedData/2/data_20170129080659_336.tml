<TITLE>Women's College Basketball: Wolves score 90 in road win</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Northern State's highest shooting percent of the season led to its greatest offensive output as the women's basketball team dominated Southwest Minnesota State for a 90-65 Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference win on the road.

Northern (15-5, 11-5) made 60.7 percent of its shots from the floor, including a 4-for-7 effect from 3-point range. The team nearly matched the R/F Facility record of 63 percent from the floor. The Wolves, who didn't miss a free throw until late in the game, were 12-for-15 from the line.

Northern coach Curt Fredrickson said the high shooting percentage on Saturday makes up for a few years of struggles.

"If you take that shooting percentage and divide it by three, that's about what we've shot the last three times here," he said. "So this gym owed us one."

Northern led from start to finish was a Miranda Ristau layup 10 seconds into the game began the scoring. Ristau finished with 12 points, despite playing just 18 minutes.

Jill Conrad finished with her fourth double-double of the season. She missed just one shot in the game to finish with a team-high 16 points to go along with 10 assists. As a team Northern had a season-high 23 assists.

Fredrickson said Conrad is a great weapon against a zone defense.

"Jill Conrad against the zone is the best forward in the league at the free-throw line," Fredrickson said. "I don't know that there is anybody better. That is what makes things go for us against the zone defense. You put Conrad at the free-throw line and now that forces somebody to guard her."

That movement leaves Ristau at the low post with just one defender to beat. The simple play opened up a few baskets for the Northern center.

Fredrickson said the Mustang defense was also confused by some of the cuts made by Northern players.

"We got a lot of easy baskets, particularly in the first half of this game," he said. "But we can't play any better. We shot the eyes out of it (Saturday). We were up against the zone defense all night and only shot seven 3s."

With a large lead most of the game, the Wolves rotated players frequently. All 12 players saw at least 9 minutes on the court. Eleven of them scored. Brianna Kusler, the only Northern player not to score, made up for it with a team-high seven rebounds.

"Everybody got a nice chance to play," Fredrickson said. "Jaycie Gerding came in a popped a couple in just like nothing. That was good to see. Brianna didn't get a lot of shots out front. Gabby (Laimer) got a couple 3s, but they ran things pretty well and took care of the basketball."

Northern used a 12-0 run in the middle of the first quarter to grow an 8-5 lead to 20-5 over a 5 minute period.

Midway through the second quarter, Gerding would give the Wolves a 42-20 lead when she hit a 3-pointer. The 20-point margin would remain through the first half with the Wolves up 52-24 at the break.

Southwest Minnesota played its best quarter in the third and was able to cut the lead to as few as 27 points, but it was never really a game in the second half.

Up next for Northern State is a two-weekend homestand. The Wolves will first host Upper Iowa and Winona State. Friday's game will tip off at 6 p.m. with a 4 p.m. started planned for Saturday.

"Hopefully this game gives us some good momentum heading into next weekend," Fredrickson said. "Those are two big games for us next weekend. We've won four in a row now  two at home and two on the road."
