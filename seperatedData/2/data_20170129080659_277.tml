<TITLE>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Hands-on Preview (Nintendo Switch)</TITLE>
<TEXT>
TABLETOP MODE CHANGES EVERYTHING IN MARIO KART 8 DELUXE.  

 
I guess, for the most part, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the same game that released on the Wii U . The biggest takeaway from playing this as the Switch event was the fact we were able to play split-screen on the Nintendo Switch in tabletop mode and boy does this change everything. The fact that you can literally take this game with you on your Switch tablet and play two-player split-screen with a single Joy-con each is a game changer. I never took my Wii U anywhere and whilst I ways took my 3DS with me, it was only really a single-player machine and theres where the Nintendo Switch will hopefully bring back co-op gameplay. 
 

 
I dont hate the inclusion of being able to carry two items but I dont think it was entirely necessary either. The courses arent really long enough to the point that you need to be holding two items at any given time in my opinion. 
 
I had the chance to play the new battle mode. More specifically, the new balloon fight on the Splatoon course. It felt much more closer to the more traditional battle mode that Ive always loved about Mario Kart. Not quite what it was on the Nintendo 64, but its definitely a ton of fun, and its set to get a lot more play time with the aforementioned tabletop play. 
 
 
Little needs said regarding Mario Kart 8 Deluxe; its more or less the same Mario Kart Wii U owners are already familiar with, albeit with a few more bells and whistles. This, of course means it is still fantastic and made better with the inclusion of all the DLC, the return of Battle Mode and the ability to carry two items. 
 

 
The versatility of the Switch really shines with Mario Kart. Playing on the big screen, in TV Mode, of course looks fantastic, but even sat at a table, you and your friend looking at the Switchs screen, each armed with a Joy-Con each, the game still looks and feels incredible. The social nature of the Switch really shines here, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe will likely be an essential game to have in any Switch owners collection. 
  
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe will release exclusively on Nintendo Switch on April 28th.
