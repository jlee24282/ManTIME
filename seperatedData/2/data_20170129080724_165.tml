NEW MARTINSVILLE  A Paden City woman has been charged with attempted murder after she allegedly stabbed her husband, Wetzel County Prosecutor Tim Haught said. 
  
Paden City Police said Hannah Page Thomas, 26, was arrested after allegedly stabbing Tim Lohri around 9 a.m. Saturday in the north end of Paden City. Lohri was flown via medical helicopter to Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown. 
 
A hospital spokesman said Saturday that Lohri was in critical condition. 
 
We are closely monitoring his progress, Haught said. 
 
Haught and city officials said the incident appears to be domestic in nature and there is no danger to the public. 
 
I would like to thank law enforcement for their prompt and efficient response, Haught said. 
 
Thomas was arraigned Saturday in Wetzel County and taken to Northern Regional Jail.
