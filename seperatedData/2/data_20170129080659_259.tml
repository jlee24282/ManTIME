You all are a,buzz kill.. you don't have to eat the whole pan.. geeze. . Worse things in life to complain about than a piece of candy 
     
While that Carmel is still hot put down a brownie with ice cream drizzle this on top with a smaller drizzle of chocolate then add whipping cream. Set the rest for later.
