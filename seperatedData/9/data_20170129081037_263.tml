<TITLE>At 72, Little Jake is still singing sweet soul music</TITLE>
<TEXT>
GAINESVILLE - Little Jake Mitchell figures he has about 100 suits back at his house, including a couple that come complete with matching capes. Thats fitting for a man sometimes known as Mr. Excitement, and its a sign of respect, he says, for whats driven him for most of his 70-plus years on Earth. Singing.

Singing since he was 5, when as a boy he regularly won talent shows sponsored by the Holsum Bread Company, which paid in bread. That came in handy at home in the Tampa projects.

Singing at 12 years old, recording at Chess Records in Chicago, far from home.

Singing at age 15, with his high-school buddies, in front of many thousands at the University of Florida, headlining the 1960 Gator Growl homecoming. That was a moment of history: Little Jake and the Blenders that day became the first black performers at the event, two years before the first black undergraduates were admitted to the university.

Singing soul music through the 1960s in the black clubs known as the chitlin circuit, and singing up in Detroit, where he cut a song called Not a Chance in a Million, 2:30 minutes of sublime, horn-driven soul. Singing that song, and others, in 2015, at a soul festival in England, where longtime fans from across Europe came to hear him. Still singing, in 2017, at 72 years old.

Next stop: Feb. 4 at Mudville Music Room in Jacksonville, just miles away from the black clubs he used to play, places like Manuels Tap Room and the 2 Spot, which became the Palms Ballroom. All gone now.

On a recent Thursday, his band, Little Jake and the Soul Searchers, crammed all eight members into a small studio near downtown Gainesville for its regular practice. Before the first song  a rip-roarer called Cheaper to Keep Her  Mitchell just smiles when asked if hes lost a step.

I dont think Ive lost anything, he says. I think Ive got an increase.

Indeed: Compare his decades-old version of Not a Chance in Million, found on Youtube, with the way he belts it out now, and its clear hes still got it.

Hes the real deal, says Delorean Fullington, an accomplished bass player finishing up a masters degree in music performance at UF. He popped into the studio soon after the Soul Searchers rehearsal started, just because he likes the band, and was soon smiling and applauding.

They dont do this anymore, Fullington says. People just dont sing like this anymore.

Adrian Croasdell is promoter of the Cleethorpes Northern Soul Weekender festival in England, a gathering of lovers of mid-1960s American soul music. He hired Mitchell for the 2015 event, and said fans came from Spain, Germany, France and Italy.

By email, Croasdell said Mitchell is well-remembered by English soul fans, largely by the stage name  Jock Mitchell  that he performed under for a while.

His record Not a Chance in a Million on Impact Records out of Detroit in 1967 is considered one of the best examples of the music us British soul fans love, Croasdell said. It is a great dance record for our music scene, (and) gets regular play at discotheques all over the country where rare 60s and 70s soul music is played.

Mitchell made many records, and ran his own record company, Golden Hit Productions, in Detroit. He had a couple of nightclubs there. Yet the music industry is tough. Its grinding.

In the mid-70s, he left music and and followed his other love, cooking. He was chef for 13 years at University of Bridgeport in Connecticut, making a regular living to support his children.

He was happy enough doing that, he says. But he sang all the time as he cooked. And he kept this in mind: I knew I was going to put the knife down and make music again.

Everybody was happy

Little Jakes discovery story goes like this:

He was born in Tampa in 1944 and named Arnold Rodriguez; his mother, Thelma, was a Cuban-American and changed his last name to Mitchell when she later married (an aunt nicknamed him Jake, which stuck).

He was always singing, and he was singing while hanging out at Sweetwater Poultry Market when the business owner, Henry Urso, called on the telephone to check in. Columbus Warren, who ran the place, picked up the phone.

Whos that singing? Urso asked. Why, thats Miss Thelmas son, Jake, Warren said. Hold him until I get there, Urso said.

Within hours Urso signed on to manage Little Jakes career, and took him to downtown Tampa to buy his first suit, a red one.

While he was still 12, Jake spent time at legendary Chess Records  home to Chuck Berry, among others  recording tracks. A management dispute messed that up, but soon young Jake was spending summers on a bus, barnstorming with other musicians from performance to performance across the South, Northeast and Midwest.

For high school, he moved to Gainesville and formed Little Jake and the Blenders: Four boys from the choir at all-black Lincoln High singing backup, with Jake on lead vocals. Soon they were busy every Friday and Saturday night of the school year singing at sweaty fraternity parties and fancy sorority gatherings at UF, backed by a band of white college students called the Pyramids.

It had certain advantages. Girls liked them. And the money was good, for teenagers. Teachers, paid next to nothing, even hit them up for loans.

The college kids, who were all white, loved the band, and asked Jake to headline Gator Growl in 1960. He said he would, as long as blacks were allowed in for the performance.

To have that much chutzpah, to do that, at that age? says Charles Steadham, 72, saxophone player and band leader of the Soul Searchers, and one of the few white musicians who played on the chitlin circuit.

The university agreed, and 10,000 bleacher seats were set up for blacks in the south end zone of Florida Field. And after entertainment such as Wish Upon a Genie by Kappa Delta and selections from Annie Get Your Gun, Little Jake and the Blenders took the stage.

By that point, music lovers werent staying in those south end zone bleachers, Jake recalls, and nobody seemed to mind. People started sitting everywhere, he said. Everybody was happy.

Fifty years later, a few years after Mitchell moved back home to Gainesville, the city proclaimed May 6, 2010 as Little Jake Day, marking the events of that Gator Growl.

Hes proud of the part he played in that. But he figures that music is what really made it happen: Music is something that can bring people together, he likes to say, and it probably had a big impact on what would follow in the decades to come.

He saw that as he toured with B.B. King and Marvin Gaye and countless others, well-known and obscure, as music began to break down barriers that had stood for a long time.

White people wanted to hear our music. They wanted to dance to our music. They wanted to see entertainers. The next thing you know, black and white are singing together, recording together, doing shows together, Little Jake says. You see? It was destined to happen.
