<TITLE>Sunday's letters: Facing our own hypocrisy</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We must provide homes and meet the other needs of orphans in our communities. 
 
I have been thinking and praying about the issue of abortion a lot lately. I believe if you are pro-life you have to also be pro-child and pro-mother. As Christians, we are facing our own hypocrisy if you look at the staggering numbers of children in foster care, orphanages and in need of loving families. 
 
If we spread the call to stop abortions, we need to step up to provide homes and meet the physical, spiritual, academic and social needs of the orphans in our communities. In my heart, I dont believe we can have it both ways. 
 
What if we step up now and love the orphans who are already here until there isnt a child or a mother in need who went without? Would we need to fight so hard to end abortion if loving families were willing and ready with hands outstretched for children in need? 
 
Instead of condemnation, what if we provide compassion? Instead of judgment, what if we provide just what a mother who couldnt care for her child needed  a family? 
 
If you claim to be religious but dont control what you say and do, you are fooling yourself, and your religion is worthless. Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress. (James 1:26-27.)

Real America is everywhere 
 
A letter in last Sundays newspaper showed divisiveness at its worst. To claim that the difference in the popular vote between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is irrelevant because the majority came from big cities is akin to saying that a family living on a farm in the country is more American than a family living in a tiny apartment in the city. 
 
I worked in midtown Manhattan for almost 35 years, and on any given day I encountered panhandlers and billionaires; fundamentalist Christians, orthodox Jews and atheists; people whose ancestors were pioneers and those who had just been sworn in as citizens that morning. If you understand the original motto of the United States  e pluribus unum (out of many, one)  or if you imagine this country as a giant mosaic with each person being part of the design, then the real America is everywhere. 
 
I believe a majority of New Yorkers voted against Trump because many knew someone who wasnt paid for his work, had been cheated or sued by him or had been offended by his insults. During the primaries, New Yorkers heard Trump lie about celebrations that occurred on 9/11, brag about his sexual prowess, proudly show off the five children hes had with three different women, and denigrate Mexicans, black people and Muslims, and they felt he was not the person they wanted to represent them. 
 
If the 25.5 percent of eligible voters who elected him disagree, that is their prerogative, but to think of themselves as mainstream is delusional.

Just a national hissy fit 
 
To all the local women who went to Washington for the Womens March, please explain to the area citizens what you are proud of. 
 
Is it your keynote speakers Ashley Judd making despicable remarks or Madonna wanting to blow up the White House or her uncalled-for profanity on live television? 
 
This appears to be nothing more than a national hissy fit to many of us. Please explain.

No to Article V Convention 
 
Twenty-eight states to date have filed for a Balanced Budget Amendment Constitution Article V Convention. It takes 34 states to make that happen. I am opposed to an Article V Convention for the following reasons: 
 
1. The Constitution is not the problem. It is not necessary to amend it in order to balance the budget. The House of Representatives has the authority and responsibility to do so. For some time, we have seen that it lacks the resolve to do so. 
 
2. An Article V Convention would not be obliged to limit its function to a single issue. 
 
3. An Article V Convention would enable powerful special interests to revise the Constitution in their favor or effectively eliminate it. The most damming act would be to remove Article V, which would remove a peaceful path to resolution in the future. 
 
4. I oppose an Article V Convention because it could be used to legitimize and extend overreach by federal bureaucrats. This serves to move our nation away from its founding as a constitutional republic (rule of law) and toward being a democracy (rule of men). In the republic, even when your party is not in the majority, the laws protect your rights. In the democracy, the majority rules, and it may take your freedoms as well as your property and rights. How hard is that to figure out?

Democrats flimsy excuse 
 
The Russians stole Hillary Clintons crown is the best excuse Democrats have? For crying out loud, my generation had more creativity than that! 
 
At least we whined, The Martians stole my term paper or The aliens did it. Most people didnt believe those, either, but if youre going to make up excuses for your mistakes and losses, use a little imagination. 
 
Sheesh. The Russians?
