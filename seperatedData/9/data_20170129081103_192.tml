<TITLE>Letter: Downtown Chico's water tank looks fine as it is</TITLE>
<TEXT>
I respectfully disagree with letter writer David D. Bruhn, in the Jan. 23 letters to the editor. He suggests putting a message up on the water tank in Chico, in honor of the Pleasant Valley High School football team. I congratulate the PV football team for its wonderful accomplishment. But I dont want to see more symbols and messages around town. 
 
That water tank, to me, is an icon. PV is not the only high school in town. Im not partial to any school. But I just dont think painting a message on the tower is a good idea. 
 
Why does everything have to have something written or painted on it? There are too many advertisement signs, not to mention the unwanted graffiti, as it is. Please, leave the tank plain. It looks best that way. 
 
 Lori Eckhart, Chico
