<TITLE>Cast aside media images; feel good about yourself</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The rise of eating disorders among Americans is increasing rapidly. With more than 20 million women and 10 million men suffering with eating disorders at one point in their life, this is a major issue in society that needs to be discussed. 
 
Eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia can cause many serious medical issues, such as muscle loss and osteoporosis, as well as mental health issues like depression and anxiety. 
 
Even kids as young as elementary school are worried about their weight, and how they are perceived by others, and that should not be what these young people are worrying about. This situation is causing mental illness to occur in younger and younger children every year, and increasing the amount of issues related to eating disorders. 
 
What is to blame for these unhealthy body images? Many believe that the media could be to blame. 
 
Looking at the photoshopped models on the covers of magazines, or seeing the celebrities who look almost unrecognizable due to the amount of plastic surgery they have had done could be causing young people to think they must change things about themselves to fit into what they see all around them. 
 
Throughout the years, the definition of beauty has changed dramatically. In the 1950s, a woman was considered to be the epitome of beauty if she was curvy with an hourglass figure and looked absolutely perfect from head to toe every time she left the house. 
 
Todays standard of beauty has changed dramatically. Todays idea of beauty is to be muscular and toned, and have flawless teeth and skin. 
 
But for many people, it is impossible to change such physical things about themselves. People with acne, for instance, may struggle for years trying to get rid of it, but may be stuck with it for the rest of their lives. 
 
There is not much representation of people with different body types in the media. Many actors and actresses are put on a pedestal, and are held to very high standards. This leads to the unhealthy thought that everyone is the same, but thats just not possible. 
 
Genetics and different ethnicities give people different body types, which can lead to some folks hurting themselves to look like someone who they just cant look like. Many beauty product commercials shame both men and women, pointing out flaws and encouraging them to buy their product so they can be considered normal. 
 
While there is a lot of pressure put on women about appearance, such as having long beautiful hair, long legs and perfect skin, the media does not just affect women. Men are also affected by the medias representation of what men should look like. Men are expected to have perfect hair, rippling muscles and tan skin. If men are affected by eating disorders and mental illness, they are told to man up because they should be strong and not show any weakness. 
 
One way to help future generations accept themselves for who they are is to provide more representation of different types of people, from all different types of backgrounds in the media. 
 
If there is a plus-sized model on the cover of a magazine, or there are people of color acting more in major films, future generations will see that there is nothing to be ashamed of, and that we should support everyones differences. 
 
Maybe then, if we learn to accept everyone for who they are, body image issues will be a thing of the past, and people will not feel the need to change the things they have no control over. 
 
And maybe women and men can finally feel comfortable in their own skin.
