The Thunderbolts were back at Ford Center Saturday night for Star Wars night and were able to snap their five-game losing streak with a 2-1 win over the Peoria Rivermen. 
 
The Rivermen got on the board in the first period. Evansville then tied things up in the second, before taking the 2-1 lead in the final period. 
 
The Thunderbolts will be back on the road this week as they head to Fayetteville on Friday.
