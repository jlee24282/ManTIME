<TITLE>WWE: Last minute updates from the Royal Rumble PPV 2017</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Texas, Jan 29: We are almost there for the 30th annual Royal Rumble event set to take place at the historic Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas. 
 
30 men will compete inside the ring to headline Wrestlemania on April 2nd, 2017.

As of the latest reports, WWE might be very concerned about the ticket-selling of the event. The Alamodome has the capacity where 65000 plus crowd cane witnesses the live event. 
 
However, despite the biggest names on the card, the center has sold out only 40000 plus tickets, so far. WWE can only hope that the last minute selling might help them to sell out the entire arena.

The main event of the night will obviously be the prestigious battle royal to decide who will go on to main event Wrestlemania. So far, these are the names which are already confirmed to appear in the match. 
 
List of 30 wrestlers: 
 
The Undertaker 
 
Goldberg 
 
Brock Lesnar 
 
Big Show 
 
Dean Ambrose 
 
The Miz 
 
Sami Zayn 
 
Dolph Ziggler 
 
Big E 
 
Xavier Woods 
 
Kofi Kingston 
 
Bray Wyatt 
 
Randy Orton 
 
Luke Harper 
 
Mojo Rawley 
 
Braun Strowman 
 
Chris Jericho 
 
Baron Corbin 
 
Cesaro 
 
Sheamus 
 
Big Cass 
 
Rusev 
 
Defeating all the favorites to win the match, the betting odds are highly favoring the name of Braun Strowman who might emerge as the one to be the last standing in the ring. 
 
He has been getting a major push during the pre-Rumble season and even bigger plans are kept for him for the Wrestlemania season. 
 
Plus, Randy Orton has suddenly become another favorite to win the Rumble match, out of nowhere. He might face Bray Wyatt for the WWE championship at Wrestlemania after the Eater of the World wins the WWE championship at the Elimination Chamber PPV.

As for the surprise entrants, Rey Mysterios name has suddenly joined the grapevine since he is done with his deal with Lucha Underground and could be well on his way to WWE. 
 
Also, the earlier announced six-woman tag team contest featuring Nikki Bella, Becky Lynch, Naomi, Natalya, Mickie James and the champion Alexa Bliss has now moved on to the kick-off show. Previously, this match was announced as part of the main show.
