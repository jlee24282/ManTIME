Derby County will be in the hat for the fifth round of the FA Cup after a draw with Premier League champions Leicester City. 
 
The Rams drew 2-2 with the Foxes but had, until the 87th minute, led at Pride Park Stadium. Wes Morgan headed home a late leveller to set up a replay at the King Power Stadium on Wednesday, February 8 (7.45pm). 
 
Darren Bent had earlier scored at both ends before Craig Bryson put Steve McClaren's men ahead.
