<TITLE>Bonus Points Lift Carolina Past No. 24 Pitt</TITLE>
<TEXT>
PITTSBURGH --- The North Carolina wrestling team got bonus-point wins from Nicholas Lirette, Ethan Ramos and Joey Ward to score a 20-17 win over No. 24 Pitt Saturday night at Fitzgerald Field House. Ramos tallied his fifth pin of the year to help seal the victory that pushed Carolina to 6-5 and 1-2 in the ACC. Pitt fell to 8-4 and 0-2 in league competition. 
 
Lirette's first career major decision at 133 pounds gave Carolina its first lead of the night. The Boutte, Louisiana, freshman beat Brendan Price in a high-scoring bout, 21-9, to put the Tar Heels up 4-3. Ward then made it back-to-back majors at 141 as he dominated Robert Lee 10-1. 
 
Troy Heilmann won a battle of veterans at 149 pounds with a 10-7 decision over Mikey Racciato before Pitt won back-to-back bouts to get back into the dual. 
 
With Carolina clinging to an 11-10 overall lead, Ramos restored a comfortable lead with a second-period pin of Cam Jacobson at 174. The Hawthorne, New Jersey, All-American was already up 11-0 when he stuck Jacobson to give the Tar Heels a 17-10 advantage. 
 
At 197, Danny Chaid sealed the dual with a 10-4 victory over John Rizzo. Chaid took a 3-0 lead into the final period and pulled away in the last two minutes to give UNC its first ACC win of the season. 
 
Carolina returns home on Saturday, Feb. 4, to host Virginia at 7 p.m.
