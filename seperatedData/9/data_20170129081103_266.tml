SUPPLIES

One 30 x 44 inch glass picture frame from Goodwill only 24.99

2 cans of looking glass spray paint by Krylon

1 container black acrylic paint

1 container crackle medium

1 container ivory paint

printer paper

Print life-sized photos of Victorian kids in black and white (eyes blacked out with stamp tool and old photo/film effect to look crackled) 

Cut them out, glue with mod podge glue them to glass.

Wet your fingers and rub some of the paper away from the ink along the edges to soften the cut-out effect and allow some mirror paint to show through.

Spray the back of the glass (back of the pictures too) with looking glass paint. Don't worry about making it too perfectly even because you can create an aged glass look out of imperfections. If you want it to look more like an old mirror, spray some water on it before spraying with mirror paint to make bubbles.

Paint picture frame black. Let dry. 

Utilizing the Black-Eyed Children theme, consider making some in your window looking out at Trick-Or-Treaters. 

Print the children out above in life-sized dimensions. Glue to cardboard. Cut out head and shoulders outline. Cut out entire eye shape. Tape black paper behind the eyes. Put in front window of house. On Halloween night, place a spot light or glow sticks outside the window to show them off.
