<TITLE>Chris Kelly: Scranton soaked again?</TITLE>
<TEXT>
So far, the official story of the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority doesnt hold water. Sold as a debt-cleansing wellspring of revitalization, the deal increasingly resembles a rising tide that will lift a few select ships but drown the villagers caught in its undertow. About the only aspect of the sale of Scrantons last major asset that happened as advertised was the sale price, and even that came with a caveat. Pennsylvania American Water Co. paid $195 million for the sewer system and all its assets  which included $38 million in authority cash. At the Dec. 29 closing, the authority didnt have that much on hand, so $12 million of the sale proceeds went to pay the difference. Mayor Bill Courtright revealed this at the closing, but it remains unclear when he became aware of the situation, which contributed to the city receiving $30 million less than the $96 million Mr. Courtright promised. I dont see how he could keep saying, Everythings fine, were still getting the same amount, Councilman Bill Gaughan said Friday. We would ask, and he would say there was nothing to worry about. After speaking with Mr. Gaughan, I asked the mayor what he knew and when. It was a very complicated deal that was changing on a weekly basis, he said. Mr. Courtright acknowledged that he was aware of the issue prior to the closing, but I couldnt give you an exact date. I dont know how to answer that for you. Council was caught flatfooted when the citys share of the sale shrunk to about $70 million. About $17 million was placed in escrow  $12 million of which was set aside to address a lawsuit by Green Ridge residents who were surprised to learn that sewer lines snake beneath their properties and understandably rejected offers of $100 for easements. The best-case payout for the city is now $83 million, but there are no guarantees, and still no plan to deal with stormwater management costs. The authority once took care of stormwater management, but that job will now fall to Scranton and Dunmore. Taxpayers stand to get soaked, essentially paying two sewer fees  one to a corporation and another to the governments that pushed ahead with the sale with no plan for its aftermath. Mr. Courtright said the city and authority are exploring solutions to the stormwater challenge, which he hopes will not be as costly as many predict. Time will tell, but whatever the costs, they will be a further drain on the value of the sale. Drip, drip, drip ... Also unknown to the public is the cost of attorney and consultant fees related to the sale, and who has been or will be paid. Rumors of huge payouts have been circulating for weeks. On Jan. 10, council sent a letter to William Conaboy Jr. of Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney, a law firm representing the authority in the sale. Among other items, it asks for a breakdown of how the $12 million in surplus cash was spent and an accounting of legal and consulting fees. It seems like this information should be readily available, Mr. Gaughan said. I dont know why we still dont have it. The Times-Tribune has filed Right to Know requests with the city and authority on these and other issues surrounding the sale. One recipient is the new executive director of the sewer authority, Jason Shrive. He left his post as Mr. Courtrights solicitor for the new $130,000-a-year gig, which includes the authority solicitor job. In fact, Mr. Shrive is the only employee of the authority. He succeeds former Executive Director Eugene Barrett, who, after the closing, went to work for Pennsylvania American Water Co. Yep. This whole thing stinks, Mr. Gaughan said at Thursdays council meeting. This arrangement is similar to the fox guarding the henhouse. He called Mr. Shrives appointment a blatant cash grab paid for by the (sewer) ratepayers of this city. Not so, Mr. Shrive told me, dismissing the councilmans comments as election-year grandstanding. He said hes a good fit for the position because of his involvement in the sale. Aside from his salary, he said he has not been and will not be paid for his work on the sale. Mr. Courtright confirmed this, and both assured that all costs will eventually be accounted for and made public. In the meantime, Mr. Courtright said the sale was a good deal for the city and that critics should have proposed alternatives during the process, not after. We had to do something, he said. I dont remember anyone giving me a better idea. My question to them is, What would have happened if we did nothing? CHRIS KELLY is The Times-Tribune columnist.
