<TITLE>Late 3 lifts No. 10 UCO past MSSU women</TITLE>
<TEXT>
After struggling to score in the first eight minutes of the fourth quarter, both Missouri Southern and Central Oklahoma made big shots down the stretch. 
 
And the Bronchos made the last  and biggest  one. 
 
Marley Anderson hit a 3-pointer with 3.4 seconds to play to lift No. 10 Central Oklahoma past Missouri Southern 61-60, stunning a crowd of 1,482 at the Leggett & Platt Athletic Center on Robert Corn Court. 
 
The Lions (11-10, 6-6 MIAA) and Bronchos (19-1, 10-1) were tied 46-46 after three quarters, and the teams combined for two points  two charities by UCO's Melinda Murillo  in the first 5:12 of the final stanza. But 3-pointers by Deb Holcomb from the left baseline and Jasmine Green from the right corner, and Holcomb's driving layup gave the Lions a 54-52 lead with 1:40 left. 
 
The Bronchos tied the game on Anderson's two free throws with 54 seconds remaining, and UCO's defense then kept the Lions from getting a good look at the basket. But just before the shot clock expired, Holcomb launched a shot from about 28 feet on the right side, and the ball banked off the glass and directly into the basket for a three-point lead with 24.1 seconds left. 
 
"I knew the shot clock was going down," Holcomb said. "Really I just wanted to hit the rim to give us a chance to get the rebound. I heard Coach saying 'step back, do the step back,' and I was thinking to myself I'm already I feel like 40 feet off the line. I shot it, and it went in." 
 
Murillo made two more free throws to make it a one-point game with 24 seconds left, and it took the Bronchos 13 seconds to commit four fouls and put the Lions at the foul line where Henry made both charities for a 59-56 lead with 11.5 seconds to play. 
 
The Bronchos' Olivia Mason had the ball on the left side and wanted to shoot a 3, but the ball was touched and wound up in the hands of Jesheon Cooper, who turned and made a shot from the foul line with 6 seconds left. 
 
Henry was fouled again  winding up on the floor in front of the MSSU bench. This time she missed the first free throw but made the second for a 60-58 lead with 5.4 on the clock. 
 
"You have to make sure you don't get rattled, especially when you get thrown into the bench and have to shoot a free throw," Henry said. "You work on free throws every day in the gym. I shoot about 100 a day. ... If I could go back, I would have taken more time on that first shot because my head was kind of hurting after being thrown into the bench. Free throws are repetition, and I'm confident in myself at the free-throw line." 
 
UCO advanced the ball to the front court with a timeout. From the sideline Blake Blessington threw the ball inbounds to Anderson on the left side, and she pivoted and hit a 3-pointer  her only 3-point shot of the game  with 3.4 to play. 
 
"We were going to shoot a 3 for the win because we'd been struggling all day," UCO coach Guy Hardaker said. "They guarded us like nobody has guarded us all year. And if we can't get a clean look, throw it inside and we'll try to play for overtime." 
 
The Lions went to a zone defense on the possession. 
 
"We felt we can guard the 3 a little better," Ressel said, "because some of their screening action, they'll pop out Mason and she's a great shooter. If she pops, it's hard for us to recover back. We had a miscue that we didn't recover back and check the shot. 
 
"Those things are going to happen. I told the kids there are 500 things that I will think about tonight I could have done a lot different that may have changed the outcome of the game. I told them to keep their heads up. I'm proud of them because they played so hard." 
 
On the Lions' final possession, Jenson Maydew's pass for Desirea Buerge at midcourt was high, and the Bronchos grabbed the ball and dribbled out the clock. 
 
Henry and Holcomb finished with 16 points apiece for the Lions, and Buerge and Maydew both contributed 11. Buerge, battling against Cooper on the inside, came up with five steals, and Maydew snagged nine rebounds as the Lions outrebounded the bigger Bronchos 37-34. 
 
Mason scored 15 for UCO, including 11 in a five-minute stretch in the second quarter. Cooper had 14 points, nine rebounds and three blocks, and Murillo added 13.
