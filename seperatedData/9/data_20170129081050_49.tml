<TITLE>Bravo! Sushant Singh removes Rajput from his surname in support of Sanjay Leela Bhansali</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Sanjay Leela Bhansali was attacked by Rajputs Karni Sena two days ago in Rajasthan on the sets of Padmavati . The entire Bollywood is shocked with the entire incident and everyone is supporting the filmmaker and wants strict action to take against the culprits. Actor Sushant Singh Rajput went to a whole new level to show his support to SLB. The actor removed Rajput from his surname which is a HUGE step and we hope it will be an eye opener. The actor changed his name to Sushant and wrote on twitter, We would suffer till the time were obsessed with our surnames. If youre that courageous, give us your first name to acknowledge.#padmavati. Followed by another tweet, There is no religion or cast bigger than humanity and Love & compassion makes us human. Any other division is done for selfish gains. Kudos to Sushant!

Bhansali was attacked by the Karni Sena coz they misunderstood that there is a romantic dream sequence shot between Alauddin Khilji ( Ranveer Singh ) And Padmavati ( Deepika Padukone ). However the filmmaker released an official statement where he claimed there is NO such scene being shot between Ranveer and Deepika. 
 
Sanjay Leela Bhansali has shot two films in Jaipur and despite his love for Rajasthan, for the safety of his crew, we have decided to leave the city post the shocking incident where miscreants damaged property and misbehaved with the crew on the shoot of Padmavati, SLB had directed the opera Padmavati to packed houses in Paris and earned worldwide praise for it. He was inspired by the beautiful and courageous queen and is making a feature film on the story. We clarify that there is no dream sequence or any objectionable scene between Rani Padmavati and Allauddin Khilji. We have been carefully researching and making the film The attack on the shoot and crew was uncalled for and was extremely damaging to the image of the beautiful city of Jaipur, the statement added. We are confident that Mewar will be proud of the film made on their revered queen. We do not want to hurt any sentiments and would appreciate if the local people support us in making this film and making their queen revered by the world. 
 
Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone and Shahid Kapoor too appalled the incident with the series of tweets.. 
  
As a team, we are making Padmavati keeping in mind the sensitivities and emotions of the people of Rajasthan and the Rajput community.

Sanjay Sir is one of the most accomplished & authentic filmmakers we have in India, & he wont ever do anything to hurt anyones feelings.

Very very sad. Words do fall short and feel too little to express feelings. Violence is unacceptable. This incident has shocked me.

Sanjay bhansali is a film maker who the country should be proud of. You will know when u see #padmavati the dignity he brings to it.
