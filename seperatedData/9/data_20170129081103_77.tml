<TITLE>Rams football team honored as a top national team</TITLE>
<TEXT>
This wasnt your typical high school pep rally, to be sure. 
   
Thursday afternoons assembly in the Rio Rancho High School gym featured the pep band, games, introductions of the student-athletes on the winter sports teams, recognition of some successful fall sports teams  and national recognition of the most-successful team in the city last fall. 
   
That would be the Class 6A state champion football team, which ran the table -- going 13-0 for the second time in three seasons  and finished at No. 68. That announcement was recently made by MaxPreps, the online high school sports leader and a CBSSports.com site. 
   
Thus, cameras were rolling from two Albuquerque television stations, along with the local newspaper, for this unique celebration. 
   
How unique? Of more than 17,000 high schools in the United States that field varsity football teams, only 50 were being recognized on the 2016-17 MaxPreps Tour of Champions. 
   
MaxPreps computer rankings were used to determine team ranks for its Tour of Champions. The system utilizes the huge number of game results stored in the MaxPreps database. Generally, the more a team wins the higher the ranking, but the system takes into account quality wins (against other highly ranked opponents), margin of victory and strength of schedule. Playoff games are weighted 2.1 times a regular-season game. 
   
MaxPreps and Army National Guard representatives were in the RAC Thursday to generate excitement, awareness and present the Rams with the official National Guard national ranking trophy as part of a tribute to their remarkable season. 
   
Rio Rancho completed a perfect 13-0 season  dubbed the Revenge Tour  after routing visiting Las Cruces, 39-17, on Dec. 3 to claim the New Mexico 6A state championship. The Rams were also 13-0 in 2014 when they grabbed their first state title. 
   
New Mexico Army National Guard Sergeant Christina Griego presented Howes and the team with the ANG ranking trophy during the pep rally, and the team also received a banner for its accomplishment. 
   
"Each fall, over 16,000 varsity football teams take the field in hopes of being champions. The MaxPreps Tour of Champions and the Army National Guard honor the most outstanding teams in the nation for their state championship performance and elite national level ranking." said Andy Beal, president and founder of MaxPreps. "Congratulations to the Rio Rancho Rams players, coaches and fans for an amazing year and for earning the Army National Guard's national rankings trophy." 
   
Howes will also be honored by the New Mexico Sports Hall of Fame at its annual banquet on April 9 as its high school coach of the year. 
   
The Rams kick off the 2017 season on Friday, Aug. 25, when Mayfield visits Rio Rancho Stadium.
