Lying, cheating, lust, envy. Sin takes different forms, but it can all be traced back to one, common cause- the rejection of Christs kingship. On The Bible Study Hour, well study Psalm chapter 2 - a complex passage with a mysterious purpose. Join us as Dr. Boice explains how we each have an important role to play in proclaiming Christ as King.

About The Bible Study Hour 

This program offers careful, in-depth Bible study, teaching you how to think and act biblically. 

About Dr. James Boice 

Dr. James Montgomery Boice, speaker on The Bible Study Hour radio broadcast since 1969, served as Senior Minister of Philadelphia's historic Tenth Presbyterian Church from 1968 until his death in 2000. The broadcast continues to air his messages, starting in 1969. 

Under Dr. Boice, Tenth Presbyterian Church became a model for evangelical ministry in America's cities. He also gave leadership to groups beyond his own church and organization, including the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy and Bible Study Fellowship. 

He also founded and chaired an annual lay theology conference, Philadelphia Conference on Reformation Theology, which has run continuously for 28 years and has brought in-depth study of major biblical doctrines to thousands of people. 

In 1994 Dr. Boice joined with other evangelical leaders in founding the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals, which in 1996 sponsored a Summit meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts, of more than 100 evangelical leaders. Out of that meeting came "The Cambridge Declaration," a document calling Christians to repent of their cultural worldliness and to recover the great salvation doctrines of the Bible as the Reformers did in the sixteenth century. This organization now produces The Bible Study Hour, Modern Reformation and God's Word Today magazines, and sponsors many conferences and seminars. 

A prolific author, Dr. Boice wrote or contributed to over sixty books on a wide variety of biblical and theological themes. His 4-volume commentary on Romans was named one of the best books of the twentieth century. Other popular titles include Standing on the Rock, The Parables of Jesus, The Christ of Christmas, Christ's Call to Discipleship... 

Dr. Boice held degrees from Harvard University (A.B.), Princeton Theological Seminary (B.D.), the University of Basel, Switzerland (D. Theol.) and the Theological Seminary of the Reformed Episcopal Church (D.D., honorary).
