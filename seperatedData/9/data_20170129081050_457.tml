DENVER, Colo. Facing a ranked team on the road did not stop Colorado State University-Pueblo Women's Basketball's historic win streak. The No.4 ranked ThunderWolves rolled past No. 18-0 Regis University 65-51 to move to 21-0 for the first time in school history. 
 
At 15-0 in Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference games, the Pack now enjoys a three-game lead on every other team in the RMAC. Regis, the Pack's closest competition in the RMAC, plummeted to 11-3 in RMAC games and 16-3 overall. 
 
Molly Rohrer (So., Greenwood Village, Colo.) took over the game in the second half. Rohrer finished with 19 points, 17 of which came after intermission. She made 7-of-15 from the field and 5-of-6 from the line. Rohrer also snagged four rebounds. 
 
Senior Angie Moore (Katy, Texas)carried the Pack's offense in the first half, scoring all 10 of her points before halftime. Moore went 4-of-8 from the field and added five rebounds. 
 
Despite a battle with foul trouble, Katie Cunningham (Aurora, Colo.), the RMAC's leading rebounder secured 10 rebounds. Cunningham scored seven points, going a perfect 3-of-3 from the field. She came away with a steal and a block. 
 
Junior Tuileisu Anderson (Vancouver, Wash.) tacked on 11 points on 4-of-10 shooting. Anderson also collected four rebounds. 
 
Jaszymn Johnson (Denver, Colo.) drained three 3-pointers. She finished with nine points. Defensively, Johnson came away with five rebounds and a block. Sophomore Lauren Heyn (Loomis, Calif.) led the Pack with two blocks. 
 
CSU-Pueblo held a decisive advantage shooting the ball. The Pack made 42.1 percent compared to just 24.6 percent shooting from the Rangers. Not only did the Pack's defense limit Regis to 24.6 from the field, they also swatted seven Ranger shots. 
 
A see-saw battle early gave the Rangers a 6-4 lead. The Pack quickly erased it with a 7-0 run. Regis would reclaim the lead 16-15. A conventional three-point play from Moore gave the Pack an 18-16 lead after one. 
 
Regis would take its final lead early in the second quarter on a 3-pointer that made it 19-18. CSU-Pueblo answered with a 7-1 run. The Pack led by as many as seven late in the second, but would carry a 32-28 edge into the break. Regis' Mary Sigler scored 22 of her team's 28 points in the first half. She would finish with 29. 
 
Up 36-32 early in the second half, Rohrer and the Pack took over. CSU-Pueblo went on a 9-0 run to put the Pack up 45-32. Rohrer scored eight of the nine points during this stretch. CSU-Pueblo had a 9-4 run the rest of the way to carry a 52-38 lead into the fourth. Rohrer scored 12 points in the third. 
Though Regis trimmed the Pack lead back to single digits, CSU-Pueblo would pull away with a 6-0 run to make it 60-46. The ThunderWolves would go on to defeat the Rangers 65-51 to reach 21-0. 
 
After beating their second ranked team of the season, the ThunderWolves will return home Friday Feb. 3 to play rival Adams State University at 5:30 p.m.
