<TITLE>Our View: IPIB must be spared from funding cuts</TITLE>
<TEXT>
A proposed budget deal reached by Gov. Terry Branstad  who created the in 2013  and Republican leadership in the Iowa House and Senate would cut the groups funding by $75,000.

Over the course of a year, that figure represents a 21.6 percent cut from the boards annual budget of $348,000. But that cut constitutes more than half of its operating budget through the end of the fiscal year this June.

Such a move would be a disaster for all Iowans.

The IPIB has the power that is almost unique among the states to order compliance with open meetings and open records laws, the board in the vast majority of cases is able to resolve complaints informally, and without either side having to hire a lawyer or go to court.

But anyone who thinks that this is a minor agency that doesnt apply to them couldnt be further from the truth. Its three-person staff processed 875 cases in 2016 alone  a significant increase year over year and many times over more cases than anticipated when the board was formed.

In particular, many bodies in southwest Iowa have kept the board busy in recent years.

The most notable local case the board handled came from the Harrison County Board of Supervisors. Just last month, a state court upheld a lower courts ruling that held its three members personally liable for violating open meeting laws in 2013.

City councils in both Council Bluffs and Pacific Junction have reached mediation agreements with the board in recent years regarding allegations of violations  but the state board goes far beyond that.

Within the last three years, complaints centering around a hospital in Denison, the school board in Red Oak and the public library in Atlantic have all been funneled to the IPIB.

Some were dismissed; others spurred corrective action  but all cases involved the board striving to ensure Iowans had access to transparent, open government and other nonelected bodies.

Now, more than ever, access and transparency are vital cornerstones for democracy. Fake news and alternative facts have entered the lexicon and spread like wildfire online  but truth and openness remain the best weapon to inform and educate the public.

In short, the board meets a vital demand by Iowans  citizens, state and local government officials and members of the news media  for fast and cost-free resolution of questions and complaints about public access to records and meetings of state and local governments.

The people of Iowa have a right to know how their state and local tax dollars are spent and what is being done in their interest by the public officials they elect.

That right to know is a hollow promise without vigorous enforcement of Iowas public meetings and public records laws. But it would in fact be a hollow promise if the Legislature acts to cripple the . Without question, our lawmakers must act to preserve funding for this critical agency.
