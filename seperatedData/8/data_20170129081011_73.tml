The Moon enters creative, emotional Water sign Pisces at 11:10 AM. The vibe is intuitive today: Pisces one of the most psychic signs in the zodiac. Increasing everyone's mental powers, the planet of the mind, Mercury, will meet the lord of underworld, Pluto, in Capricorn at 3:18 PM, which will reveal secrets and help us understand things on an even deeper level. 

All times EST.
