It is time to let go of over-thinking and problem searching said DeRu, To free ourselves from boundaries and self caging is to grow our strength in character, trustworthiness, and responsibilities. That is to be truly free. as he stressed his statement. 
 
Happiness with a health body and a health mind is almost what everyone wishes to possess, as the Zen master clarified, High conscious intelligence, from Healing to Health with Harmony and Happiness penetrates and permeates into all the communities of Zen world, further prevailing into all conscious beings around the globe. 
 
According to DeRu, Zen sees one conscious world, and one conscious being with one breath and one source of origin, from nothing to everything, expanding to apparent visible world as one sees with naked eye. However; the invisible potentiality is unlimited and infinite. The high conscious intelligence continues its path to infinite potentiality to everlasting-limitless universe. 
 
DeRu further explained: "Zen sees the reality of potentiality is in the emptiness within and between the visible worlds. It is that emptiness of potentiality makes the universe going with consistent and constant expanding in infinity." 
 
This is how the Zen Master sees the world, "The high conscious mind of the universe guides and decides the direction of the universe expansion and development. When one follows the heart of the high conscious universe, one believes and achieves ones dream with unwavering faith and confidence. One will eventually be intotal communication and merge with that of infinite oneness." 
 
It is that Zen mind propagates and instigates Imagination which opens the 3rd eye to vision the infinite Potentiality of the true reality of the universe." according to DeRu. We are all part of, and microcosm of the universe. Our body particles are universal participles and our atoms are part of the universe atoms. Our conscious Qi waves are closely connected with the Qi waves of the universe consciousness which set the parameter to guide each step of our path if we wish to discover within the happiness and health. 
 
Zen philosophy along with Zen way of living has been in lead in high conscious living beings for thousands of years. Zen Master DeRu sees Quantum theory along with scientific experiment of quantum physics gives lights, like taking many pictorial shots of reality of the world, to ordinary conscious beings, believers and non believers alike to observe and see the truth of the world, and the conscious universe in communication and expansion with unlimited potentiality without time or space limitations. 
 
DeRu firmly believes, "In that Zen world one begins to see, In lieu of the fittest and fiercest fight for victory and survival with competitiveness from the selected few, humanity leading all conscious beings together claim victory by synergy and cooperation with compassion and love. 
 
DeRu maintains, "war and fierce competition is for ignorant self-serving few, leading to self-destruction, it is, he said, the synergy in peace with harmony in cooperation leading all beings to greater development in advancement of conscious beings." 
 
"Leaving Newton as a hero of the past," he insists, "we must move on, following vision of the Ancient Chan in all conscious, subconscious and superconscious communication, human beings shall explore further. seeing beyond and through that visible illusionary world into that true universe intelligence and wisdom, and see the true potential world beyond time and space with the guidance of Albert Einstein, Max Planck and Niels Bohrs scientific minds." 
 
Master Shi DeRu a 31 generation Shaolin Chan (Zen) Master has been teaching Living Zen Mind and Zen meditation with TaGong for over three decades worldwide, especially in China and the US.
