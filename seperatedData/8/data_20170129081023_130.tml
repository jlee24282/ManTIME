<TITLE>Photographs and memories: 1937 article reminisces about Thibodaux's first automobile</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By In 1937, Lafourche Comet editor John Taylor, likely struggling for editorial material to fill the week's paper, found himself reminiscing about cars and transportation in his youth; even the opening of the highway which in about 1918 finally connected Thibodaux directly with New Orleans, without the Donaldsonville link. 
 
Do You Remember What Happened 25 Years Ago? Taylor's rambling column in the Feb. 4, 1937, Comet began. 
 
To the above question, if you are 50 or thereabouts, you may answer 'yes'. If so, then who was the first one in Thibodaux to own an automobile? In reply you may ask: 'Why bring that up now?'" 
 
On Monday of this week, Taylor continued, a Thibodaux gentleman rang up the editor of the Comet and wanted to know who owned the first auto to be driven over the streets of Thibodaux? It was an altogether unexpected question, but we replied that, as far as we could remember, Dr. Felix Riviere was the first man here to have a car. 
 
Then we added that possibly it was Albert Trone, but we were not certain just which one was first. Since the phone conversation we are inclined to the belief that Mr. Trone was the first, he driving a one-seat, topless car on the streets here during the early part of 1909. 
 
Our questioner suggested: 'Was it not a Mr. Legendre, whose first name was Oleus?' 
 
We replied 'no', for the man whose first name was Oleus is still roaming around waiting for Father Time to 'get him'. Then we added that the last name was 'Legendre', but the first name, we thought, was 'Joe', there having been several 'Joe Legendres' in this town, but just after the phone conversation we called to mind that the correct name was 'Frank Legendre'. 
 
He had what his friends called a 'one lung' automobile, they calling it that way because it had but one cylinder and used to make the familiar noise of 'chug-chug', thus attracting attention wherever it went. 
 
Taylor's automotive ramble continued: One day, along in 1910, the Legendre 'horseless carriage' was passing our home. The late T.R. Simmons was in his room across the way in a two-story building where Hotel Jeffries now stands. Mr. Simmons, who was quite friendly with the late Mr. Legendre, raised the sash of a window and yelled out to the horseless carriage: 'Take that lawn-mower off the street,' but Mr. Legendre did not do it. He went right along with the 'chug-chug' carriage. 
 
We could mention a few other things about auto incidents of the past, but that might bore. Especially would we relate how the honest statement that 'we had no trouble at all.' 
 
You could believe that statement as long as you did not look at the driver's hands, for very few motorists went out those days and came back with clean hands, it being necessary for all of them to 'get out and get under' to find out why in the mischief the old machine would not work. 
 
However they invariably tried to deceive (not exactly 'lie' about the matter), but their mistake was to have with them a 'wife', a 'sister' or a 'child', so the 'day after the day before' the wife, sister or child would tell friends, confidentially, about the 'delightful' trip and suddenly the wife, sister or child would forget and say that 'everything was fine until we had a puncture', or until the spark plugs would not work, or the battery went 'dead,' so, then the 'cat was out of the bag' and every one knew that the trip to Labadieville or Lafourche Crossing was not such a 'dream', it being learned that 'Pa' had to get out and sweat pumping up a leaky tube, or 'Ma' had to help find the tools, she not knowing a monkey wrench from a screw-driver, but 'Ma' has since learned, and she can crank a car in fine fashion, especially if the engine is a self-starter. 
 
Taylor's rambling recollection was not nearly over: 
 
But all of these 'pleasant' or 'unpleasant' events have passed away ,and they are practically forgotten, but what we'd like to know is this: 
 
Who was the first person in Lafourche to drive a horse and buggy over the Raceland-Des Allemands-New Orleans road? We are not over-anxious to know, but the thought often flashes across our mind about the one who had the supreme pleasure. We remember recording in the Comet, about 20 years ago, about the trip being made over the road, but then we did not have the name of the person who performed such a feat. 
 
We are practically certain that no one in Thibodaux knows, but there are some citizens around Raceland or Lockport who know. Maybe, Hon Frank Barker the member of the Police Jury from Ward 9, can tell, because he was largely instrumental in having a road built through the swamp, that years ago stood as an impenetrable barrier to any one or anything save the 'iron horse' of the S.P.R.R. (Southern Pacific Railroad). 
 
To others it appeared a dense, watery forest, infested with reptiles, that could not be overcome. The job, however, was undertaken and pushed to completion by a progressive committee, headed by Mr. Barker; he and the Godchaux Co. Inc., the late C.S. Mathews, the Bowie Lumber Co. and the Des Allemands Land Company, represented by Mr. A.T. Dusenberry, agreeing to assume a special tax in order that the road might become a reality -- the practical and popular reality that is to-day. 
 
We trust that the foregoing reminiscent comments, aroused by a question regarding the first automobile that dared to appear in this parish, will be read with interest.
