<TITLE>Ronaldinho reveals PSG regret</TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Provided by Teamtalk  
Former Barcelona and Brazil superstar Ronaldinho has revealed one of his biggest regrets during the early part of his career with Paris Saint-Germain was not winning a Ligue 1 title. 
 
The magically gifted and skilful forward started out in Europe with PSG in 2001/02 before his superb performances saw him win a move to Barcelona in 2003/04, where he then spent five seasons. 
 
However, despite a glittering career for his many clubs and for Brazil, Ronaldinho is disappointed he did not win French football's highest honour during his time with the Parisians. 
 
He told PSG's official website: "What I regret is not having won the French title. That's what I missed most in my time with Paris. In 2003, we made it to the Coupe de France final, but unfortunately, we lost to Auxerre. It's always tough to deal with that kind of defeat after having such a good run. 
 
"Paris is a special club for me, as it was here that I launched my European career. I have a lot of respect and love for this club. Of course, it's special for me to come back to where it all began for me! The fans gave me a lot of affection and respect. I'd like to thank them for that. Each time I run into Paris fans around the world, they told me that I made them very happy. I'm very proud of that."
