<TITLE>Post Assault, SLB Calls Out The Incident, Refutes Rumours Of 'Objectionable Scenes' In...</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The film fraternity and cinema lovers got a rude awakening when filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali got assaulted in Jaipur for making Padmavati. 
 
The National award-winning director was attacked in the Pink City by the members of a Rajput community group a couple of days back. Whats more, they even vandalized the sets at Jaigarh Fort alleging that the makers are distorting facts in the movie which is based on Alauddin Khiljis obsession with Rani Padamvati.

This shocking incident drove the makers to immediately halt the shoot. A statement issued by the makers read, 
 "Sanjay Leela Bhansali has shot two films in Jaipur and despite his love for Rajasthan, for the safety of his crew, we have decided to stop the shoot and leave the city post the shocking incident where miscreants damaged property and misbehaved with the crew on the shoot of 'Padmavati'".

Bhansalis tryst with the story of Padmavati is not new. In fact, he had earlier directed an opera on the courageous Queens life, which received an overwhelming response and a house full of audience in Paris. He then decided to come up with a full-fledged movie on the same. 
 
Many people are outraging on the fact that it features an intimate scene between the notorious Khilji and Rani Padmavati played by Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone respectively. The director refuted all such claims. He said,

 "We clarify that there is no dream sequence or any objectionable scene between Rani Padmavati and Allauddin Khilji. We have been carefully researching and making the film. In spite of this, the attack on the shoot and crew was uncalled for and was extremely damaging to the image of the beautiful city of Jaipur."  
In fact, the makers believe that people will be proud of their story. 
 "We are confident that Mewar will be proud of the film made on their revered queen. We do not want to hurt any sentiments and would appreciate if the local people support us in making this film and making their queen revered by the world."

However, in the wake of the shocking incident, SLB and his crew unanimously decided to cancel the shooting of their film. 
 
The shooting has been stopped by the filmmaker at Jaigarh Fort and they have vacated the place, SHO Amer police station Narendra Kumar said.

       A source close to the production said, The makers have already clarified that there are no scenes between Padmavati and Allaudin Khiljis characters. Bhansali has shot his movies in Rajasthan in the past but he never faced any problem. What happened was unfortunate and the team is packing up.
