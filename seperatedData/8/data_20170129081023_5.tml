<TITLE>College basketball: Banks, Garner lead Penn State over Illinois</TITLE>
<TEXT>
STATE COLLEGE, Pa.  Shep Garner mightve been selling himself short when he said with a straight face on Saturday he doesnt consider himself that athletic. 
 
Theres plenty of evidence against that, especially in Penn States leading scorers wrists. 
 
Garner sparked the Nittany Lions with hot shooting early, took a heavy charge and sank critical free throws late, and his 18 points helped lift Penn State to a 71-67 win over Illinois on Saturday. 
 
Shep really set the tone for us, Penn State coach Patrick Chambers said. To make a huge shot and make his free throws down the stretch there, that shows where his head is right now and his mindset. I think we see an emerging leader. 
 
Payton Banks added 17 points, Tony Carr picked up 13 and Mike Watkins chipped in 10 and pulled down nine rebounds to help Penn State (12-10, 4-5 Big Ten) snap a 3-game losing skid. 
 
They couldnt have done it without those free throws from Garner as Illinois (13-9, 3-6) closed the gap after trailing by 20 at halftime. 
 
Malcolm Hill led Illinois (13-9, 3-6) with 19 points and Jalen Colman-Lands added 13. Coleman-Lands cut the lead to 65-62 with a 3-pointer with 1:58 left before Garner hit four free throws in the final 38 seconds to keep it out of reach. 
 
I didnt like our disposition at all in the first half, Illinois coach John Groce said. I thought it was unacceptable. Just didnt think we were really good. We could be here for 30 minutes picking on a variety of areas in the first half. 
 BIG PICTURE  
Illinois: The Fighting Illini dropped to 0-5 on the road. Theyll return home for their next two but it wont get any easier  their next two opponents are a combined 33-10  before heading back out of town to face third-place Northwestern (17-4, 6-2). 
 
Penn State: The Nittany Lions needed to reboot after being outscored by an average of 26 points in their last two losses on the road. 
 BIG FIRST HALF  
Garner, who entered the game shooting just 36 percent from 3-point range, admitted he had been frustrated with his shots not falling. 
 
His solution? 
 
Ive definitely got in the gym more over the past week, Garner said. A little bit of extra work didnt hurt. 
 
Penn State led for all but 1:15 and took control early with pinpoint shooting sparked by Garners first make  the first of nine 3-pointers for Penn State  on his first attempt. 
 
The Nittany Lions made 60 percent of their first-half shots and Garner and Banks combined to make 8 of 13 from the field and 6 of 9 3s. 
 
DUNKS FOR THE WIN 
 
Penn State got it done inside, too, mostly with big dunks that brought a sizable Bryce Jordan Center crowd to its feet. 
 
None of Penn States six dunks were nicer than a big slam by Watkins with less than a minute in the first half. Garner noted the setup  a drive and behind-the-back feed from Terrence Samuel  mightve been prettier. 
 
Those guys are slashers, they like to get in the paint and finish, Garner said. When were hitting shots, the defense has to try to contain (Banks and Garner) and the Red Sea opens. When were open, theyre tough to guard. 
 
UP NEXT 
 
Illinois hosts No. 15 Wisconsin on Tuesday. 
 
Penn State travels to Indiana on Wednesday.
