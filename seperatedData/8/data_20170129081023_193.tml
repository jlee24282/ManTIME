<TITLE>How Trumps New Visa Ban Will Affect Those In The Middle East</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Protests have kicked off after the new US President blocks citizens of seven countries from visiting the States. 

He infamouslyannounced he wanted toban Muslims from entering the USduring his presidential candidacy, and now Donald Trump looks to be sticking firm to his promises. 

The controversial businessman on Friday inked an executive order blocking nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries from enteringthe States  even if they had visas already in place. 

The nations in question are all part of the MENA region, namelyLibya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria,Yemen, Iran and Iraq. 

An estimated 130 million people will now effectively be unable to enter the US for the next 90 days.

In addition, Trumps order also prevents immigration by Syrian citizens indefinitely, and also blocks refugee admissions for 120 days. 

While theres still confusion over the situation for those with dualcitizenship, and nationals of blocked countries who have lawful US visas, its believed they currently will be held at airports if they fly to the States from overseas (regardless of whatever passport they travel with). 

However a Department of Homeland Security official said on Saturday that no green-card holders from the countries mentionedin Trumps order had been prevented from entering the country, but they would need additional screening. 

Im establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Dont want them here, Trump told media over the weekend. 

Its not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared. Its working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over. 

Judge sets up roadblock 

While Trumps executive order was effective immediately, a federal judge threw a spanner in his works on Saturday with an emergency ruling. 

Judge Ann Donnelly announced she was granting a stay that would prevent the government from deporting immigrants currently detained in airports around the US. 

Deporting refugees and visa-holderswould cause substantial and irreparable injury, the judge said.

However the ruling only protects those who had already arrived in the US, not those heading to the States in the imminent future while Trumps order still stands. 

Realistically, we dont even know if people are going to be allowed onto the planes, American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Lee Gelernt told AP. This order would protect people who they allow to come here and reach US soil. 

An estimated 170 people were denied entry to the US after the order was signed, Reuters reported, leading to mass protests outside US airports.

Trump to chat to UAEroyal 

The US President will hold a phone call with HHSheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, later today,the White House said in a brief statement. 

Trump will also talk with Saudi ArabiasKing Salmanand acting president of South Korea,Hwang Kyo-Ahn, amid the furore  though the discussions are not believed to be solely focused around his visa ban. 

While the UAE isnt one of the countries targeted by the ban, many living here could likely be affected  up to 1.1 million, in fact. 

Its estimated that around 240,000 Syrians and500,000 Iranians live in the UAE, Whats On reports, along with tens of thousands of Somalis, Sudanese, Iraqis, and Yemenis.

And even UAE nationals heading to the US may face hefty delays, with Trump revealing heavy vetting will be in place at airports. 

Were going to have extreme vetting in all cases. And I mean extreme, the President told ABC News last week. 

And were not letting people in if we think theres even a little chance of some problem. 

For other countries were gonna have extreme vetting. Its going to be very hard to come in. Right now its very easy to come in. Its gonna be very, very hard. I dont want terror in this country.
