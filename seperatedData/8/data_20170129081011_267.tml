<TITLE>Illinois was first state to observe MLK Jr. Day</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By Dear Jerry: 
 
The recently celebrated Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday has me confused. 
 
After spending most of my life in Galena, Ill., I moved last year to an assisted living community in Dubuque, Iowa. Regarding the MLK Jr. holiday, I am panicked that my mind may be playing tricks on me. After reading Ask Jerry for many years, I am optimistic you will settle my concern. Here is the issue. 
 
Earlier this month, my new senior-citizen neighbors and I were watching the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday observances. There was a fair amount of coverage on television. It mentioned that MLK Jr. Day did not become a holiday until 1983. Unless my mind is totally disappearing from reality, I have a clear recollection that we celebrated Martin Luther King, Jr. Day during the mid-1970s. 
 
Am I totally losing my memory?

Dear Mary: 
 
Your memory sounds excellent to me. When you lived in Galena, Illinois, you happen to reside in the first state to observe Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as an official holiday. It was 1973 when Illinois adopted it as a state holiday. 
 
Four days after the assassination of The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. (1968), legislation was introduced to make MLK Jr. Day a federal holiday. However, it took 15 years before legislation was passed (1983). Then, it was another three years before the legislation and MLK Jr. Day were in effect (1986). 
 
The holiday was not observed immediately in all 50 states though DC, like Illinois, observed it officially before it became a national holiday. Following a tourist boycott, Arizona approved the holiday in 1992. New Hampshire, the last state to acknowledge Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in its own right, did not adopt the holiday until 1999. It was 13 years after it became a federal holiday that New Hampshire actually changed the name of its Civil Rights Day to Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Obviously, this holiday did not happen instantly across the United States. 
 
Even today, there are three southern states that combine Martin Luther King, Jr. Day with Robert E. Lee Day. Those are Alabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi. Albeit controversial, that one-stop holiday still exists in those states. 
 
In fact, many variations have occurred throughout the country and over the years. For example, the Commonwealth of Virginia merged the commemoration of Robert E. Lee, Thomas J. (Stonewall) Jackson, and Martin Luther King, Jr. into one holiday. Although the Lee and Jackson portion were subsequently separated from the King portion, Lee-Jackson-King Day was observed annually in Virginia from 1984 through 2000. 
 
While hardly a comprehensive history, that would be a CliffsNotes version of the MLK Jr. holiday. Meanwhile, Mary, I am impressed that you recall events so specifically from the mid-1970s. Congratulations.
