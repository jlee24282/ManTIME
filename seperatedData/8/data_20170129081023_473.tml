JAKARTA: Immigration officers at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Bali have stopped an Australian from entering the resort island based on an Interpol report alleging that the man, identified only as DNW, is a pedophile. 
 
DNW was searched by Interpol. [There is] an indication that he was involved in a pedophile case in a place somewhere. It could be that he was a fugitive of Interpol or the Australian Federal Police, immigration office spokesman Agung Sampurno told kompas.com on Saturday. 
 
Agung said DNW arrived at the airport on Friday on an AirAsia flight from Perth. He was deported back to Perth on Saturday at about 7am, local time. 
 
He said his office had earlier received notice from Australian authorities on the planned arrival of DNW. 
 
We managed to detect the man shortly after he arrived here and deported him, he added. 
 
According to data from the immigration directorate, as many as 652 foreigners were prevented from entering Bali through the airport last year.  The Jakarta Post/Asia News Network
