<TITLE>ANALYSIS: Countries where Trump does business are not hit by new travel restrictions</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The nations targeted for new visitation restrictions by President Donald Trump on Friday all have something in common: They are places he does not appear to have any business interests.

The executive order he signed bars entry for the next 90 days by travelers from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya. Excluded are several majority-Muslim nations where the Trump Organization is active and which in some cases have faced issues with terrorism.

The restriction applies to countries that have already been excluded from programs allowing people to travel to the United States without a visa because of concerns over terrorism. Hewing closely to nations already named as terrorism concerns elsewhere in law might have allowed the White House to avoid angering some more powerful and wealthy majority Muslim allies, such as Egypt.

But without divesting from his company, as bipartisan ethics experts had advised, Mr. Trump is now facing questions about whether he designed the new rules with his own business at least partly in mind.

He needs to sell his businesses outside his family and place the assets in a blind trust, otherwise every decision he makes people are going to question if hes making the decision in the interests of the American people or his own bottom line, said Jordan Libowitz, spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group. The group filed a lawsuit arguing Mr. Trump is violating a constitutional provision barring federal officials from accepting payments from foreign officials.

Earlier this week, Norm Eisen, the groups chairman and an ethics adviser to Barack Obama, tweeted: WARNING: Mr. Pres. your Muslim ban excludes countries where you have business interests. That is a CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION. See u in court.

Stephanie Grisham, a White House spokeswoman, said, The high-risk territories are based on Congressional statute and nothing else.

Mr. Trump said he has handed management of his business to his sons to avoid the perception that he is making presidential decisions to boost his own business. But he has retained ownership of the company, meaning if it thrives, he will personally profit.

Mr. Trumps order makes no mention of Turkey, which has faced several terrorist attacks in recent months. On Wednesday, the State Department updated a travel warning for Americans visiting Turkey.

Mr. Trump has licensed his name to two luxury towers in Istanbul. A Turkish company manufactures a line of Trump-branded home furnishings. Mr. Trumps most recent financial disclosure, filed in May, showed that he had earned as much as $6 million in the previous year from the deals.

I have a little conflict of interest cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul, he said in a December 2015 interview with Breitbart News. More recently, he has insisted that he has no conflicts because laws making conflicts illegal do not apply to the president.

Also untouched by Fridays executive order is the United Arab Emirates, a powerful Muslim ally with whom the United States has complicated relations. Mr. Trump has licensed his name to a Dubai golf resort, as well as a luxury home development and spa.

Mr. Trump has seemed disinclined to divorce himself of interests in the project. Its developer, Hussain Sajwani, recently attended a party at Mr. Trumps Florida estate, where a video showed Mr. Trump singling him out for praise.

Mr. Trump returned to the topic of his Dubai partnership this month at a news conference intended to show how he was separating from his business.

Over the weekend, I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the Middle East - Hussein, Damac, a friend of mine, great guy. And I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai - a number of deals, and I turned it down, Mr. Trump said.

His point was that he was turning aside new projects that could raise ethical questions. An attorney for the company announced at the same event that the Trump Organization will embark on no new foreign deals while Mr. Trump is in office.

The executive order makes no mention of Saudi Arabia, home of 15 of the 19 terrorists involved in the 9/11 attacks. The Trump Organization had incorporated several limited liability companies in preparation for an attempt to build a hotel in Saudi Arabia, showing an interest in expansion there. The company canceled those incorporations in December, indicating that no project is moving forward.

Excluded as well is Indonesia, the worlds largest majority-Muslim nation, where there are two Trump-branded resorts underway.

To be blunt, we really dont know what to make of which motives are driving this presidents decisions, said Kamal Essaheb, director of policy and advocacy for the National Immigration Law Center. From what we could tell from his campaign and his actions since he became president, what seems to be first and foremost on his mind is his own self-interest and an obsession with his brand.
