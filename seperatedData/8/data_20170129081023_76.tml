<TITLE>Diabetic foot tales</TITLE>
<TEXT>
WE are all aware of how big a problem diabetes is throughout the world and here in Jamaica. The prevalence of type two diabetes is growing at a frightening rate and we are seeing younger patients with this type of diabetes, which was almost unheard of 20 years ago. 
 
Diabetes can have a devastating effect on the leg and foot. Today, I want to share two stories with you about what my patients have experienced. 
 
PATIENT ONE 
 
We shall call this young lady Jane for the sake of the article. Jane was a 35-year-old teacher who was an insulin-dependent diabetic. She had been diagnosed at age 13 with type one diabetes. This is where the pancreas stops producing insulin. It is often diagnosed in early childhood and the cause is not yet known. 
 
The condition had left her with severe numbness in her feet (neuropathy). One evening while dining at home with her family, she became aware of a burning smell. Jane couldnt quite put her finger on where the smell was coming from. 
 
She sent one of her children to the kitchen to check if she had left anything on the stove. It was turned off. 
 
The smell became progressively worse and after about five minutes, her youngest child looked under the table. She screamed out in horror when the source of the burning smell was discovered. 
 
For the entire meal, Janes foot had been resting on a lit mosquito coil and it had literally burnt a hole through her flesh. Jane could not feel a thing due to the neuropathy, even when she looked at her burning flesh. 
 
She washed the foot with cool water and wrapped it in a bandage and decided to visit me the next day. 
 
Now, what she should have done was to go to her local hospital for emergency treatment, but because of how late it was when the incident occurred and having to take care of two young children, she left it until the following day. 
 
When she arrived at my office her foot was swollen, infected and hot to the touch, but Jane could not feel a thing. Of course, this gave her a false sense of security. 
 
It took four months of intense treatment to heal the foot. Luckily, she only needed to have one toe amputated. Had she waited longer to seek assistance the situation could have been more grave. However, if she had attended the hospital on the night of the injury, we could have been able to save the toe. 
 
The moral of this story is to immediately seek help if you have any injury or problem with your feet and you are diabetic. 
 
To be able to feel pain is a defence mechanism. It warns you of danger and alerts you to injury. If you lose your pain sensation you become vulnerable. This can be as simple as a pair of shoes rubbing against a toe where the patient cannot feel it. This can ultimately lead to amputation. 
 
Be aware of your surroundings; wear supportive, roomy footwear and check your feet for injury every night. 
 
PATIENT TWO 
 
We will call patient two John. John had type two diabetes, which means there is insulin resistance in the cells of the body. 
 
The cause includes obesity, hereditary factors, poor diet, and a sedentary lifestyle. John was a well-controlled diabetic patient. He was fairly well educated in the knowledge of how to look after his feet. He knew it was important never to go barefoot as he had neuropathy and could not feel anything up to his ankles. 
 
One day he went up a ladder to pick fruits from a tree in his yard. As he finished he jumped down the last steps and headed towards the house. He kicked off one of his yard slippers and put his foot in his house slipper. As he tried to kick off the other slipper he noticed that it wouldnt come off. 
 
He looked down to see a six-inch nail poking through the top of his shoe and it had wedged his shoe to his foot. He felt no pain at all. 
 
John sensibly wrapped the foot with the shoe and nail still attached in a towel and took a taxi straight to the hospital. That night he underwent surgery and his foot was saved. 
 
He attended my office for the next few months for follow-up treatment and now he is fit and healthy. 
 
This story had a great outcome. John sought immediate medical help when he saw how serious the situation was. The advice from this story is similar to the last. Wear the appropriate footwear for the job at hand. A flimsy pair of flip-flops were obviously not adequate. 
 
The good thing is that he sought treatment immediately and didnt try to deal with the situation himself. I have seen patients over the years who have had a very bad cut and have been trying to self-treat. With the diabetic patient this will often lead to infection and possible amputation. 
 
In my next article I will focus on how to protect your feet and diabetic foot health education.
