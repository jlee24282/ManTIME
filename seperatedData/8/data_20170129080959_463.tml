Mary Katherine Holloway has been crowned the new Miss Walker County for 2017. 
 
Holloway, 22, is a native of Hamilton, who placed as second runner-up in last years Miss Walker County pageant. She graduated from Hamilton High School, earned an associates degree in liberal arts from Bevill State Community College and received a bachelors degree in elementary education from the University of North Alabama. 
 
She is the daughter of Gena and Marlon Holloway, and is currently in her first year of pursuing a masters degree in special education from the University of North Alabama. 
 
Holloways platform is The R-Word: Spread the Word to End the Word, which encourages people to change the language they use when referring to someone with an intellectual disability. Holloway says her brother, Grant, is one of the people who have inspired her the most along her journey to being crowned Miss Walker County. She said she is also thankful to her mom for her support. 
 
[Grant] is turning 30 this year, which is unbelievable, and he has an intellectual disability. He is the reason why my platform is what it is, Holloway said. I would love to work with my platform here [in Walker County]. A couple of years ago in Hamilton, we did a 5K run for Windows Unlimited, and here theres actually a center like Windows Unlimited ... for adults with intellectual disabilities, so I would like to work with them. 
 
During the talent portion of the competition, Holloway did a ballet routine to You Raise Me Up. 
 
Second runner-up in the pageant was Haleyvilles EmmaBeth Dorris. She also won the Peoples Choice Award. 
 
First runner-up was Cullman native Jessica Patterson, who also won the Walker County Arts Alliance Talent Scholarship and a Hudson Music Studio award for her baton performance of Proud Mary. 
 
Dora graduate Sarah Neill won the Leigh Sherer Scholarship and the Dorthy and Nelson Hudson Memorial Scholarship. 
 
Other pageant participants were Nellie Stallsmith, who graduated from Walker High School, and Kourtney Wells of Winfield. 
 
Miss Walker County 2014 Sarai Ingle Bender was the Mistress of Ceremonies for the pageant, sponsored by the Pilot Club of Jasper. 
 
Holloway, who was crowned by Miss Walker County 2016 Ashlyn Winkler, said she plans to be heavily involved in the Walker County community. 
 
I am super excited, expecially to represent all of Walker County, so its a very surreal feeling, she said. I would love to go to the schools here in Walker County and talk to the students, and have them sign pledges to spread the word to end the word.
