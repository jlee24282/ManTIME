<TEXT>
In his retirement, Brian Schaab was a keen rose grower. 
   
When he was just a kid, Cameron Schaabwatched his dad leave for Washington DCwith hair samples in an envelopeand a dogged determination to find the truth. 
 
Detective Sergeant Brian Schaab  wasleading a police team aiming to catch one of New Zealand's worst criminals and was becoming the kind of role model that sets the course of a son's life. 
 
Cameron Schaab spoke on Sunday after the death of his father: the man who arrestedJules Mikus, 15 years after his 1987 abduction, rape and murder of Napier schoolgirl Teresa Cormack. 
 
Brian Schaab died last week from complications related to his treatment for cancer, his son said. 
 
  
 
Cameron Schaabwasglad his dad had a chance to see him in police uniform, after he graduated from police college in December and was posted to South Auckland. 
 
"That was one of the things I looked forward to, after everything that happened at work getting home to tell Dad about it." 
 
He said a big part of hisinspirationto join the police came from his dad's 44 years in the force. It was a job that left BrianSchaabwell-knownand liked in Hawke's Bay. 
 
His dogged detective work eventually saw Mikus convicted in 2002 for killingCormack, after a breakthrough in the case that happened when Cameron Schaab was only about 5 or 6. 
 
"I don't really remember a huge deal of it, but Dad went on a trip to Washington DC with an envelope that had a couple of hairs, when DNA testing was cutting-edge, and that was the only place that could do it." 
 
His father gave him some simple advice: to "always go with your gut". 
 
"Even if things seem to line up on paper, but it's still not sitting right, then keep digging, and keep pushing on with it." 
 
Brian Schaabretired in February2012, but kept busy with work that included becoming a volunteer driver for the Hawke's Bay Cancer Society. 
 
Manager Trudy Kirkspoke through tears about Schaab, a "wonderful" man whohad worked for a year with the groupdriving the shuttle van three times a week to Palmerston North Hospital for treatment. 
 
"I get upset talking about him. He has got such a go-to attitude, he has enormous respect and empathy for people, driving ourservice and being there for clients." 
 
Schaab never spoke of his work as a detective. "We were all aware of it, but he never talked about it." 
 
Detective Senior Sergeant Dave de Lange said Schaabwas a dedicated police officer and a committed member of the CIB. 
 
He was influential and had major involvement in the armed offenders squad in the Hawke's Bay. His commitment and enjoyment of the challenge of detectivework made him a good investigator. 
 
Schaabis survived by four children.
