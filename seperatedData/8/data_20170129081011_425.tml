<TITLE>Ronaldinho: I will never be a coach - I can't make it through 90 minutes!</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Ronaldinho 36 will be present as PSG take on Monaco in a vital Ligue 1 encounter on Sunday but judging by his comments it is not an experience he will entirely relishing

"I cannot watch 90 minutes otherwise I suffer" the Ballon d'Or winner said "I like to see the best moments the goals That's why I would never become a coach"

Ronaldinho reached the pinnacle of the game with Barcelona but it was at PSG that he made his name in Europe and he remembers his time at the Parc des Princes fondly

Ramos issues Real rallying cry

"Everyone respects me here and gives me a lot of hugs" he added "It's a club that I love so much I do not know why people love me so much here - I am speechless when I see it all

"I am a son of PSG When I arrived here the gates of Europe were opened for me

"My time here was very special There were the games against Marseille and Bordeaux the goal against Guingamp these are moments that I cannot forget To choose a favourite is impossible "I often speak with people who work at the club or who play here The change of direction has not changed anything There are still people who are here who were here in my day I still keep in touch"

Meanwhile the free agent picked a rather surprising choice as his favourite in this PSG side that includes Edinson Cavani Angel Di Maria Thiago Silva and Lucas Moura

"Thiago Motta" Ronaldinho said "for me hes class I love to see him play he is different from all the others We played together for a long time at Barcelona and that's why I know him well"

Ronaldinho did concede he has one regret from his two years spent at PSG between 2001 and 2003

"Not winning a title is something that still makes me sad today" he said "In my time there was a nice team with Jay-Jay Okocha Nicolas Anelka Aloisio  It is a pity that things did not go well 

"Today there are great players and it is certain that playing in this team would have been a pleasure But my time here was the best of my life"

PSG are chasing another Ligue 1 title but lie three points off Monacos pace ahead of Sundays meeting in the French capital
