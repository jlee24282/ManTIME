 Former Cy Young pitcher has throat cancer  
SAN DIEGO  Randy Jones, the San Diego Padres first Cy Young Award winner, is fighting throat cancer linked to tobacco use during his baseball career. 
 
Jones told the San Diego Union-Tribune on Thursday that he has been undergoing radiation and chemotherapy treatments since being diagnosed in November. 
 
The 67-year-old former pitcher says the cancer was caught early and hasnt spread. Jones said doctors told him its a result of the chewing tobacco he used as a player. He has smoked cigars throughout his adult life. 
 
Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn, a longtime Padres star and franchise icon, died of salivary gland cancer in 2014 that he believed was related to using tobacco during his major league career. Jones was drafted by the Padres in 1972 and became the clubs first pitcher to appear in an All-Star Game in 1975. He was an All-Star the following year when he won the NL Cy Young Award.

 Maine high school deploys deaf mascot  
PORTLAND, Maine  Kamron King says his goal as the first deaf mascot at Portland High School is something he wont always notice: making the crowd louder.

Kamron says being deaf doesnt interfere with performing, other than occasionally needing someone to direct him toward young children in need of a high-five. The costumes heavy mask obscures his vision. Kamrons parents say its a natural fit for a kid who loves sports and costumes.
