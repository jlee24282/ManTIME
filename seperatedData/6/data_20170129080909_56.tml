<TITLE>Benin hit by neighbouring Nigerias car import ban</TITLE>
<TEXT>
He and his colleagues dont have much else to do There hasnt been a single customer since December when neighbouring Nigeria banned car imports by land as part of a wave of protectionist policies that are strangling Benins economy

"We spend our days smoking its our life now" Hijazi sighs sitting in a gazebo beside his stock of thousands of cars steadily accumulating the dry winter dust

This afternoon Hijazi  who like the vast majority of car dealers in Benin is Lebanese  called in his Beninese accountant to help close up shop

Debts are accumulating and the stress is becoming too much "I lost in one year what I have earned in 16" Ali Assi another car dealer told AFP

Of the 2500 Lebanese dealers in Cotonou 1600 have packed up and left in the last six months shutting down businesses that employed dozens of drivers cleaners and security staff

"Unemployed people used to come here to find work" said Vincent Gouton who represents a group of car dealership managers in Cotonou

The Benin car market began its free fall last year when neighbouring Nigeria entered its first recession since 1994

Nigeria an economic behemoth of 190 million people gobbles up "99 percent of car exports" in Benin according to Gouton

Benin a tiny country with scarce natural resources relies on its port business to survive

From the port city of Cotonou imported cars fabrics and food from all over the world get distributed across west Africa

But since the Nigerian economy crashed following the collapse in global oil prices Benin has been suffering knock-on effects

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buharis protectionist policies  his government has banned a slew of items including cars imported by land  has only aggravated the situation

Encourage smuggling 

"This decision will encourage smuggling its back to square one" Gouton said

Several agreements were signed in the past between Benin and Nigeria to facilitate legal trade

But Nigeria accuses Beninese customs of failing to monitor the exported goods and collect taxes

Buhari hopes that closing land borders will revitalise Nigerian industries and attract business to the port at Lagos Nigerias economic capital and largest city

Today over 20 products  the list has never been officially published  are banned from being imported overland

"For the past 18 months we have seen a lot of policies that are not market friendly" said Nigerian economist Nonso Obikili

"The self-sufficiency policy has led the government to create all sorts of hostile environments around import" Obikili said

"The government wants to ban palm oil imports but our plantations are not ready to meet local demand and it takes two years to get oil from trees Its a mess" Obikili told AFP

"And this will encourage illegal trade"

Killing business 

It isnt just Benin which is hurting

Nigerian car dealer Olabanji Akinola said he had to fire half of his employees last week as a result of the ban

Business used to be brisk at Akinolas car dealership located on the outskirts of Lagos

Yet now he cant pay any wages "In Cotonou they tax 35 percent of the value of an imported car In Lagos its 70 percent" Akinola said "Its killing the business"

"The price of cars will go up and the smuggling will increase There are 200 roads through the bush to come to Nigeria the borders are porous" Akinola said

"This morning customers begged me on my knees to lower my prices but I cannot" Akinola said

Ultimately it may only be the Nigerian government who benefits from the import ban

In 2016 customs seized 307 contraband vehicles worth nearly 5 billion naira about 15 million euros The figure is expected to rise in 2
