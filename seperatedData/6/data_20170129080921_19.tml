<TITLE>Lamar whips Demon, 85-64</TITLE>
<TEXT>
BEAUMONT, Texas (NSU) - Lamars Cardinals had their collective backs against the wall Saturday afternoon and played like it. 
 
After losing three of their last four, including a homecourt defeat Wednesday night, the Cardinals shot 55 percent, shockingly dominated the boards and converted Northwestern State turnovers at a high rate to whip the visiting Demons 85-64 in Southland Conference basketball. 
 
The Demons lost for the first time in three games and for the second time in their last five, while playing their third straight on the road. NSU (8-10 overall, 3-5 in the Southland) carved a 21-point deficit shortly after halftime down to 53-46, but the Cardinals (13-9, 5-4) responded by scoring the next nine points beginning a decisive 16-2 run. 
 
Lamar posted a dominating 39-21 rebounding advantage over an NSU squad that had out-rebounded Southeastern Louisiana by 16 on Wednesday night. The Cardinals outscored the Demons 30-14 in points off turnovers, although Lamar had 19 miscues to 18 for NSU. 
 
They were focused and did what they had to do, said Demons coach Mike McConathy. Theyd lost three of their last four and played with the urgency we expected, and we did not come close to matching it. It was obvious, for whatever reason, that we didnt find that extra push. 
 
Thats what weve been living off in the last two games, he said. We didnt have the extra energy to win the 50-50 balls and it seemed like Lamar got nearly every one. We didnt lay down by any means, but we werent very effective except in a couple of spurts. 
 
We played so hard the last two games, and we were trying really hard today, but couldnt find our backsides with our own two hands, said McConathy. 
 
NSU sank only 32 percent of its first-half shots, falling behind 42-25. The Demons dumped in 52 percent afterward, including 6 of 9 on 3-pointers, but threatened only briefly. A 19-5 run over 4:36 brought the visitors within seven points before Lamar regained control. 
 
The Cardinals got 18 points apiece from Southland Player of the Week Colton Weisbrod and Nick Garth, who hit 5 of 7 on 3-pointers after halftime, and Josh Nzeakor scored 17 inside. 
 
The Demons were led by Sabri Thompsons 16 points and three steals. Devonte Hall scored 13 while issuing seven assists and making three steals. Iziahiah Sweeney also scored 13. 
 
NSU will wrap up its string of four consecutive road games next Thursday night at Central Arkansas. The Demons play at home next Saturday afternoon against Stephen F. Austin.
