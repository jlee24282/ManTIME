<TITLE>Evaluating QBs an inexact science</TITLE>
<TEXT>
MOBILE  Coming into the week, Josh Dobbs understood the challenge ahead of him at the 2017 Senior Bowl.

It was the same challenge former Mississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott faced a year ago before he translated a MVP performance in the game into a fourth-round NFL draft selection and one of the more surprising rookie campaigns since former third-round pick Russell Wilson.

But while players making the rise from a second- or third-day pick to a successful NFL starting quarterback are few, they show how picking quarterbacks is an inexact science.

Quarterback is a different position than any other position, really, Dobbs said Tuesday during Senior Bowl media night. Youre evaluating college quarterbacks that all come from different schemes and have a different understanding of the game, and youre trying to figure out which one can help your organization be the most successful in the shortest amount of time possible. So its a different animal.

The biggest challenge is trying to determine if a quarterbacks skills  which are usually highlighted within the college games spread offenses  can translate to pro-style systems.

Its definitely a different game. Even if you look at the (Senior Bowl) practice field, theres three sets of hashes  high school, college and professional  so that creates a different type of football game, Chicago Bears head coach John Fox, whose staff is coaching the North Team, said Tuesday. From the quarterbacks and the systems, we had to spend 20 minutes last night working on the quarterback (being) under the center to be able to snap the ball. So that parts different.

But the challenges run deeper than snapping, a fact made evident by the varying amount of progress made within the most recent quarterback class.

Of the 15 quarterbacks drafted last year, only four attempted more than 85 passes in the NFL this past season  Los Angeles Rams Jared Goff, Philadelphias Carson Wentz, Clevelands Cody Kessler and Dallas Prescott.

Prescott was the surprise of this years class after being drafted in the fourth round, leading all rookies with 23 touchdowns to just four interceptions.

Its kind of like Tom Brady being a sixth-round pick, Fox said Tuesday. If (the Patriots) knew he was going to be Tom Brady, they might not have waited until the sixth round, and its the same thing for Dak.

Meanwhile, Goff and Wentz  the No. 1 and No. 2 overall picks  had completely different rookie seasons, with Wentz starting from Week 1 and finishing with a rookie-best 3,782 yards. Goff started the final seven games but never looked comfortable, throwing seven interceptions to five touchdowns while completing just 54.6 percent of his passes.

I think we put so much pressure on it, we promote those guys  you pump up Jared Goff, you bump up Carson Wentz  because you need one, former Green Bay Packers assistant director of personnel Marc Lillibridge said Wednesday. You know, if you want to have success, youve got to find a guy.

In 2012 four quarterbacks were taken in the first round, but only No. 1 overall pick Andrew Luck and No. 8 pick Ryan Tannehill are consistent starters.

Washingtons Kirk Cousins  a fourth-round pick  led all fifth-year quarterbacks with 4,917 passing yards this season, while Wilson, a third-round pick, led the Seahawks to their fifth straight postseason appearance.

Thats the thing, you get mesmerized by certain (attributes), you put a guy in a box and you think hes got to be this to win for us, but he doesnt, said Lillibridge, a former NFL scout and agent who now works in the private sector. Thats why Seattles doing so well because they took a chance on a guy in Russell Wilson who doesnt check a lot of boxes, and neither does Drew Brees.

But they have some kind of moxy, something that works for them. And its tough  trust me, Ive done a lot of quarterback reports, and Ive missed on more than Ive hit.

But the one thing that separates the top quarterbacks from the rest is the ability to maintain poise and maneuver within the pocket, especially when faced against the speed of NFL defenses.

Pass rush gives quarterbacks a lot of issues in the NFL. Youre seeing it with Jared Goff  thats the toughest thing for quarterbacks, said CBSSports.com senior NFL Draft analyst Dane Brugler. The best in the NFL do it really well  Aaron Rodgers, obviously, Tom Brady, those guys do a great job of dealing with pressure and delivering downfield, and thats something a lot of college quarterbacks dont have to do.

Whether a player like Dobbs, who started for the South in Saturdays Senior Bowl and finished with 104 total yards and an interception on 12-of-15 passing, has what it takes to handle that is yet to be seen.

But as the 10th ranked quarterback in this years draft class  according to CBSSports.coms positional rankings  and a third-day option, Dobbs wont face the same pressure to contribute early as expected first-round options such as Clemsons Deshaun Watson, North Carolinas Mitch Trubinsky or Notre Dames DeShone Kizer.

You dont know whats in a guys heart, you dont know how he reads defenses, Lillibridge said. You try to put them through every scenario you possibly can.  But a lot of times you dont know the competitive spirit in a guys head.
