The roadshow will begin from the GPO Park, near the Gandhi state, and will go through the Mayfair roundabout to Lalbagh, Novelty roundabout and then maneuver its way to Qaiserbagh through Muslim dominated areas like Aminabad and old city. 
 
The Gandhi scion and the National President of the Samajwadi Party will then go to Nakkhas Chowk, Ghantaghar where the road show will conclude. 
 
If Samajwadi spokesperson Rajendra Chowdhary is to be believed, the roadshow will showcase both the Congress and the Samajwadi Party as a single power. The events would be to show we are coming together and display ourselves as a united force for the state assembly elections, the Uttar Pradesh Cabinet minister was quoted as saying.

A joint poster with the slogan UP ko yeh saath pasand hai having the pictures of both Rahul and Akhilesh and their respective party symbols will also be released on the occasion. The tri-colour and red and green colours of both the parties are expected to be seen in the posters. 
 
Meanwhile, adequate security arrangements have been made for the road show which is expected to be a high-profile one. 
 
Putting all speculations to rest, the Congress and the Samajwadi Party last week on January 22 forged an alliance for the high-voltage Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. The Congress, which wanted to contest as many as 121 seats, has reportedly now settled for 105 seats. The development came after Priyanka Gandhis intervention ending the prolonged deadlock over entering into an alliance to counter the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the politically crucial state. 
 
The Congress is contesting 105 seats while the ruling Samajwadi Party is contesting 298 seats. Uttar Pradesh will be voting for a new state assembly in a seven-phase election. Voting in the state begins on February 11 and concludes on March 8. Counting of votes will be held on March 11.
