Here now come actual letters from actual readers! Only writers initials are used because you can write The Watchdog in confidence. So whats on your mind? 

Dear Watchdog: 

We receive several robocalls per day. I have gone to NoMoRobo.com, but it is not compatible with AT&T, my service provider. Are there any other ways to block these annoying calls? 

 T.F. 

Dear T.F.: 

Funny you mention this. Let me take this opportunity to share that AT&T has released a free call blocker application called A&T Call Protect. Its available to some wireless customers with iPhone or Android smartphones. The Watchdog hasnt tested it yet. Im hesitant. Why? See next letter. 

 

Dear Watchdog: 

AT&Ts new feature is AT&T Call Protect. The attached is the Terms of Service for Call Protect. Look at paragraph 2.7. I dont see why they need my contacts on my cellphone. I value my privacy and pass on apps that collect too much of my personal data, especially without my consent. If newsworthy, I would appreciate your Watchdog Nation review of this Call Protect app and share that. 

 R.N. 

Dear R.N.: 

Im with you. If an app requests access to my contacts, I say, No way. You raise an important point, R.N. Definitely newsworthy. Thanks for sharing  and I followed up. 

I asked AT&Ts Texas spokesman Dale Ingram about this invasion of privacy. His response: To best block unwanted calls, and enable valid calls to get through and be recognized by the customer, it is important for the AT&T Call Protect app to have access to their address book. And it is important to note the address book data is used by the AT&T Call Protect app on the device only and is not further shared or collected. 

Ill point out that everybodys favorite blocker  NoMoRobo.com  doesnt require your contacts to shut down scammers. NoMoRobo worries about the number calling you, not the numbers in your address book. Good catch, R.N. Think twice before trying Call Protect. 

 

Dear Watchdog: 

I am asking about ways to get off mailing lists. I have been besieged and buried this year. I think I got about 13 stopped, but I have many I need to delete forever. Is there a reliable address I can contact to get this stopped? Any help you might offer will be much appreciated. 

 C.G. 

Dear C.G.: 

You didnt say whether these were emails or postal mailings that annoy you so much. If its emails, its easiest to right click on the email and instruct that any future emails from that address or domain go directly to your spam or trash folder. 

If its postal mailings clogging your mailbox, you can do a search for DMA Choice and register with DMAchoice.org to better control your mail flow. The service, offered by the Data & Marketing Association, promises to help you start getting the mail you want  and stop getting the mail you dont. 

 

Dear Watchdog: 

My credit card was used to order auto parts on four occasions. I realize I am not responsible for the charges, but these thieves are getting away with stealing millions by spreading their purchases across all of our credit cards. Is there anything that can be done to apprehend these criminals? 

 B.L. 

Dear B.L.: 

If you find anyone who cares, let me know. That would be unusual and worthy of a story. Nobody cares. Everybody is a victim. Its an easy crime to get away with. 

 

Dear Watchdog: 

My complaint involves a car purchase. We were promised certain features, but the vehicle didnt contain them. The sales manager dismissed that as not being important. While skeptical of any salesperson whose living depends on commissions, I never expected this level of gross deception. I never expected the parent corporation to be so callous in its corporate stance to adopt a do-nothing attitude. I need your help. 

 R.R. 

Dear R.R.: 

My suggestion. Write a letter to the car companys CEO. Youll have to Google name and address. Send it by certified mail. Tell the CEO you talked to me and before he writes anything he wanted me to give you a chance to fix this. 

Say, Heres something I know youd want to know about a representative of your company. Tell the CEO exactly what you want to make your situation better. Let me know what happens. 

Six weeks later, R.R. writes back. 

Dear Watchdog: 

I want to thank you very much for your very helpful advice. I proposed paying the difference between the two models, which I think is very fair. Although the CEOs office first tried to say their hands were tied, I stressed very emphatically how this damaged the carmakers reputation. It worked! We now have a new car with all the promised safety features. 

Voila. Another victory for Watchdog Nation. Amazing what we can accomplish with the right words to the right people.
