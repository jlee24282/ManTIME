<TITLE>VSSA grad Aaron Blunck wins X Games ski superpipe</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Last week, Crested Buttes Aaron Blunck called Aspen his home away from home. Best friends with local stars Torin Yater-Wallace and Alex Ferreira, hes spent a lot of time in the area. 
 
Like his friends, Blunck is an X Games Aspen veteran competing in the ski superpipe. Unlike his friends, hes never found success in competition. In fact, he had never executed a complete run before Fridays finals at Buttermilk. 
 
Ive dreamed of this as a little kid and I cannot be more stoked, the 20-year-old Blunck said. To win here is unbelievable. Im so stoked right now. I cannot actually believe it. Its always been a dream to me, but to actually do it is unbelievable. 
 
In a fast pipe that caused everyone trouble, Blunck put together a spectacular second run of 84.66 to win X Games gold, an absolute Cinderella in a competition that included three-time gold medalists Kevin Rolland and David Wise. 
 
Bluncks previous best finish in Aspen had been seventh place. 
 
It was icy and it was really fast. With that, everybody was going so big, which makes them get a little bit closer to the deck, Blunck said. Second run, I knew what I had to do and I jumped in, and right before I dropped in I kind of got in the zone and I was just feeling so good. 
 
Blunck wasnt a factor after the first run. A 71 from Canadas Noah Bowman was the best anyone could muster in the icy superpipe, Frances Benoit Valentins 58 being second best and Yater-Wallaces 36.66 a surprising third. 
 
But, midway through the second and final round, New Zealands Miguel Porteous laid down what was then the best run of the night, his 81 vaulting him into first place. Only a run later, Blunck surpassed him with his 84.66. 
 
I cant believe it. Im still shaking, the 17-year-old Porteous said. Im unbelievably humbled to come back and to come away with the second, I cant even fathom it. Im so stoked. 
 
It was Porteous first career X Games podium. Bowman took bronze. 
 
Yater-Wallace, who had two promising runs that each ended with late crashes, finished sixth. Ferreira was a late scratch from the competition. 
 
Coming into the last few X Games I felt a lot of stress, Blunck said. Im also just skiing and realizing its all just for fun. Its not just about the competition or the money anymore. I ski because I love it, and thats what has really changed for me. 
 
Rolland, last years gold medalist, took eighth.
