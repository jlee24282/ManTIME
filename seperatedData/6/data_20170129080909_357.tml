<TITLE>Turning his focus to parents, Modi said they should accept</TITLE>

their children as they are and not burden them with expectations. 
 
"There is a lot of discussion about the weight of students' school bag. It seem that the weight of parents' expectations is more. Expectation is at the root of problems while acceptance gives you an opportunity to improve things and look for new ways," he said, asking them to spend quality time with their children. 
 
Underlining the need to avoid competing with others, he said it leads to jealousy, disappointment and complacency while if one competes with oneself it leads to stronger resolve, introspection and inspiration. 
 
Highlighting the need to play sports even as they prepare for exams, he said, "Letter 'P' is for preparation and 'P' is also for play. The person who plays shines. Proper rest, adequate sleep and physical exercise should be there... 
 
"A happy mind is the secret for a good marksheet. When you are tense, knowledge takes a back seat. Do not let that happen." 
 
He asked students to strike a balance between their mission and ambition, saying if they do it, good marks will follow them. 
 
The burden of scoring good marks at times prevents them from taking the right path, he said, noting that people never inquire about how much marks a doctor or a lawyer has scored when they go to them. 
 
In a lighter vein, Modi said parents and teachers may not like his emphasis on the need for relaxing and playing. 
 
"Whatever I say, it does not mean that you keep sleeping or your family will blame me when the marksheet comes... You should not allow whatever I have said to become a burden. Do it if possible or leave it."
