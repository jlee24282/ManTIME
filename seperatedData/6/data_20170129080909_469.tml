DUBAI, 29th January, 2017 (WAM) -- Ducab, the Middle Easts leading manufacturer of high quality cables and cabling products, today announced its participation at Tawdheef 2017 to present Emirati youth with the opportunity to contribute to the growth and success of the industrial sector in the UAE. At the event, Ducab will be offering a number of exciting career opportunities in addition to professional training programs. 
 
Speaking about the event, Mona Fekri, General Manager of Human Resources at Ducab, highlighted the importance of the exhibition in providing the opportunity for organisations to meet with talented Emirati professionals from prominent universities across the region and help them understand the nature of work and the careers available. "Attracting competent and qualified Emirati talent is one of the key pillars of Ducabs human resources strategy. The Tawdheef recruitment exhibition presents the perfect opportunity to meet with these talented professionals and communicate the importance of building the industrial sector, one of the fundamental pillars of the UAE economy", said Mona Fekri. "With the recruitment and training of new and young talent, we look forward to coming alongside the wise leadership of the UAE Government in achieving the vision of a diverse and integrated economy led by the industrial and manufacturing sectors and built on innovation and creativity." 
 
The UAE industrial sector, which contributed 14 percent to GDP, is forecast to expand and contribute 20 percent in 2021. The UAE seeks to attract more than US$70 billion in industrial investments by 2025, which will help increase the share of the industrial sector in the country's GDP to 25 percent in the same year. 
 
Ducab aims to strengthen the participation of Emirati youth in the industrial sector by equipping them with the required professional expertise through its vocational training and scholarship programmes. The company has a robust Emiratisation programme in place that has led to the successful recruitment and retention of talented UAE nationals. 
 
Tawdheef 2017 is taking place at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre from the 30th January to 1st of February.
