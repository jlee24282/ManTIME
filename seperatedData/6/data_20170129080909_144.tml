The Friars would build as much as a six point lead, 71-65, before the Gold Eagles would rally to get as close as one point, 71-70, with 2:28 left. 

From there, Kyron Cartwright would score seven straight points for the Friars to give them a 78-72 lead with 47 seconds left to play in the game. 

PC would miss free throws down the stretch allowing the Golden Eagles to have a chance.

Friars Start Strong

Leading 22-20 with 5:44 to play, the Friars would go on an 11-5 run to take a 33-25 lead following two free throws from Holt.

After Fazes grabbed a defensive rebound, freshman Maliek White drove to the middle of the paint, pulled up and hit a spinning jumper to give the Friars a 40-32 lead at the half.
