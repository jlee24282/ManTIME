The figure has remained in the above 2,000 evacuees range since last night. 
 
State Health and Environment Committee chairman Datuk Ayub Rahmat said the Segamat district has the most evacuees with 1,262 people from 337 seeking shelter at 24 centres at noon. 
 
This was followed by Tangkak with 609 people from 156 families in seven relief centres and Muar with 433 people from 123 families in six relief centres. 
 
In a related matter, Ayub said the Johor Disaster Medical Response Vehicle (JDMRV), which was launched by the Health Ministry to help in flood relief efforts, has been deployed to Segamat to provide medical services to flood victims. 
 
He said the three-tonne four-wheel drive truck manufactured by DRB-HICOM Defence Technologies Sdn Bhd was mobilised in Kampung Spang Loi and Kampung Mensudut, Segamat on Friday and proceeded to Kampung Tekam today. 
 
The fair weather here and in most parts of Johor continued for the fourth day bringing relief to many people in flood-hit areas. 
 
However, four roads in Segamat district remained closed, including Jalan Pogoh-Tekam as flood waters flowed downstream through Sungai Muar. 
 
Jalan Muar-Labis also remained closed.
