<TITLE>HBOs Supervillainous Young Pope</TITLE>
<TEXT>
b L. Brent Bozell III and Tim Graham, : In a conversation about homosexuality a few years ago, a Catholic priest made a powerful observation. Do you realize Heaven is full of gay saints? he said. His point: The homosexual condition exists; the exercise is sinful. Those honoring Gods law carry an especially heavy cross through life, and for that they are rewarded with paradise.

The atheist cannot separate the sinner from the sin because he doesnt acknowledge the existence of sin. What to do about those who condemn the sin but also demand that the sinner be loved? The atheist hates Christianity, and Christianity-haters have no problem purposely distorting the Churchs teachings while slandering its leaders if it will advance their agenda.

Enter HBO and The Young Pope. In the fourth episode of a ten-episode series, the implausible American pontiff Lenny Belardo, or Pope Pius XIII, proposes to Cardinal Angelo Voiello, a reformist prelate who wants to manipulate the eponymous young pope, that all the gay priests be drummed out of the priesthood.

But the conversation continues to smear the Catholic hierarchy. The cardinal protests, Then what becomes of mother churchs capacity for forgiveness? Pope Pius shoots back: With our abuse of forgiveness, weve become a laughingstock, Your Eminence. As unreliable as some miserable little third-world country. That insult clearly wasnt good enough for the scriptwriter, since the cardinal replies in kind, saying, With your methods, on the other hand, we are likely to become as reliable as, say, North Korea.

So, take your pick. In HBOs opinion, the worlds largest church is either a miserable little third-world country or North Korea, which is pretty much the same thing, the latter with a heavy layer of Marxist totalitarianism.

This malignant Holy Father doesnt recognize any rules. Theres really nothing Catholic about him. In the first episode, when he goes ostensibly to confess his sins to a priest, he demands that the priest tell him the sins of other confessors, which is a confidence, or seal, priests are not supposed to violate. Then, still during confession, he asserts to God: I do not believe in you. I dont believe youre capable of saving me from myself. When the priest expresses grave concern over this tidbit, he clarifies, Im saying I dont believe in God. Then he insists, I was joking.
