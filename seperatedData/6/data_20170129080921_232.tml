<TITLE>3 Indian channels telecast to continue in Bangladesh</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Telecast of three Indian channels -- Star Jalsha, Star Plus and Zee Bangla -- will continue in Bangladesh. 

The High Court today rejected a petition filed seeking its directive on the government to stop telecast of the three Indian television channels here. 

The HC bench of Justice Md Moinul Islam Chowdhury and Justice JBM Hassan delivered the verdict after hearing the petition. 

Syeda Shahin Ara Laily, a Supreme Court lawyer, submitted the petition to the HC in September 2014, saying programmes broadcast by the three channels left adverse impact on social and cultural life of Bangladeshi people. 

Education of the students and regular activities of housewives are being hampered due to watching the channels' programmes, she mentioned in the petition.
