<TITLE>Germany's Social Democrats set to back Schulz as Merkel challenger</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By our dpa-correspondent and Europe Online     Berlin (dpa) - The leaders of Germanys Social Democrats are set to back former European Parliament president Martin Schulz as the SPDs challenger to Chancellor Angela Merkel in Septembers national election. 
The leaders decision on Sunday at a conclave in Berlin to formally nominate Schulz as the SPD standard-bearer as well as party chief comes after the announcement by Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel that he was standing down as party chairman. 

The left-leaning partys hopes for the September election have been raised by the prospects of Schulz taking over, after Gabriel trailed badly behind Merkel in opinion polls. 

A poll published on Friday showed support for the SPD as having jumped by 3 percentage points since the start of the year to 24 per cent. 

If Germans could directly elect their chancellor, Merkel would garner 44 per cent of the vote, while Schulz would pick up 40 per cent, according to the survey drawn up by pollsters Forschungsgruppe Wahlen for the German public broadcaster ZDF. 

The survey of 1303 voters found that SPDs supporters were upbeat about their new chancellor candidate with 71 per cent saying they hoped that Gabriels decision to stand aside for Schulz would improve the partys chances. 

However, the poll also underlined the uphill battle that Schulz faces in turning around his partys political fortunes and even trying to topple Merkel, who is making a bid for a fourth term on September 24. 

The ZDF survey showed the SPD is still 12 percentage points behind Merkels conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian-based Christian Social Union (CSU) allies, which mustered 36 per cent of the vote. 

After this weekends nomination, the SPD is expected to then formally back the 61-year-old Schulz at a conference set for the middle of March.
