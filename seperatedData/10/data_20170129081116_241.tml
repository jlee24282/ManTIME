Please, Dont Touch Anything is a cryptic, brain-racking puzzle game about bathroom breaks, screwdrivers and nuclear explosions.\r 
Covering for a colleague taking a bathroom break, you find yourself in front of a mysterious panel which only component is a red button. And since youve clearly been instructed not to touch anything, the only thing you want to do now is pushing the damn button.\r 
\r 
Push it and expect to be held liable for any unintended aftermath. And there will be many.\r
