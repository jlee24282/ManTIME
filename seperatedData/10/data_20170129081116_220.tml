And the winner is ... 2017! 
 
We made the record books last week. It has been warm and wet start to 2017. According to the National Weather Service records for Toledo, we broke the record for the most consecutive days above freezing for the month of January, beating the previous record of eight days set back in 1998. 
 
Heres a bit of my favorite meteorology geek data: The last time we felt the temperature drop below freezing was Jan. 16, where we were at 20 degrees for the daytime high. Also, according to the National Weather Service, January made the top 10 of the wettest months on record for Toledo with 4.4 inches of rain.

Thats because the warmer temperatures have caused the frozen soil to thaw. According to Michigan State University, soil temperatures in southeast Michigan near the state line have been hanging just above the freezing mark all month. At a 4-inch depth, they have been fluctuating from 38.7 degrees to 32.5 degrees. 
 
Spring-like weather has been easy on the pocketbook but has taken some of our plants out of their winter slumber. If you had a chance to take a look at some of the plants around your yard, you might see some of the early bloomers like forsythia and lilac already pushing their buds out on each branch. Some of the early blooming bulbs may also have some of their foliage peeking above the soil line. 
 
But now it is back to average temperatures around the freezing mark for the daytime high and overnight lows in the teens, with a bit of white stuff flying in the air. It may take a few weeks below zero to get the ground frozen solid again. So what will this warm January weather do to your plants? 
 
Amy Stone, Ohio State University Extension Agent for Lucas County, said, At this point there isn't a lot gardeners can do but wait and watch. She said many plants could see a bit of tip damage when the temps go back to average and the ground freezes again, but they will be able to survive the warm-up. 
 
Hobbyists and professionals who hunt for sugar maple trees and live near a sugar bush were watching the weather closely. Maple trees will start their sap flow when we get bright sun during the day with warmer temperatures and crisp nights. We didnt have exactly those conditions, but the warmer temperatures were tempting the trees to come out of dormancy. 
 
Stone said, Those that tap for maple syrup are very anxious, but at this point it is a wait-and-see. It might be a rough year for those with sugar bush. 
 
Stone continued: If gardeners have planted perennials, shrubs, and even trees last fall, keep your eyes open as temperatures fall and the ground freezes that there isnt any heaving of the root ball. The act of heaving can push root balls up and expose roots, and when temperatures drop  and they will  they could be exposed and there could be some winter injury. 
 
The warm-up isnt all bad. 
 
On the positive side, if silver maples bloom during a warm-up, the temperatures are sure to go down and will hopefully kill the flowers and therefore we won't have the fruit or samaras, said Stone. 
 
Spring isnt far off. Spring equinox is March 20, but hey, whos counting?
