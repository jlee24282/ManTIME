<TITLE>Rainbow trout coming back to Spring Mill Lake in March</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Its been 11 years since rainbow trout were stocked into Spring Mill Lake in Spring Mill State Park. That will change in March, when trout will be launched from a special tank truck into the water of the 26-acre lake.

Spring Mill Lake is now a good lake for stocking trout because of the dredging project that improved conditions for fish and angler alike. In 2006, the last year the trout were stocked at the lake, biologists had to punch holes in the weeds to allow the fish to find their way to deeper water from along the shoreline, according to Dave Kittaka, fisheries biologist with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources Division of Fish and Wildlife.

Fishing was difficult in that lake for any species, Kittaka said. But now that conditions have improved, hes hoping 750 8- to 10-inch rainbow trout will be placed in the lake.

We basically have a new lake with newfound depth, Kittaka said. The water that comes out of those caves, Twin and Shawnee, keeps the water temperature cold.

Kittaka said the trout are currently housed at the East Fork State Fish Hatchery in Daviess County, where they will continue to live until they are placed into Spring Mill and three other Indiana lakes  Maple Avenue Nature Park in Terre Haute, Airline Pit in Greene-Sullivan State Forest and Midland Lake in Hillenbrand Fish and Wildlife Area. There will also be stockings in other areas across the state, he said.

These fish are what we call put-and-take trout, Kittaka said. We put them in the lake so people can catch them and take them home. He added that the likelihood of the trout reproducing is zero. But if any of the fish arent caught during the year, there is a good chance they will survive into the next year.

One of the concerns with stocking rainbow trout into Spring Mill Lake is that a family of river otters now lives there. Otters eat fish, lots of fish.

Although the otters may eat some of the rainbow trout, Kittaka said its more likely the otters will eat the fish that are easiest to catch. Thats not rainbow trout. The likely dinner for the otters are the bottom-feeding fish found in the lake, suckers and common carp. These fish, known as rough fish, are plentiful because people dont fish for them and are easier to catch.

In contrast, the rainbow trout will be in the water column of the lake and have more room to escape.

Rainbow trout will be stocked into Spring Mill Lake for the next five years, Kittaka said. Dredging the lake was just the first step in making the lake more of an attraction to visitors. There are also plans for a new boat ramp, fishing docks and more.

Fishermen and women at Spring Mill Lake will be asked to fill out a fish survey to help state biologists better know how many trout have been caught, Kittaka said. The hope is the survey will give them a better idea of interest in fishing at the lake as well as how many fish have been taken.

Anyone who wants to fish for trout in Indiana must have an $11 trout and salmon privilege stamp as well as a fishing license. The stamps can be purchased anywhere fishing licenses are sold. The inland trout program is funded through the stamp funds. The daily bag limit for trout is five fish per day. Minimum size limit is 7 inches.
