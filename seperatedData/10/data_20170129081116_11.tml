My Iranian-American friend's father is in Iran right now for a visit. He's a green card holder. Under #MuslimBan , he can't come back.

The Academy criticises the ban 
 
The Academy has blasted President Donald Trumps travel ban branding it extremely troubling, reports PTI 
 
Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, who wrote and directed the 2017 Oscarnominated foreign language film The Salesman, would not be able to enter the US for the awards under Trumps recently enacted travel ban, reported Variety. 
 
The Academy celebrates achievement in the art of filmmaking, which seeks to transcend borders and speak to audiences around the world, regardless of national, ethnic, or religious differences. 
 
As supporters of filmmakers  and the human rights of all people  around the globe, we find it extremely troubling that Asghar Farhadi, the director of the Oscarwinning film from Iran A Separation, along with the cast and crew of this years Oscarnominated film The Salesman, could be barred from entering the country because of their religion or country of origin, statement released by the Academys official spokesperson read.
