<TITLE>How To Have Skin Like Kim K (Honestly)</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Gorgeous Skin By CosmeSurge  
Is there anything that makes you feel like you can conquer the world ( or at least manage that crazy mama schedule ) AND still feel gorgeous ? Well, yes actually there is. And it comes in the form of beautiful skin that radiates youth and shouts Ive had 8 hours sleep ( even if you havent ). 
 
CosmeSurge is the Middle Easts most trusted name in cosmetology and aesthetic medicine , treating patients from around the globe in their world-class facilities. With over 60 unique and innovative treatments, whether you want to go all out ( were talking liposuction, breast augmentation and reconstruction ) or are keen to try a few non-invasive treatments including Oxygen Facials, Hydra Facials, PRP or Botox and Fillers to help rejuvenate your skin ,these guys do it all in the most professional way. 
 
Scared? Dont be. Were not telling you to book a boob job or get a new nose ( unless you want to of course ): theres so much more to CosmeSurge. Just think of it as your one-stop-shop for everything cosmetic/aesthetic. And here comes the best part. Ever wondered how Kim Kardashian looks so flawless ? We just happen to know that her recent trip to Dubai included a visit to the CosmeSurge state-of-the-art set up in Dubai Marina where German trained Dermatologist Dr. Pegah Ceric-Dhdari treated psoriasis triggered by lack of sleep and stress ( recognise those, mamas? ). And if its good enough for Kim, its most definitely good enough for us . 
 
If you want to know more or youre keen to book an appointment then visit the CosmeSurge Clinic, Dubai Marina, 33/F, Al Habtoor Business Tower, opposite Habtoor Grand Hotel
