<TITLE>Australian Open 2017 - Roger Federer vs Rafael Nadal guide</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The 17-time Grand Slam champion saw off the world number four 7-5, 6-3, 1-6, 4-6, 6-3 in three hours and five minutes and will face either Rafael Nadal or Grigor Dimitrov in Sunday's final . 
 
Roger Federer reached his sixth Australian Open final by winning the second five-set match against Stan Wawrinka. They also met in the Australian Open semi-finals in 2014, with Nadal winning each time . Nadal won the first two sets, before Federer came roaring back to take the next two on a tiebreak. 
 
The break points continued to come thick and fast in the third set, Nadal converting his third and Dimitrov his fourth to keep the set on serve. 
 
The unexpected reprise of one of tennis's great rivalries will be their ninth meeting in a major final, the most between any two players in the post-1968 Open era. In a sport where individual match-ups matter so much, Nadal ticks all the boxes, and despite Nadal's exertions from an epic against Grigor Dimitrov on Friday, and despite an extra day's rest for Federer , it is impossible to not have Nadal as the favourite going into Sunday's clash. 
 
Most of us thought the days of the Williams sisters playing against each other in Grand Slam finals were over. 
 
For all their joy at reaching another Grand Slam final after serious injury problems - knee for Federer and wrist for Nadal - the importance of the match to both men can not be underestimated. In his march to the final, Federer defeated Nishikori and No. 10 seed Tomas Berdych before dispatching Mischa Zverev, who notably beat Murray in his previous match , in straight sets. 
 
Federer hadn't reached the final in Melbourne since 2010, and this marks his first Grand Slam final of any kind since 2015. 
 
It two tiebreaks and five sets for Federer to stop the charge from Nadal , but it would prove the last time the old dog would take down the young pup in a major. 
 
Federer was watching on with relish as his rival in Sunday's final was taken the distance in a draining physical battle. It was a great match ... 
 
Wawrinka struggled in the early exchanges and Federer sealed the first set with a break at 6-5 after his opponent's backhand was shown to be just out on review. Federer leads two sets to one. "A lot of time has gone by", Federer said. He went on to beat Federer in the final that year - his only title so far in Australia. 
 
For Nadal , it's his second five set win of the tournament (the first over top teenager Alexander "Sascha" Zverev in the third round) after losing five-setters in his last three hardcourt majors. Nadal re-took the lead in characteristic style, grinding down his opponent just by staying in the rally until a exhausted shot from Dimitrov found the net. 
 
The four-time Open champion entered the season-opening slam with only modest hopes - and certainly with no expectations to progress beyond the fourth round or quarter-finals. I played great. So was a great quality of tennis tonight. 
 
The baseline battles continued early in the fifth, Nadal incredibly holding from 15-40 down in the eighth game. 
 
IN the debate about who is the best male player of all time , Roger Federer generally gets the nod, thanks to his record haul of 17 Grand Slams.
