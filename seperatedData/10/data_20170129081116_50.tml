<TITLE>Column: Smart approaches, not strong-arm tactics, to jobs</TITLE>
<TEXT>
LONDON  
 
Ive actually been watching the early Trump presidency from London. (I would have gone to the moon, but I couldnt get a ride.) Even from here I have vertigo. 
 
My head is swirling from alternative facts, trade deals canceled, pipelines initiated, Obamacare in the Twilight Zone and utterly bizarre rants about attendance on Inauguration Day and fake voters on Election Day. Whatever this cost Vladimir Putin, hes already gotten his moneys worth  a chaos president. Pass the vodka. 
 
But moderate Republicans, independents and Democrats who opposed Donald Trump need to beware. He can make you so nuts  he can so vacuum your brains out  that you cant think clearly about the most important questions today: What things are true even if Trump believes them, and therefore merit support? And where can Democrats offer smarter approaches on issues, like jobs, for instance  approaches that can connect to the guts of working-class voters as Trump did, but provide a smarter path forward. 
 
Where Trumps instinct is not wrong is on the need to strike a better long-term trading arrangement with China. But I worry about his pugnacious tactics. I would be negotiating with Beijing in total secret. Let everybody save face. If he smacks China with America First, China will smack him with China First, and soon well have a good ol trade war. 
 
Where I think Democrats should focus their critique, and fresh thinking, is how we actually bring back more middle-class jobs. A day barely goes by without Trump threatening some company that plans to move jobs abroad or build a factory in Mexico, not America. If Trumps bullying can actually save good jobs, God bless him. But what Trump doesnt see is that while this may get him some short-term jobs headlines, in the long run CEOs may prefer not to build their next factory in America, precisely because it will be hostage to Trumps Twitter lashings. They also may quietly replace more workers with robots faster, because Trump cant see or complain about that. 
 
Trump wants to protect jobs, explained Gidi Grinstein, who heads the Israeli policy institute Reut. What we really need is to protect workers. 
 
You need to protect workers, not jobs, because every worker today will most likely have to transition multiple times to multiple jobs as the pace of change accelerates. So the best way you help workers is by ensuring that they are flexible  that they have the skills, safety nets, health care and lifelong learning opportunities to make those leaps and that they live in cities open to innovation, entrepreneurship and high-IQ risk-takers. 
 
The societal units protecting workers best are our healthy communities  where local businesses, philanthropies, the public school system and universities, and local government come together to support a permanent education-to-work-to-life-long-skill-building pipeline. 
 
Businesses signal to schools and colleges, in real time, the skills they need to thrive in the global economy, and philanthropies fund innovative programs for supplemental education and training. Schools also serve as adult learning and social service centers  and local and state governments support them all, including reaching out globally for investors and new markets. 
 
When Trump strong-arms a company to retain jobs but kills Obamacare without a credible alternative, he is saving jobs but hurting workers, because he is making workers less secure and less flexible. 
 
Another of Trumps jobs fallacies is that regulation always holds companies back. In some cases it does, and thoughtful deregulation can help. But Trumps argument that we must ignore climate science because steadily upgrading clean energy standards for our power, auto and construction companies kills jobs is pure nonsense. 
 
In sum, Democrats should and can take the language of strength away from Trump and own it themselves. They should be for strong workers, not strong walls; for building strong communities, not relying on a strongman to strong-arm employers; and for strong standards to create strong companies. Those would be my fightin words.
