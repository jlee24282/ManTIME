<TITLE>Fallout: New Vegas Developer Announces New RPG</TITLE>
<TEXT>
A fan-funding campaign for a follow-up to 2015's Pillars of Eternity, Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire, is now live. 
 
Obsidian Entertainment, the developer behind Fallout: New Vegas, South Park: The Stick of Truth, and the original Pillars of Eternity, launched the campaign on Fig . The campaign has an overall goal of $1.1 million USD. [ Update: The campaign goal was achieved in under 24 hours. The funding now stands at $1.5m at the time of writing.) 
 
According to Obsidian, Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire "improves upon the rich narrative, beautiful environments, and intricate, tactical combat" that helped make the first game a success. 
 
The sequel sees players return to the world of Eora, this time to explore the Deadfire Archipelago. Traveling "by land and sea," players move from island to island, exploring the environments and smoothing out relations between the locals, "trading companies, and bands of fierce pirates." 
 
Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart said the goal with Pillars of Eternity II is to improve "on what fans loved about the original while adding features our fans want to see," such as more freedom for players to explore the world. 
 
In our Pillars of Eternity review , we called it one of the best RPGs since Baldur's Gate. The crowd-funding campaign for Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire is live on Fig . The game is being developed for PC, Mac, and Linux.
