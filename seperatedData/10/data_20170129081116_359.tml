Key players Jordy Nelson, Davante Adams, Geronimo Allison and Morgan Burnett are active for the Green Bay Packers for their NFC Championship matchup against Atlanta. 
 
The Green Bay Packers arent healthy. 
 
But they are full strength. 
 
Receivers Jordy Nelson, Davante Adams and Geronimo Allison and safety Morgan Burnett are all active for todays NFC Championship Game here at the Georgia Dome. Nelson (ribs), Adams (ankle), Allison (hamstring) and Burnett (thigh) were all listed as questionable and potential game-time decisions. 
 
To protect the broken ribs sustained only two weeks ago against the Giants, Nelson has enlisted extra protection . Nelson was listed as limited participation on Wednesday and Thursday but not on Friday due to illness. Adams, Allison and Burnett did not practice on Wednesday or Thursday. 

Also active for Green Bay is cornerback Quinten Rollins, who missed the last two games with a concussion, and running back Christine Michael, who was added to the injury report on Saturday. 
 
Green Bays inactives are quarterback Joe Callahan, receiver Max McCaffrey, cornerback Herb Waters, fullback Joe Kerridge, running back James Starks, offensive tackle Kyle Murphy and defensive tackle Christian Ringo. Only Starks (concussion) is injured among that group. McCaffrey, an undrafted rookie, was promoted from the practice squad on Saturday and center J.C. Tretter (knee) was placed on injured reserve. 
 
The Falcons dont have any noteworthy names on their inactives list. Receiver Julio Jones (toe) will start, as expected.
