From hitting his first 3-point attempt to converting two alley-oop lay-ins to thriving at the line, Branson Combs had a career night on Saturday against arch-rival Mater Dei at the Kent Athletic Center. 
 
Combs finished 9-for-14from the floor, including 4-for-6 from 3-point range, and was 8-for-10 from the line in scoring a career-high 30 points in Memorials 79-65 victory. 
 
My first shot was a 3, said Combs, a 6-foot-2 sophomore guard. On the alley-oops, I got good passes from my teammates and we set some really good screens. When the first (three) went in, I got into a rhythm. I think I had a little more confidence than I normally would. 
 
Michael Lindauer hit Combs on a backdoor alley-oop to boost the Tigers lead to 41-20 with 3:23 left in the first half. On nearly an identical play, Logan Douglas found Combs for a backdoor alley-oop, to increase their margin to 46-23 with 2:02 showing. 
 
Dylan Penn complemented Combs with 24 points, going 10-for-12 from the stripe in a game plagued by fouls. After a tough 55-52 loss at Princeton on Friday, the Tigers rebounded nicely, improving to 9-7 overall and 1-3 in the Southern Indiana Athletic Conference. 
 
Princeton is a very good basketball team, said Memorial coach Rick Wilgus. Everybody looks at their record (7-10) and think Memorial laid an egg. Theyre a good team. We were down eight and had a chance to win. We carried that over into tonight against a good Mater Dei team. They compete. They keep coming at you. 
 
Sam Fulton scored 19 points and had six rebounds for Mater Dei (8-8, 0-4). 
 
Combs 3-pointer from the right wing and two free throws began a 14-1 surge that boosted the Tigers advantage to 27-13 with 7:34 left in the second period. Memorial appeared on the verge of a blowout win, but the Wildcats doggedly hung in there. Jules Weinzapfel hit a pair of foul shots to narrow the margin to 73-59 with 1:51 remaining in the game, but they could never close within single digits. 
 
Theyve got a nice team, Mater Dei coach Kurt Wildeman said of Memorial. They played well and shot it. We let it get away (late in the first quarter). 
 
The Tigers finished 22-for-39 from the field, a 56.4 percentage, and were 28-for-38 from the line. 
 
We kept battling, Wildeman said. The second half was all right. We played hard all the way. We have to work hard in practice to get better. 
 
Combs had 22 of his game-high point total in the first half. 
 
Branson plays hard, Wilgus said. Hes fun to watch when hes fundamental. This was a good win. I ask the guys: How good do you really want to be? We made a couple of steps forward tonight. 
 
Wildeman said he knew that Combs was a nice player entering the game. 
 
They have a lot of guys who can beat you, he said. 
 
At the other end, Memorials defense forced the Wildcats into 20 turnovers.
