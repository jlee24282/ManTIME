<TITLE>Jazz lose to the Big 3 of Memphis, 102-95</TITLE>
<TEXT>
SALT LAKE CITY (ABC4 Sports) - Zach Randolph, Marc Gasol and Mike Conley took turns carving up the Utah Jazz on Saturday night 
 
Randolph scored a season-high 28 points, Conley had 23 whileGasol added 18 and the Memphis Grizzlies beat the Jazz 102-95. 
 
"Needless to say, they were terrific," said Jazz head coach Quin Snyder. "Marc Gasol hurt us with more jump shots, Zach hurt us on the post. We did some things that were not intelligent and made it harder on ourselves. We just weren't disciplined.We were not a good defensive team tonight. If we're going to play defense like that, we're not going to win many games." 
 
Randolph bullied defenders in the post throughout the night and Gasol worked the Utah defense both inside and out, routinely hitting turnaround fade-away jumpers and going 4 of 5 on 3-pointers. 
 
The Grizzlies took a 52-43 lead into halftime after a 13-2 run gave Memphis a 10-point lead. Randolph had his way with the Jazz post defenders and scored 10 of his 14 first-half points in the second quarter. 
 
The Jazz shot just 26.3 percent from the field in the second quarter and never led in the second half. 
 
Conley helped keep the Jazz at bay in the fourth quarter and finished with 23. 
 
Rodney Hood led the Jazz with 20 points. 
 
"Any time we have breakdowns, it's because we're not talking to each other and we're not helping each other out," Hood said. :I think that's the biggest thing. It's tough to lose when you know you can do better on that end. So, we've just got to get back to the drawing board." 
 
"They have a lot of guys down there that are capable of putting up high numbers every night," said Jazz point guard George Hill, who had 16 points and 5 assists."They have good players and we've got to respect that, but a lot of breakdowns in coverages gave them some looks and they hit a lot of tough shots late in the shot clock also." 
 
Quin Snyder decided to rest starting power forward Derrick Favors. 
 
The Jazz could have moved into the 4th seed in the Western Conference with a victory, but instead remain a half game back of the L.A. Clippers. 
 
Utah next hosts Milwaukee Wednesday night.
