<TITLE>Summit girls, boys win XC Oregon Invitational</TITLE>
<TEXT>
MOUNT BACHELOR  Near-perfect conditions provided an ideal environment for what is viewed as a preview of next months Oregon Interscholastic Ski Racing Association state championships. 
 
The OISRA Northern and Southern leagues converged at Mt. Bachelor for the XC Oregon Invitational, and it was the last time skiers from both leagues competed against one another until the state meet, which is scheduled to begin Feb. 24. 
 
And on a sunny, warm day with firm snow, Summit put on quite the display. 
 
Liv Downing, Fiona Max and Isabel Max went 1-2-3 in the 5K freestyle nordic race, earning for the Storm girls a perfect six points to top the 10-team standings. Bend was second with 24 points, followed by Mountain View and Redmond Proficiency Academy, each with 47 points, and Hood River Valley with 53. Downing won by more than 10 seconds with a time of 13 minutes, 55.2 seconds. 
 
Will Lange and Samuel Schoderbek took first and second, respectively, in the boys race to help Summit win. Lange won in 12:29.2 and Schoderbek was second in 12:31.4  28.3 seconds ahead of the third-place finisher. Summit totaled nine points to beat Hood River Valley by 12. South Eugene was third with 29 points, followed by Bend with 43, and Mountain View and Ashland tied for fifth with 55 points apiece. 
 
Bends Gemma Munck took fifth in the girls race, just behind RPAs Sarah Kilroy. The Storm placed three additional skiers in the top 10, as Sadie Ann Gorman and Alexandra Heisler took sixth and seventh, respectively, while Estelle Hyde placed ninth. 
 
Ridgeviews Albert Hesse finished fourth in the boys competition, Summits Mario Cacciola and Niklas Sjogren took sixth and 10th, respectively, while Bend teammates Kailash Moore and Levi Schwarz placed 11th and 12th in the 88-skier field.
