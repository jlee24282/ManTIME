Do you have Dow 20,000 envy? 

Take heart, you might be richer than you think. 

You may have wished during all the hype over the Dow Jones industrial average hitting 20,000 that you had been buying stocks. 

But you may actually own stocks without knowing it. If you've been dutifully putting a little money into a 401(k) or other retirement fund at work without paying attention to where it goes, you may very well have a good chunk in the stock market. It's become common in the last couple of years for large companies with 401(k)s to simply route a little of every employee's paycheck into what's known as a target-date fund. And if you have one of these funds, you do own stocks and you've become a little richer as the stock market has soared 10 percent since Donald Trump was elected president. 

On average the stock market climbs 10 percent during an entire year, so making 10 percent in just a couple of months is unusual. During all of 2016, the stock market gained about 12 percent -- a very good year. 

So you've done well if you've been working at a place that's been putting your money in one of these funds for several months or years. Consider a worker who is now about 25, with a fund that is set up for a person who is going to retire in roughly 40 years. That fund might have the number 2055 in the name, because it's designed for a person retiring at around 65 years old -- give or take a couple of years. If you had $1,000 in one of those funds on the day of the presidential election, you'd likely have about $1,060 now, according to Morningstar. 

Over long periods of time, the impact of the stock market is even more pronounced. A person who had about $10,000 in one of these funds 10 years ago and then never added another penny would have over $18,000 now, according to Morningstar. 

How does this happen? 

If you pick a target-date fund on your own, or if your employer picks it for your workplace 401(k) based on the year you will approach retirement age, most of your money will be put into the stock market. 

At about age 25, about 80 percent of your money will be deposited into the stock market, because young people get the biggest bang for their buck in the stock market and can recover later if stocks become losers for a while. The other 20 percent goes into bonds.
