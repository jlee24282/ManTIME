<TITLE>James Cameron Thinks 'We've Moved on Beyond' Alien Franchise</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Aliens director James Cameron has shared his candid thoughts on the Alien franchise and questioned whether there was even a need to continue it when asked about the forthcoming Alien: Covenant, which opens this summer. 
 
"The franchise has kind of wandered all over the map," Cameron told Vulture . "Ridley [Scott] did the first film, and he inspired an entire generation of filmmakers and science-fiction fans with that one movie and there have been so many films that stylistically have derived from it, including my own Aliens, which was the legitimate sequel and, I think, the proper heir to his film. I sort of did it as a fanboy. I wanted to honor his film, but also say what I needed to say. After that, I don't take any responsibility." 
 
As for the franchise post-Aliens, "I don't think it's worked out terribly well. I think we've moved on beyond it. It's like, okay, we've got it, we've got the whole Freudian biomechanoid meme. I've seen it in 100 horror films since. I think both of those films stand at a certain point in time, as a reference point. But is there any validity to doing another one now? I don't know. Maybe. Let's see, jury's out. Let's see what Ridley comes up with." 
 
"Let me just add to that  and don't cut this part off, please  I will stand in line for any Ridley Scott movie, even a not-so-great one, because he is such an artist, he's such a filmmaker. I always learn from him. And what he does with going back to his own franchise would be fascinating." 
 
Meanwhile, Cameron will regain the screen rights to the Terminator film franchise in 2019, and reportedly wants Deadpool's Tim Miller to direct another installment/reboot. Cameron is also developing multiple sequels to his 2009 blockbuster Avatar, the highest-grossing film of all time.
