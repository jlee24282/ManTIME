About 500 people traipsed through the showroom and maintenance buildings of Witmers Equipment Inc. during the annual open house Saturday. Started in 1937 by Nelson Witmers grandfather, the business, on state Route 14 outside Washingtonville, is preparing to celebrate its 80th year in business. Witmers handles 25 different lines of agriculture and construction equipment, including names like Massey-Ferguson, Fendt, Versitile, Agco, Gleaner, Mustang and Great Plains. Above, 2-year-old Donovan Darkadakis of Canfield had a twinkle in his eye and a smile that stretched from ear to ear as he climbed around on a Massey-Ferguson tractor.
