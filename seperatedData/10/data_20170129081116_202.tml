<TITLE>Dewey Alfred Waddell</TITLE>
<TEXT>
, 68, of Leesburg, Florida passed away peacefully on Thursday, January 26, 2017 at home under hospice care, surrounded by his loving family and friends. Dewey was welcomed into heaven after a courageous 1 1/2 year battle against liver cancer. He was born in Springville, Alabama on March 23, 1948 to Milton Aubrey Waddell and Mary Imogene Rowe Waddell. He moved with his family to Leesburg at 2 years old, graduated from Leesburg High School in 1967, and later received his associates degree from Lake-Sumter Community College. On May 22, 1968 Dewey married the love of his life, Laura Margaret Woodward. They eloped to Cairo Georgia after a short courtship and without the consent of their parents. Lauras father was concerned about how they would make a living being so young. Dewey assured him they would live on love! Well, that they did, and it didnt take long until Dewey had gained his in-laws approval, love and admiration. With the help of Lauras parents, Dewey and Laura founded M&C Pipe and Supply, Inc in 1973. Together, Dewey and Laura created a family and circle of friends that were blessed by their endless generosity, joy for life, and immense love. Dewey was an adoring father to his daughter and son-in-law Deann and Tim Coop of St. Petersburg and his son and business partner Dewey Dal Waddell and his girlfriend Lisa Gasque Bell. He was affectionately known as Big Daddy to his six grandchildren: Brandon, Connor and Carson Coop; Trey and wife Kaitlyn, Tyler and Maggie Waddell; and his great granddaughter Allison Waddell. He was also known as Uncle Big Dew to his nieces and nephews, with whom he had very special relationships: Steve Waddell and wife Kathy of Graceville, Chris Waddell of Graceville, Kim Waddell of Leesburg, Dena McKenna and husband Mike of St. Petersburg, Robyn Mitchell and husband Royce of Edgewater, Eric Lackey and wife Natasha of Tampa, Charles and wife Kristin Struth of Destin, and Jessica Struth of St. Petersburg. He is also survived by his sister-in-law and brother-in-law Charlotte and Mike Struth and his loving and faithful companion Barnelia Woodward. He is preceded in death by Laura, his loving wife of 42 years, his parents, and his brother Steven Lynn Waddell. Dewey loved being surrounded by nature. Two of his favorite places to soak it all in were deep in the woods of Steinhatchee at Po Boys Hunt Camp and on the beaches of New Smyrna. He was a highly spiritual and peaceful man. People were drawn to his kind, gentle spirit and delighted in his lighthearted sense of humor. He dedicated his life to relationships. Dewey always saw the good in every human being he encountered. Whether it was an old schoolmate, a business acquaintance, or a stranger in a check-out line, he could make a connection. He had a collection of friends from every generation and walk of life and treasured each and every one. As one friend said, to know him was to love him. Memorial service will be held on Saturday February 4th at 2pm at St. James Episcopal Church, with a Reception immediately following at his son's home (Dal Waddell), 801 south 9th St., Leesburg. In lieu of flowers the family suggests contributions to the American Cancer Society (Americancancersociety.org/) or the American Diabetes Foundation (Donations Diabetes Org).
