<TITLE>Plane departs after long delay</TITLE>
<TEXT>
SQ286 was meant to depart for Singapore this afternoon but was forced to abort its departure at the last minute. 
    
A Singapore Airlines flight has finally departed from Auckland Airport following a lengthy delay due to a potential fault with the aircraft. 
 
The plane sat on the tarmac for more than seven hours before taking off around 9pm, meaning many of the 300 people onboard will miss their connecting flights in Singapore. 
 
However, passenger Gabriel Xie, who is heading to Tokyo with hiswife for their honeymoon,said most were fairly relaxed about the extra wait. 
 
"Everyone's pretty chilled actually, either getting boozed up or watching movies," he said, while the aircraft was still stuck on the tarmac. 
 
Xie said passengers appreciated the lengths staff were going to to make sure everyone was OK. 
 
"They're trying to arrange everything for connecting flights, but we'll have to confirm them once we arrive in Singapore," he said. 
 
"It's frustrating, but at the same time the crew is doing their best and the passengers are civilised, so it's not too bad." 
 
Flight SQ286 was supposed to depart at 1.30pm but aborteddue to potential issues with the nose wheel of the aircraft. 
 
Xie thought wind was buffeting the plane as it headed down the runway on its first attempt. 
 
"The plane was wobbly when we tried to take off, going from side to side," he said. 
 
However, the aircraft then came to a stop on the tarmac and had to be towed back to the terminal. 
 
"The captain said there's something wrong with the nose wheel," Xie said. 
 
The flight was initially rescheduled for a 5pm takeoff, but that was repeatedly pushed back. 
 
The Singapore Airlines office was contacted but refused to comment about the failed takeoff. 
 
The runway was "closed for a short time" about 3pm, possibly to remove debris, anairport spokesman said. 
 
One plane was diverted from Auckland Airport due to therunway closure. 
 
Emirates flight 406 from Melbourne was due to land at 3.20pmbut wasdiverted to the Ohakea New Zealand Defence Force base, near Bulls, the spokesman said. 
 
Locals in Ohakea remarked on Twitter it was unusual to see an Airbus A380 at the base. 
 
There were about 430 passengers on the Emirates flight, which arrived in Auckland just after 6pm. 
 
Meanwhile, Emirates flight 345 to Brisbane and Dubai was also delayed on the tarmac at Auckland Airport. 
 
It was supposed to depart at 6.10pm, but it'sunderstooda passenger on boardfell ill, and the flight eventually left at 7.55pm.
