<TITLE>EOCO Boss Justice Tsar Sacked</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The Executive Director of the Economic and Organised Crimes Office Mr. Justice Tsar Yao has been dismissed by President Akufo-Addo, Starrfmonline.com has gathered.

Information gathered by Starrfmonline.com indicates that the President is yet to appoint a substantive head of the agency specialized in monitoring and investigating economic and organised crime.

In June last year, Justice Tsar, who was one of the Deputy Executive Directors, was appointed Acting Executive Director to replace Biadela Kweku Mortey Akpadzi, whose contract had elapsed after his retirement.
