<TITLE>Pinewood overcomes height disadvantage to earn big victory</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Pinewood slayed another giant Saturday with a 66-54 victory over Salesian in the feature game of the Bentley Showcase at Bentley School in Lafayette. 
 
Salesian towered over the Panthers, especially at center where Pinewood had 5-foot-9 Klara Astrom guarding 6-5 Angel Jackson.  
 
Brianna Claros But Pinewood, with coach Doc Scheppler continually bellowing give help in the post, came out on top of that matchup with Astrom outscoring Jackson 15-5. 
Shes playing the best of anyone on the team, Scheppler said of Astrom. Shes our most physical and tough player, our only player who wants to brawl. Everyone else on the team is a basketball player relying on skill. 
 
Astrom had 13 of her points in the first half, using her quickness to get loose and knock down three 3-pointers.  
 
Those 13 points early were crucial because that was the part of the game where Salesian had the advantage.  
 
Pinewood trailed 19-11 at the end of the first quarter and after the Pride scored the first basket of the second quarter Pinewood found itself trailing by 10. 
 
But then Salesian, which shot 7 of 11 in the first quarter, started to miss and Pinewood quickly capitalized to get back in the game. Astroms third 3-pointer of the half brought the Panthers within 23-22 and it was still a one-point deficit at the half, 29-28. 
 
Early on Salesian focused on trying to go inside to Jackson. But when that brought little success the Pride started to go elsewhere. 
 
I just tried to keep pushing for position and boxing out and using my body to exploit her weaknesses, Astrom said. I tried to use my smaller size to get around her. 
 
Pinewood completely took over in the third quarter, outscoring Salesian 18-5. The Panthers went on a 13-0 run to start the quarter.  
 
Akayla Hackson hit a 3-pointer to get it started and was fouled. She missed the free throw, but Pinewood ran down the offensive rebound and Mikaela Topper nailed another 3. Instead of a four-point play, it was a six-point possession to start the third quarter. 
 
Hackson made two foul shots, and then Brianna Claros hit a 3-pointer in transition as the gym erupted. Two free throws by Topper concluded the run with Pinewood up 41-29. 
 
All the momentum was on Pinewoods side and Salesian (15-6) never recovered. Another 9-0 run extended a 44-34 lead to 53-34. 
 
Claros led Pinewood with 20 points. She made two 3-pointers, one 2-pointer on a drive, and went 12 of 14 at the foul line, 8 of 8 in the fourth quarter when Salesian was reduced to fouling Pinewoods primary ball-handler. 
 
Hannah Jump, Pinewoods leading scorer on the season, had a hard time getting untracked. But she made two 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to finish with 10 points. 
 
Hannah was struggling, then she knocks down two 3s in the second half, Scheppler said. When youre the best shooter in California you keep shooting because you know the ball is going in. 
 
Pinewood (17-2) returns to action Tuesday at Eastside Prep. 
 
I love my team, Scheppler said. These girls are going to fight and rise up to any challenge.
