<TITLE>Life as a pro-athlete stylist: Suiting up Brock Osweiler, Alex Smith and more</TITLE>
<TEXT>
When quarterback Brock Osweiler wanted to give the 22 guyson the Houston Texans offensive line custom suits as a dual Christmas gift and thanks for protecting him during the 2016 season, Paige Hutt was unfazed. It was a largeorder for the stylist and custom clothier, but it wasnt the first time shed been asked to outfit a bunch of really big and tall men. 
 
Shedalready done four similar projects for other players, including former Broncos punter Britton Colquitt and Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith. 
 
Requests like this comewith the territory. Hutt has been making custom suits for seven years and currently works out of Windsor for b.spoke , a California-based clothier. Although she counts a couple of businessmen on her roster, her clientele is mostly professional athletes from a range of sports.

Its not something Iwas specifically seeking out, Hutt said of her niche market. It just kind of worked out that way, but its a small, small world.

Hutt visits a client at his home or office  in the case of the Texans, their locker room. She asks pointed questions about a clients career, lifestyle, body type and color preferences. She goes over his suit needs, existing wardrobe and price points. (B.spoke suits start around $1,295.) Onehour and 28 measurements later, Hutthas what she needs. 
 

 
After sending the measurements and patterns to a factory, Hutt is walking back to the client four or five weeks later with clothing in hand. 
 
Theres always an education process for both style-wise and fit-wise, Hutt said of the athletes she works with who typically areused to off-the-rack suits tailored  maybe  after the fact. 
 
Its always funny having an athlete, she continued. On their very, very first custom suit, you can just see it on their face, Oh my God, this is so fitted. They kind of do a double glance. Oh my god, this looks so good.' 
 
She typically warns athletes that clothes may fit more snugly thansuits off the rack. But a month afterdelivering an athletes first custom suit,Hutt typically receives a call filled with enthusiastic thank yous. 
 
Most are super eager to be able to wear something other than their sweatpants, Hutt said. 
 
For teams such as the Texans and Broncos that require players to dress sharp for away games, its a chance to one-up each other, she said. 
 
There always is a competition when guys want to be fresh, said Omar Bolden, a former Broncos safety and punt returner. 
 
Bolden met Hutt in the fall of 2014, whenColquitt gifted the special teams custom sportcoats during a particularly good run of play. Bolden, now a free agent, had always been interested in fashion but that was his first time having a custom coat. Previously, hed buy one from Mens Warehouse and have it tailored. 
 
Ijust absolutely loved the way it fit, Bolden said of the b.spoke coat. Its completely different when the garment actually started from nothing. 
 
Bolden said the five blazers and suits designed by Hutt are his favorites among the 12 he owns.

Not everyone can afford custom suits and there is no shame in getting a suit off the rack, he said. But if someone wanted to go custom, he advised that they establish a relationship with a tailor or stylist. 
 
Its more about the relationship and the chemistry I have with Paige than the custom suiting, Bolden said. I can get the custom suiting anywhere. 
 
The football player said he tries to push the envelope with his fashion and Hutthelps him do it. B.spoke has more than 50,000 fabrics for clients to consider, which can be overwhelming, so Hutt will help hone down on something within the customerswheelhouse, but still stretches his boundaries. 
 
I find that with my athletes, theyre basic like, Paige, we trust you.Iknow who you dress and they look good,  Hutt said. They leave most of the styling up to me rather than really picking out their fabrics. Some clients and athletes really love that and others have just seen what Ive done in the past and leave it up to me. 
 
Client Sean Withrow, a Denver investment consultant,described Hutts role as similar to an interior designer. You may walk in asking for one thing, but then she offers other available options that change your mind. 
 
Withrow has worked with about six other custom tailors previously but has stuck with Hutt. In his line of work, he said its important to make the right impression and not wear the same ill-fitting suit as competitors. 
 
Withrow says hes gone to Nuggets games and can tell which coaches and staffwork with Hutt  theyre the ones that are a little better dressed. Though his personal style doesnt always align with that of professional athletes, Withrow said Hutts clientele is an endorsement of her work. 
 
You can certainly argue that most of these folks could afford to buy these clotheswherever they wanted to, he said. The fact theyre working with her speaks highly of the way she works with clients and the quality of the clothing her company provides.
