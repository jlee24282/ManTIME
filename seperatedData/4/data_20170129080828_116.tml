<TITLE>Octavia Spencer sent letters to idol Michael Jackson</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Octavia Spencer used to send fan mail to Michael Jackson.

The 46-year-old actress enjoyed writing letters to various celebrities when she was younger and she was thrilled when she received a poster in response to a note she'd sent her 'Thriller' hitmaker idol.

She said: "When I was a kid I would write to lots of people.

"I remember I wrote to Michael Jackson. I think I got back one of the posters that was on my wall."

Despite her own fame, the 'Hidden Figures' actress still gets star struck and believes the day she stops being in awe of other people is the day she should change careers.

She said: "I'm still star struck all the time. I met Steven Spielberg, who I've idolised since I was a 13-year-old kid. And Oprah Winfrey.

She told Empire magazine "I think when I stop being star struck it's time to get out of this business."

When Octavia goes to the cinema, she refuses to leave until the end of the movie, even if she isn't enjoying it.

She said: "I don't [walk out]. If I've spent my money and bought my popcorn, you've got me.

"If people took the time to make it, then I'll stick with it to the end."

And the actress will drop everything if one of her favourite movies is on TV, even if it affects her other commitments.

She said: "There are three I've seen more than any other, 'The Color Purple, 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'Driving Miss Daisy'.

"No matter when they're on, I'm going to have to watch them and I'm going to be late."
