Men Think You Are A Sex Addict When You Satisfy Them In Bed  Bridget Amos  
By Ayo Onikoyi 
 
On-the-rise Yoruba actress, Bridget Amos has clear ideas about what she wants in her career and she seems to know exactly how to go about getting them. In one past interview with Potpourri, the busty Kwara State-born beauty said she loves setting certain standards for herself, and unlike many of her peers, she would produce only one film per year. 
 
As cocky and as sure of herself as she is, Bridget seems to have issues with matters of the heart. In a recent post on Instagram, the actress vented her frustrations with loving a man and satisfying one.

What do you really want? So complicated and confusing to please, she wrote, questioning men on her list. 
 
If you try to please them, you are cheap; if you make love to them you are a love peddler; if you dont, you are playing hard to get; if you show them love you are too emotional. If you give them attention, you are bugging them, and if you dont, you are with other men. If you dress sexy you are attracting other men, if you dont, you are awkward and local. If you cook; wash their clothes, you are desperate of getting married, if you dont , you are not a wife material 
 
Continuing: If youre independent you are chasing other men; if you are dependent you are a liability. If you try to satisfy them in bed you are a sex addict; if you dont, you are making sex boring. If you get pregnant you want to trap them down; if you dont, you have damaged your womb. If you are beautiful, you cant stay with one man; if you are not, you are not up to the standard; if you ask for money you are too demanding and if you dont, you are forming. Then, she hits the nail on the head, they think we cant do without them. At times, I dont think they know what they want.
