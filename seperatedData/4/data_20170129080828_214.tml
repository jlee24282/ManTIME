<TITLE>LISTEN: Community Peer Mentor Project Seeking More County Durham Volunteers</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Kind-hearted residents that are keen to give back to the community are being sought to help vulnerable and isolated people. 
 
The Community Peer Mentor project is growing bigger and bigger and therefore is seeking more volunteers in the Spennymoor, Newton Aycliffe and Ferryhill areas; the scheme has been a great success in the Darlington and Bishop Auckland areas following its launch in September last year. 
 
Free-of-charge training will take place in February and March this year, so that volunteers can gain new skills, interests and experiences leading to new qualifications. 
 
Jim Cunningham is the Project Leader and tells us how successful it's been so far: 
 
Durham Police, Crime and Victims' Commissioner (PCVC) Ron Hogg said: "This project is really going from strength to strength which is fantastic news. 
 
"This means that even more people in our communities who feel vulnerable or isolated can receive the support they need to improve their lives." 
 
There are two training courses available, both of which will be held at Spennymoor Community Fire Station. 
 
Both courses offer the same training content, just with different time durations to meet different people's needs: 
 5 week Course - 01FEB - 01MAR17 - every Wednesday night. The training lasts 2  hours starting at 1800hrs (6pm);  2 day Course - 22 - 23MAR17 - this will run from 0930 to 1630hrs. You will be required to attend both days.  
No previous experience in volunteering or supporting people is needed as training is provided. 
 
There is no upper age restriction and relevant travel expenses will be paid. 
 
Once trained, Community Peer Mentors will work in pairs with individuals to find the reasons behind their behaviour or why they feel the way they do and encourage them to find ways to get the help and support they need. 
 
Existing volunteers within this unique project who have completed their training have found it a rewarding experience to help others when they need it the most. 
 
Applicants are invited to contact Jim Cunningham for more information or to register their interest on Tel: 0300 003 1818 or email: jim.cunningham@restorativehub.org.uk.
