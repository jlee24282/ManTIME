WASHINGTON  The Department of Homeland Security will continue to enforce all of President Trumps Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. President Trumps Executive Orders remain in placeprohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. President Trumps Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over Americas borders and national security.

Approximately 80 million international travelers enter the United States every year. Yesterday, less than one percent of the more than 325,000 international air travelers who arrive every day were inconvenienced while enhanced security measures were implemented. These individuals went through enhanced security screenings and are being processed for entry to the United States, consistent with our immigration laws and judicial orders.

The Department of Homeland Security will faithfully execute the immigration laws, and we will treat all of those we encounter humanely and with professionalism. No foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States or to demand immigration benefits in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security will comply with judicial orders; faithfully enforce our immigration laws, and implement President Trumps Executive Orders to ensure that those entering the United States do not pose a threat to our country or the American people.
