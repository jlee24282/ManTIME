<TITLE>SHEA WILSON: Facts matter: Truth better than alternative</TITLE>
<TEXT>
For some reason, my doctor was unwilling to accept the alternative facts I offered Thursday in response to the numbers on his office scales. With the responses from the White House earlier in the week and George Orwells 1984 atop Amazons best seller list almost six decades after it was first published, I figured I would give newspeak and doublespeak a whirl. My doctor looked at me the way I look at President Trumps counselor Kellyanne Conway. 
 
Though I would prefer the alternative fact that Im fit and thin be true, it is not. And that is apparent. I can see and those who know me can see the truth. To claim and insist otherwise when the truth is clear would be foolish. 
 
So then, why would Trump and his parrots insist certain things are true when it is apparent they are not? In the face of facts  well documented non-partisan facts  why would you continue to promote and defend lies? 
 
Conway used the Orwellian language on Meet the Press while defending White House Press Secretary Sean Spicers claim that Trumps inauguration attracted the largest audience ever. Aerial photos and other methods of crowd calculation show previous inaugurations had greater attendance. The lower attendance was noted at Trumps event because it was apparent to anyone who looked at photo comparisons. 
 
If team Trump had said nothing, it is likely that the report would have received little more than a mention in the course of inaugural events. But these people are determined to put petty on a pedestal. When asked, why not say something like: Trumps supporters are hard-working Americans many of who could not make the trip, but were with him in spirit. It acknowledges the lower attendance, while offering a positive and potentially truthful explanation. 
 
Boom. Honesty and ownership. 
 
Think this is small stuff? The next time your kid lies about grades, where he or she has been or the time they will return home, just shrug it off as an alternative fact. Got less of a raise than your boss promised? Dont get mad, just accept your alternative fact. Spouse or significant other messing around? Embrace the alternative facts. Neighbor stole your lawn equipment and you have proof on video surveillance? Better look again, alternative facts. 
 
But they werent done. Spicer also said of Trump: He won overwhelmingly with 306 electoral votes, the most since any Republican since Reagan. 
 
The actual, not alternative facts, were gathered by the Associated Press. 
 
Not the most since Reagan, and not an overwhelming victory by historys standards. You only have to go back to George H.W. Bush to find a bigger Republican Electoral College winner. Bush captured 426 electoral votes in 1988, or 79 percent, well ahead of Trump with 306 electoral votes, or 57 percent, the AP reported Trump actually ended up with 304 electoral votes because of the defection of two electors in December, but he had won enough states to get to 306. 
 
The AP offered broader context: Trumps victory ranked 46th out of the 58 elections since the nations founding, far from the landslide that Trump himself has often claimed. Reagan achieved true blowouts, winning 489 electoral votes (91 percent) in 1980 and 525 (97.6 percent) in 1984. 
 
Ronald Reagans name should not roll off the lips of these people. There is no comparison. He was a true winner  a big one. He didnt build walls; he tore them down. He conducted himself as an honorable, decent man  worthy of our respect  landslide respect by todays low standards of acceptable conduct. And that is a FACT.
