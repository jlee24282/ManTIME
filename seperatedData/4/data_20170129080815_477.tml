<TITLE>UK trade negotiator will earn more than PM</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The government will pay its top post-Brexit international trade negotiator, tasked with sealing deals from North America to New Zealand, more than the prime minister, according to a job vacancy advertised on an internal civil service website. Soft Brexit campaigners say the 160,000 salary is a sign of the struggle the government is having in attracting the skilled staff it needs after decades of trade deals being handled from Brussels. In particular, there are fears the UKs much-vaunted move to the front of the queue for a deal with the Trump administration will see inexperienced officials overwhelmed by tougher US counterparts.Critics also think the salary is a waste of money for the first two years of the five-year contract because the UK will be unable to reach agreements until the terms of divorce from the EU are finalised in 2019.Headhunter Russell Reynolds Associates is leading the search for the Department for International Trades chief trade negotiation adviser. The company says that even more than 160,000 may be available for an exceptional candidate. Theresa May is paid just over 150,000 a year, while international trade secretary Liam Fox and other cabinet ministers are paid nearly 142,500. Angus MacNeil, who chairs the House of Commons international trade select committee, says a lack of domestic expertise means this and other senior negotiator roles will have to be filled by overseas candidates.He adds: It is indicative of the fact the UK is desperately thinking What now? What next? that it is paying top dollar. People complained about a Brussels bureaucracy, but this is probably going to end up being doubled in a Westminster and Whitehall bureaucracy just to replicate that work.Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron says: Appointing a trade envoy on 160,000, who will be paid more than the prime minister, who cannot actually do their job for two years, shows how frankly stupid this government is being over Brexit. James McGrory, co-executive director of Open Britain, says: The country desperately needs trade negotiators, but theyve got to do a lot more than sit around while Liam Fox twiddles his thumbs for two years unable to start negotiations.A Whitehall source insisted the salary reflected the extensive experience needed for the role. The job description asks for candidates who have a personal reputation of the highest order among global trade professionals and who can make sure the department will develop and negotiate free trade agreements and market access deals with non-EU countries.Final interviews for the job will take place in March, when the government will trigger the article 50 process that formalises Brexit negotiations. Fox hired Toby Orr, a senior partner at PR firm Portland, as his departments director of communications, a role that was advertised with a salary of 120,000.A spokeswoman for the Department for International Trade says: The new expert chief trade negotiation adviser will lead and support the establishment of a world-class trade negotiation function as the UK moves towards leaving the EU.This role is part of our ongoing recruitment, enabling us to build a team from the widest pool of talent in the civil service and externally, across a range of policy expertise and international experience.
