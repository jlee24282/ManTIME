<TITLE>19 Things That Happened at 1997 Oscars That Would Probably Never Happen Today</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The Academy Awards will go down at end of February, likely providing us with a gorgeous collection of red carpet gowns , plenty of PDA-friendly couples , and some truly spectacular moments . It will be the 89th iteration of the annual award show, and although they're sure to be great, we have a feeling it'll be hard to top what happened at the Oscars 20 years ago. That's right  the red carpet at the 1997 Oscars was, as the kids say, f*cking lit. The dress code included crop-tops, t-shirts, and velvet capes, and couples who seem bizarre to us now were getting cozy all over the place. 2017's show might have Ryan Gosling , but the one in 1997 had someone legitimately dressed as the Oscar statue. There's no coming back from that.
