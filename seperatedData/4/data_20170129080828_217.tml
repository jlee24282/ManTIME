<TITLE>Free Trade Leader: China Poised to 'Fill the Vacuum' After US Kills Off TPP</TITLE>
<TEXT>
On January 23, Donald Trump signed an executive order fulfilling his campaign promise tostop the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. 
 
Although it was uncertain whether the deal would have been ratified bythe US Congress, Trump's move has finally killed offthe controversial deal, which had 12 signatories and proposed tocreate the world's largest free trade area, accounting forroughly 40 percent ofglobal GDP. 
 
TTP was strongly supported byformer US President Barack Obama, who saw the free trade deal asa crucial part ofhis "pivot toAsia" foreign policy. 
 
However, the deal was the subject ofprotests inthe US and other countries such asNew Zealand, aspeople feared that reducing trade barriers would have a negative effect onjobs indeveloped countries, and that regulatory changes would leave public institutions vulnerable tolegal action frommultinational corporations and intensify the commercialization ofpublic services such ashealthcare. 
 
China was not involved inthe TPP negotiations, butother signatories have said they would liketo continue the project inanother form, withthe inclusion ofChina. 
 
On Tuesday, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he had held discussions withJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong aboutthe possibility ofcontinuing withoutthe US, butwith China. 
 
"There is also the opportunity forthe TPP toproceed withoutthe United States," Turnbull told reporters inCanberra. 
 
"Certainly there is the potential forChina tojoin the TPP," he added. 
 
Lourdes Casanova, Academic Director ofthe Emerging Markets Institute atCornell University, told Radio Sputnik that China is ready toassume a leadership role insupport ofglobal free trade, inthe absence ofthe US. 
 
"China is going totry tofill the vacuum that the US is leaving onthe one hand, and onthe second hand it will try toenlarge the APEC with21 members," Casanova said. 
In November, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum inLima, where he promoted the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), an alternative tothe TPP which is currently being negotiated by16 states inEast Asia and Australasia. 
"China will not shut its door tothe outsideworld butopen [them wider]," Xi told APEC delegates. 
 
President Xi also defended free trade ina speech tothe Davos World Economic Forum last week, and outlined plans toexpand the RCEP. 
 
"We will advance the building ofthe Free Trade Area ofthe Asia Pacific and negotiations ofthe Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership toform a global network offree trade arrangements. China stands forconcluding open, transparent and win-win regional free trade arrangements and opposes forming exclusive groups that are fragmented innature," the Chinese President said. 
 
Casanova said that Japan has been particularly hard hit bythe collapse ofthe TPP. 
 
"Japan has a historical rivalry withChina, so forJapan the TPP was very important and it feels it has been left alone. At the same time, let's not forget that China is already the most important trade partner forJapan, they already have a very close relationship interms oftrade, even if the rhetoric betweenthem is aggressive attimes." 
In the past, Mexico has seen China asan economic rival forthe US import market. However, Casanova said a closer relationship betweenMexico and China could be one consequence ofTrump's decision torenegotiate the NAFTA trade deal, because Mexico is entering the negotiations froma weaker position thanthe US or Canada. 
"Mexico ofcourse is the weakest link ofNAFTA, although forMexico the US was the most important trade partner; asmuch as80 percent ofMexican exports go tothe US, so Mexico is left ina bit ofa weak position." 
 
"What is Mexico going todo? One thing, ofcourse, is getting closer toChina. (Although) Mexico was one ofthe last countries toapprove the entry ofChina tothe WTO because they saw the threat toMexican exports ofChina's exports tothe US. So fromLatin America, Mexico was the country that probably had the most controversial stance againstChina. So, it would be a little bit odd if Mexico takes China's side." 
 
"But, already they have started saying that if Mexico doesn't trade withits neighbor (the US) afterthe renegotiation ofNAFTA, which would be the logical thing one way or the other, Mexico may turn toChina," Casanova said.
