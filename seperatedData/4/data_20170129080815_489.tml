<TITLE>Trump's order: Iran retaliates, bans US citizens</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Iran has announced that it will ban all United States citizens from entering the country. 
 
This was contained in an Iranian Foreign Ministry statement published on state media Saturday. 
 
The countrys decision is in response to President Donald Trumps executive order limiting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. 
 
The US decision to restrict travel for Muslims to the US, even if for a temporary period of three months, is an obvious insult to the Islamic world and in particular to the great nation of Iran, the statement said. 
 
Despite the claims of combating terrorism and keeping American people safe, it will be recorded in history as a big gift to extremists and their supporters, it said. 
 
Iran said the ban would remain in place until Trumps order was lifted. 
 
Iran is among seven countries whose nationals are barred from entering the United States for 90 days under Trumps order. 
 
The other six countries listed in the executive order are Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other nations may be added. 
 
The order, which exempts diplomats and members of international organizations, also stops the admission of all refugees to the United States for four months.
