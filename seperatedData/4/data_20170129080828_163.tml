<TITLE>Wilkinson: Are you problem-focused or solution-focused?</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Life is a spectrum. Introverts vs. Extroverts. Optimists vs. Pessimists. Jocks vs. Nerds. And all but a few of us fall somewhere between the two extremes. 
 
Another, though less often discussed spectrum, is related to problem solving. The two extremes here are whether you are problem-focused or solution-focused. 
 
Problem-focused individuals are really good at identifying what the problems are and where they are causing difficulties. They have the capacity to analyze a situation, and figure out where the breakdown is occurring. 
 
But what happens to individuals who are at the extreme end of the problem-focused spectrum? You probably know some of these individuals. They tend to see only the problems, and some see problems where there are none. 
 
Solution-focused individuals, on the other hand, are better at solving problems. They are really good at identifying interventions or strategies for resolving issues that are at the root of the problem. 
 
But too much of this can be a problem as well. When all you can see are solutions, you often fail to see the real problem. If the check engine light is on and it is annoying you, the easy solution is to remove the bulb. But, of course, this does not solve the real problem, it only solves your immediate discomfort. 
 
The differences between problem-focused and solution-focused individuals often arise in our relationships. If both partners are somewhere in the middle of the problem vs. solution spectrum, they are good at finding AND solving problems. But if one or both are at either end of the spectrum, difficulties can arise. 
 
Consider a couple where one of them only see only the problems. Every day, she talks about that days problems. Every day, she complains about the problems and ruminates over the distress caused by the problems. Yet, when her partner attempts to identify a solution, all she can see are the problems associated with that possible solution. It is a never-ending cycle filled with yeah, but and nope, that wont work. 
 
On the other hand, perhaps one of the partners is only solution-focused. In this case, he is always offering a solution. Although this may, at first, sound good, there are times when the other person just wants a chance to vent her frustrations or to share her feelings about something. But to the solution-focused person, every problem she brings up must have a solution. Instead of offering an understanding ear (and heart), he offers solutions. 
 
In either scenario, the relationship is strained and sometimes buckles under the weight of stress and discord. Neither partner is having his or her needs met and both are becoming increasingly frustrated. If you are in such a situation, talk with your partner. Share with him/her that there is a problem with how you  as a couple  manage problems. Talk openly about your differences. These differences are not easily recognized, because they are rooted in your life experiences. Quite often, they are also gender-based. Women are more apt to discuss the problem and how it makes them feel. Men dont care, they just want to solve the problem and move on. If she wants to explain how she feels, he becomes impatient. If he just wants to solve it, she becomes impatient. 
 
These differences are not easy to recognize or to change. So seek help from a professional if you cannot work it out together. There is a solution to this problem, but we must first identify the problem and accept that there is a solution. Both sides of this spectrum have to come together to resolve these issues.
