<TITLE>Patel ferocious in pursuit of 'Lion' role</TITLE>
<TEXT>
I read an article about it somewhere, Im not quite sure where, and I was completely mesmerized, said Patel, who is nominated for a Screen Actors Guild award tonight.

Its why the 26-year-old pursued the part so aggressively, showing up at screenwriter Luke Davies doorstep before the script was even finished, and, after winning the part, taking eight months to prepare. Not only did the rail-thin Patel bulk up to play the sporty Bierley, grow his hair out and learn a difficult Australian accent, but he also fully immersed himself into the emotional and spiritual reality of the man.

I traveled the trains in India. I wrote a diary. I went to orphanages. Id watched every piece of material about (Brierley) out there on Google and YouTube. When I met him I felt like, God Ive known you for eight, nine, months already, Patel said. Brierley and Patel had to go much deeper than that, though. This is not a simple boy goes home story. Brierleys traumatic separation from his home and his mother and struggle to survive on his own is contrasted by his then comfortable upbringing in Australia with supportive and loving adoptive parents. His past is something that he represses for years, until it becomes a ghost so undeniable that he must do everything he can to find his mother.

We sat down and spoke about this idea of guilt. He spoke about astral traveling with me. We got very meta in a way, Patel said. He could remember these things so vividly because every single night he would walk those streets home to his mother. Thats how he could remember it.

Its one of those stranger-than-fiction stories that begs for cinematic treatment.

I cant say that the majority or even half the movie is sensationalized. It really isnt. It actually happened in real life, Brierley said.

On set, director Garth Davis pushed Patel deeper into Brierleys pain. He had Patel watch the actor playing the 5-year-old Brierley (Sunny Pawar) so that there were specific memories to draw on. He threw him into big scenes right off the bat (they shot the very last scene first), and he made him do hippie mental exercises like staring into a mirror for a half hour before coming to set one day.

The first two minutes were excruciating, because when you do that, youre usually brushing your teeth or popping a pimple or something and then the next 20 minutes all of a sudden I got sucked into this sort of trance-like state and I couldnt recognize the person staring back at me, Patel said. I looked like my father, I looked like my mother. And I went to set visibly shaken. I was like Garth, I feel like a fool, like I dont know who I am. I think that the task went horribly wrong. He looked at me and said, thats exactly what you should feel. Your body is just a shell but your soul is ever-changing. I was like whoa. Patel is already fully on the awards trail for Lion. Hes done this before, but now has experience under his belt and is no longer that wide-eyed 18-year-old.

The first time around I was so beautifully naive about it. I look at Sunny and I can relate to it. He met Bill Clinton the other day and I dont quite think it dawned on him who the man was he was meeting, Patel said, laughing.
