Could there be yet another twist in the Chris Martin saga before the transfer window closes at 11pm on Tuesday? 
 
Derby County announced last night that the striker had signed a new three-and-a-half year contract despite being on a season-long loan at Championship rivals Fulham. 
 
The Rams want to terminate the loan early and Martin is keen to return, but Fulham are determined to keep hold of the Scottish international for the remainder of the campaign. 
 
Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic said last month: "I am not going to send him [Martin] back to Derby, he is going to stay with us, and he is going to respect the contract." 
 
There is no recall clause in the loan deal but the fact Martin has committed his long-term future to Derby looks to rule out a permanent move to Fulham in the summer. 
 
This might change Fulham's stance given that they are due to pay another significant chunk of the loan fee in the next few days, it is understood. 
 
How will the tug-of-war end? And could it end in the next few days? 
 
Fulham face Hull City today in an FA Cup fourth-round tie at Craven Cottage. 
 
Martin has scored nine goals in 20 games for the London club.
