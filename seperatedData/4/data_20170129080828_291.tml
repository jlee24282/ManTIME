An emotional Willie Revillame faced the public after he received heartwarming messages during his birthday celebration recently. 
 
In his show, Wowowin, Revillame expressed how grateful he is for getting love and affection from a lot of people, especially from his fans and the televiewers. 
 
Alam nyo, napakahirap ng buhay ko. Hindi nyo alam, lagi ko kayong iniisip, araw-araw, laging kayo, he said; trying to hold back his tears. 
 
[You know what, I have a very difficult life. You dont know it, but I always think of you, every day, its always you.] 
 
Kasi naman wala akong pamilyang tunay. Wala akong asawa, walang magulang, walang lahat, ako lang lagi umuuwi mag-isa. Pagkatapos ng taping, uwi. Gigising sa umaga, magkakape mag-isa, he further stated. 
 
[Because I have no real family. I have no wife, no parents, everything. I go home alone. After the taping, I go home. In the morning I wake up, drink coffee alone.]
