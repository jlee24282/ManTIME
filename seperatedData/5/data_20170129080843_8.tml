<TITLE>Reason for loss of US manufacturing jobs complicated</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The statistics are quite startling -- since 2000, the United States has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs. 
 
Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Wisconsin account for nearly a third of the manufacturing jobs lost, with wage levels in the manufacturing sector in these states either flat or sharply down. 
 
It should not come as a surprise to anyone that President Donald Trump, who promised to bring jobs back to America, carried all five of these states. 
 
So what accounts for this huge loss of jobs? Some of it was the result of U.S. companies shifting manufacturing operations to countries with lower wages. Maytag is an example of this. In 2004, Maytag shut down its refrigerator manufacturing plant down the road from us in Galesburg and shifted production to Reynosa, Mexico. 
 
That, however, is only part of the story. Much of the job loss is the result of increased use of robotics and automation. When I first visited the John Deere Harvester Works plant in East Moline in the mid-1970s, highly-skilled welders were hard at work welding together various components of the combines the plant was manufacturing. Workers in protective gear were spray-painting parts for the combines, either John Deere green or yellow depending on what the blueprints called for. Today, much of the welding is done by robots while an automated system dips the parts to be painted in vats of John Deere green or yellow. In short, many welders and painters have been displaced by automation. 
 
The broader picture tells much the same story. During the Obama years, U.S. manufacturing production increased by more than 20 percent. During the same period, however, manufacturing employment increased by only 5 percent, falling short of the number of manufacturing jobs lost during the 2008 recession. 
 
In an online article entitled Manufacturing Jobs Are Never Coming Back, Ben Casselman states, In recent years, factories have been coming back, but the jobs havent. Because of rising wages in China, the need for shorter supply chains and other factors, a small but growing group of companies are shifting production back to the U.S. But the factories they build here are heavily automated, employing a small fraction of the workers they would have a generation ago. 
 
President Trump has the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in the crosshairs, blaming this 20-year-old treaty for the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs. The extent to which this is the case is a matter of considerable debate. There is no question about a substantial number of U.S. manufacturing jobs being lost. But how much of this is the result of NAFTA and other trade agreements, compared to the impact of automation on employment levels? There is no consensus on this matter. 
 
A NAFTA provision states that a country can withdraw from the agreement six months after giving notice. If President Trump were to take unilateral action of that sort, the result would probably be quite chaotic. Most observers believe that he is not going to do that. Rather, his recent rhetoric suggests that his intent is to renegotiate the agreement with his counterparts in Mexico and Canada. 
 
That, however, is where matters start getting quite complicated. In his inaugural address, President Trump made very clear his commitment to an America first policy. Is there any reason to believe that his counterparts in Mexico and Canada would be willing to make concessions beneficial to the United States without getting something in return? And if not, what concessions would the United States need to make in a renegotiated trade agreement? Moreover, would the end result of a renegotiated agreement, when all is said and done, actually result in more manufacturing jobs in the United States, while diminishing the number of manufacturing jobs in Mexico? It is hard to imagine Mexicos president, Enrique Pena Nieto, agreeing to those types of concessions. 
 
The situation is complicated by the fact that Mexicans are enraged by President Trumps unilateral decision to construct a new wall between the two countries -- a wall he said during the campaign that Mexico would finance because he would tell them to do so. President Pena Nieto has emphatically stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall. 
 
There are a lot of balls up in the air. How this sorts out remains to be seen.
