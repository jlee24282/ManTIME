<TITLE>Ann Arbor Eddie, Ashleyluvssugar are big winners at Santa Anita</TITLE>
<TEXT>
ARCADIA >> The most lucrative races on Saturdays Sunshine Millions Cal Cup card turned out to be two of the most thrilling on a picturesque afternoon at Santa Anita. 
 
Ann Arbor Eddie rallied in deep stretch for a half-length victory over California Diamond in the $250,000 California Cup Derby for 3-year-olds, two races after Ashleyluvssugar beat What a View by a half-length in the $250,000 California Cup Turf Classic in front of an on-track crowd of 10,051. 
 
The two races were part of a 10-race program that included five stakes races restricted to horses bred or sired in California for a total of $1 million in purses. It was the fourth annual Sunshine Millions Cal Cup, and for the most part it was a chalky day. The first seven winners were post-time favorites. 
 
Ann Arbor Eddie, owned by two-time Derby winner J. Paul Reddam and trained by Doug ONeill, returned $7.20 as the 5-2 third choice, scoring his third victory in four starts under jockey Mario Gutierrez to improve his lifetime earnings to $238,700. He ran the 1 1/16 miles in 1:44.65. 
 
Ashleyluvssugar, trained by Peter Eurton and ridden by Flavien Prat, went postward as the even-money favorite on the strength of four Grade II victories on his resume. He won for the ninth time in 20 races, raising his bankroll to $1,145,004. 
 
For Ann Arbor Eddie, hes now won two of the races California Chrome won early in his career  the King Glorious Stakes and the Cal Cup Derby. Hes no Chrome, but that doesnt mean hes not eligible to go on and have a fine career. 
 
He hasnt done anything wrong, said ONeills assistant, Leandro Mora. ONeill was in Florida to saddle Semper Fortis in the Pegasus World Cup. 
 
Hes given us three wins and a third, so were very, very pleased. 
 
Gutierrez said he was concerned at the three-eighths pole when Ann Arbor Eddie, a Square Eddie gelding, didnt seem interested in finishing. 
 
I started asking him a little bit. He didnt want to pick up the bit, he said. I was worried a little bit turning for home because I really had to ask him. He has so much more ability than that. Hes still a little green. 
 
Mora said he wouldnt be surprised if Reddam shoots for bigger things next time. 
 
Dont be surprised if we go against the big guys, he said. Weve done well so far, so why not keep following that philosophy? 
 
Ashleyluvssugar, who received a rail-skimming ride until the stretch, when Prat swung the 6-year-old gelded son of Game Plan to the outside of pacesetting What a View, came in off a fifth-place finish in the Grade I Breeders Cup Turf at Santa Anita and a second-place showing in the Grade II Hollywood Turf Cup at Del Mar. 
 
 
Prat said he encountered no problems during his 1 1/8-mile journey on the grass that resulted in a final clocking of 1:46.43. 
 
I had a good trip, he said. It came really easy. Once he gets the lead, he doesnt want to open up, but he knows he has to keep at least a head in front. 
 
Said Eurton: That was a nice, easy lead that What a View got. I didnt think wed get by him for a minute there, but Ashleys got a lot of class. 
 
Eurton said the $200,000 Grade II San Luis Rey Stakes at Santa Anita on March 25 might be the next stop for Ashleyluvssugar. 
 
In the three other Sunshine Millions Cal Cup races: 
 
 Sircat Sally transferred her terrific dirt form to the grass in the $200,000 California Cup Oaks for 3-year-old fillies, following a 12-length victory in the Soviet Problem Stakes at Los Alamitos on Dec. 17 with a 2 1/4-length win as the 4-5 favorite with Tyler Baze aboard. Winning time was 1:35.08 for the one mile on turf. 
 
 Richards Boy, the 2-1 favorite, took the lead at the top of the stretch and then held on to beat Well Measured by a nose under Prat in the $150,000 California Cup Sprint. The 5-year-old gelded son of Idiot Proof ran the six furlongs in 1:08.71. 
 
 Enola Gray won for the fifth time in eight starts, running away to win the $150,000 Sunshine Millions Filly and Mare Turf Sprint by 3 1/4 lengths as the 3-5 choice with Baze aboard. The 4-year-old daughter of Grazens winning time for the 6 1/2 furlongs down the hillside turf course was 1:12.1
