<TITLE>Trump's Executive Orders Are No 'Alternative Fire'</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Updated 2 hours ago 
LaAntorcha de la Amistad , or the Torch of Friendship, is one of the most recognizable landmarksin downtown San Antonio. Commissioned by the Asociacin de Empresarios Mexicanos (AEM) and created by Mexican sculptor Sebastin, this gift from the Mexican government representsthe shared culture and cooperation betweenthe cityand Mexico. 
 
The new presidents executive orders to build a multi-billion dollar border wall, amp up Border Patrol forces, crack down on illegal immigration, and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have jeopardized the relationship between the U.S.and its southern neighbor and yieldedboth concern and silence amonglocal officials. 
 
While Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway coined the term  alternative facts  in regards to false statements made by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, the impending crisis between the U.S. and Mexico is no alternative fire, but it is one local leaders hope can be put out. 
 
Its a crisis driven by rhetoric rather than facts, Consul General in San Antonio Hctor Velasco Monroy told the Rivard Report on Friday. Both countries benefit enormously from the relationship, yet the words coming out of Washington misinform people and make them believe otherwise. 
 
The historical context of San Antonio and Texas in relation to Mexico is very different compared to other areas in the U.S., Velasco said, so he is counting on San Antonians to now stand up for preserving those ties.
