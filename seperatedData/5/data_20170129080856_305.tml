GENEVA  Syrias government and opposition will meet for the first time in an attempt to halt the nearly three-year-old civil war that has killed more than 100,000 people, the United Nations said Monday. Previous attempts to bring the two sides together have failed, mainly because of disputes over who should represent the opposition and the government, Syrian President Bashar Al-Assads future role in the country, and whether Iran, Saudi Arabia and other regional powers should be at the table.
