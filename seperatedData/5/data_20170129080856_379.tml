<TITLE>"It's the future": Restaurants and cafs are cracking down on smoking outside</TITLE>
<TEXT>
A NUMBER OF cafs and restaurants in the capital are cracking down on smoking outside their premises, by designating no-smoking areas on their terraces.

JoBurger and the Metro Caf are two of the Dublin locations which have installed no smoking zones outside, where customers sit and eat. They told us that they havent had major complaints from customers over the move.

In 2004, Ireland became the first country in the world to ban smoking in the workplace, and the price of tobacco has risen in subsequent budgets.

Just under a quarter of adults in Ireland are smokers. The latest Healthy Ireland survey found that 23% of adults in Ireland smoke  the same proportion as in the 2015 survey. But it also found that 48% of all smokers want to quit.

Almost 13 years on from the smoking ban, playgrounds are next on the list for being designated as non-smoking areas.

Where is smoking banned?

Under the law, smoking is banned in a place of work, including a licensed premises once it is a place of work.

The Citizens Information Board explains:

It also notes that employers have the discretion to provide an outdoor smoking area, subject to the requirements of the law  this means a place or premises, or part of a place or premises, that is not covered by a roof  or one that is covered by a roof, as long as not more than 50% of the perimeter is covered by a wall, windows, gate, or similar.

Joe Macken of JoBurger and Niall Kavanagh (co-owner with Eileen Kavanagh) of Metro Caf told us why they have taken steps to limit where their customers can smoke.

We are getting a really good response

At JoBurger, a Dublin gourmet burger chain, they have had smoking on their outside terrace banned for almost a year, while another business Metro Caf recently designated part of its outside terrace for no-smoking. In both cases, food is served on the terraces.

Macken, of JoBurger, told TheJournal.ie that despite the fact he and most of his managers are smokers, they decided to introduce the measure at their two restaurants on Castle Market and at Smithfield because of their general disgust for smoking when youre eating  its just horrible.

For Macken, the decision has a lot to do with the needs and health of his staff, as well as customers. [With] no smoking laws youre not allowed to smoke in a workplace, and a terrace is a workplace, he pointed out.

We found we are getting a really, really good response to it, said Macken. Our customers are really responding to it.

The terraced area outside JoBurger is marked off with wind-breakers. Macken said that they havent gotten many complaints about the move, saying that smokers have adapted.

We get some people that just stand outside the door [to smoke], he said. Most people get the whole buzz about it.

Health concerns

Macken is such a proponent of the idea that he has even asked people from neighbouring restaurants and cafs if they plan on bringing in the change.

Its invasive, said Macken of smoking in public areas. I am real fussy, I cant hide it and I cant deal with the smell.

Its a choice its more about respect  its only when youre eating, he added.

People used to laugh at me sitting outside

Over at Metro Caf, the introduction of a no-smoking area outside the caf at 43 South William Street came after some planning. We had planned on introducing it last year and we just never got around to it, so it was always on my mind, said co-owner Niall Kavanagh.

The site also doesnt have wifi, because the owners wanted to have people chatting and talking away and I didnt think the cafe was the right place to be staring at a computer as a mini office explained Kavanagh.

While currently around 30% of Metros outside space is designated non-smoking, Kavanagh wants to more than double this. So far we have designated a small area, but were waiting on the heaters to come so we can expand that. [We want] 80% of it non-smoking. I think 20% of it would be sitting outside that you can smoke.

He and his partner were inspired by New Yorks caf culture when it came to opening their own premises, with the aim of having a warm space outside where people can watch the world go by. And now, this means most of the clientele wont be able to have a smoke while doing so.

But Kavanagh has always been ahead of the trend when it comes to making big changes.

Kavanagh, who is a non-smoker, said that he loves to sit outside his caf and wants his customers to feel the same.

He wants his customers to enjoy the free theatre of sitting outside on South William Street, and not to have to endure someones elses smoke.

On a walk down South William St, TheJournal.ie noticed that most cafs have ashtrays on their outside terraces.

Like Macken, Kavanagh also cited concerns about his staff members health. He is also a major proponent of small, locally-owned cafs.

People are browned off with chains  they want the experience, he said.

Its the future, he said of smoke-free caf experiences. Like caf culture was the future years ago.

They are within their rights

Adrian Cummins of the Restaurant Association of Ireland said he hadnt heard from members about a major move to bring in more non-smoking areas, but if food is served obviously they are within their rights to do so.

I havent heard of any member talking about it  by and large it doesnt seem to be an issue and I havent heard any consumers giving out, he said. Within my knowledge they are within their rights to do it.

Its up to the restaurant owners to do what they want to do and we would support them, said Cummins.

If its a public area outside thats defined as a pub and not private property that brings in a totally other legal concept, said Cummins.

Whereas if you have a windbreaker and youre defining your property from within that thats within your property.

We abide by the law and we support it.

The smokers point of view

The spokesperson for smokers group Forest Ireland told TheJournal.ie that the group believes the public should be allowed to make up their own mind about smoking areas, and this extends to pub and restaurant owners.

In Holland you can decide; you can designate your pub as a smoking pub, he said. Thats the way we thought it should have been done here.

The spokesperson said he doubted that there would be consistent interest in outdoor non-smoking areas from non-smokers. Smokers will go out in the cold and rain, he said. It will all look lovely in the summertime [but not in winter].

They have no other choice so they will go out, he said of smokers enthusiasm for outdoor areas.

Forest Irelands preference is for indoor smoking areas away from the main non-smoking areas. And what do the smokers want anyway  it would be lovely if they had a smoking room away from the main bar with a roof on it and tables and chairs and so on, that they could just go out to, said the spokesperson of pubs.

But he also said that out of courtesy you wouldnt have people smoking in front of people eating. If people have food outside it wouldnt make sense if people are eating.

He said that smokers are outside because they are forced out there.

They just decided to force them out to shame them out onto the street. Now they make it difficult for them by not providing any facilities outside.

The spokesperson said that Forest Ireland is not in favour of people smoking and doesnt promote smoking.

He added that a recent study by Forest in the UK which looked into why people smoke found that the vast majority said they smoke because they enjoy it.
