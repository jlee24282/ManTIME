<TITLE>Game On: Why we cant wait for Project Scorpio</TITLE>
<TEXT>
The most powerful game console to be released. 
 
Only a few details are available for Microsofts upcoming Project Scorpio: which was dubbed as the most powerful console to be released. We can save the PC vs console arguments on another article, since the new generation of game consoles released in the past year at now (almost) at par with high-end gaming PCs. 
 
First off, the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 being to the current crop of eighth-generation consoles, but years after they were released we were treated to new upgrades in the likes of the PS4 Pro and the upcoming Project Scorpio. These consoles were not made to be replacements to the current generation, but cited as alternative options for gamers who want more powerful hardware. 
 
Lets talk numbers. The recently released PS4 Pro achieves 4.2 teraflops, enough for some games to be rendered in 4K or depending on how developers make it, improve graphic fidelity and visuals. 
 
Project Scorpio was announced to support up to 6 teraflops  meaning that it will top out all other consoles once it is released. To compared, Nvidias latest GTX 1080 graphics card supports 10-11 teraflops. 
 
That would mean games will look better than ever. And with the recent push for 4K support on games, you can now enjoy games on a much higher resolution. But just like the PS4 Pro, you would need a compatible display to be able to appreciate the performance upgrade. 
 
Project Scorpios specifications (8-core AMD processor, 320 GB of memory bandwidth, and 6 teraflop GPU) are truly impressive, though wed only appreciate it more once we see gameplay sampled from the console. 
 
Microsoft only mentioned Project Scorpios release date to be this holiday season, and there is a good chance that this high-end gaming console wont be cheap. The company did say that the console is for gamer who wont have a high-end Windows 10 PC. 
 
When you look at it, spending money on Project Scorpio would technically be cheaper than upgrading or buying a new gaming PC.
