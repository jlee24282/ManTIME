During the Michigan DNRs free fishing weekend, fishing license fees will be waived for two days. Residents and out-of-state visitors may enjoy fishing on all waters for all species of fish, the DNR website states. All other fishing regulations still apply. No DNR recreation passport will be required.

Free fishing weekends occur twice a year, once in the winter and once in the summer. The website states that Michigan offers some of the best freshwater fishing, with more than 3,000 miles of Great Lakes shoreline, more than 11,000 inland lakes and tens of thousands of miles of rivers and streams.

For many, the annual Free Fishing Weekend has become a tradition  a time to get together and have some fishing fun, the website states. While some may find time to reflect while fishing, there are no limits to variations on a great theme! Experienced anglers who offer a child or young adult the chance to take their first fishing trip can provide a rewarding experience for all.

Many counties take advantage of this weekend, including Macomb County. On Feb. 18, the Macomb Sportsmen Society will host its fourth annual Youth Ice Fishing Derby at Lake St. Clair Metro Park, located at 31300 Metropolitan Parkway in Harrison Township. The event will take place from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m.

Youth of all ages and experience are invited. MSS will teach those interested how to ice fish, if needed. All bait and gear will be provided, or participants may bring their own. The cost is $5 per participant and includes lunch and hot chocolate. First through third place finishers will receive prizes in the two age divisions, which are 9 and under and 10 to 16. The derby is an outdoor event, so those attending should plan to dress accordingly.

For more information about this event, or to register, call 248-342-7778 or email George at georgepretty@yahoo.com. For more information about the Michigan DNRs free fishing weekend, visit michigan.gov/dnr.
