<TITLE>Beauty queens run in the genes</TITLE>
<TEXT>
SIERRA VISTA - Being a beauty queen is a family trait for Mariah and Charity May, longtime Sierra Vista residents. 
   
Mariah, 22, added another pageant title to her resume on Jan. 14 when she was crowned Miss Windy City at the 2017 scholarship competition held at the Victory Gardens Biograph Theater in Chicago. 
   
Mariahs sister, Charity, is the 2016 Miss Sierra Vista. 
   
Both women are enrolled at Wheaton College in the Chicago area, with Mariah now in her senior year finishing studies in Psychology and Urban Studies. Charity is a freshman at the college. 
   
Family and friends were in attendance on Jan. 14, watching Mariah capture the title as Miss Windy City at the pageant. Along with her sister Charity, mom Carla Reaves and best friend, Helena Hunt were in the audience. Cydney Reaves, Mariahs little sister, competed in the Miss Chicago Pageant Princess event. Hunt, who grew up in Sonoita, now works and lives in the Chicago area. 
   
Mariahs efforts to raise awareness about youth trauma on Chicagos South Side was a central message in her efforts to secure the Miss Windy City pageant title. 
   
I have a strong sense of dedication to Chicago's youth, and want to ultimately, impact the nation- educating others about the issues of trauma in youth and inspire other adults to invest in the lives of children in their own communities, combatting this issue and giving all children the opportunities they deserve: to be happy and live well, Mariah said in her contest essay. 
   
Over the past four years, Mariah has been directly involved with youth mentorship and witnessed the positive impact it has on the lives of young people. She is a volunteer with the Chicago-based youth mentorship, "By The Hand" Club for Kids and Group Outreach for Youth. Her experience includes working with more than 100 youth throughout the Chicago area. 
   
Charity was the 49th winner of the Sierra Vista pageant in July, 2015. During her year as Miss Sierra Vista, she focused on providing support to at-risk youth and making a difference in the lives of young people. It is important, Charity said, that people get involved and address those needs. 
   
Like her sister, Mariah May has an impressive history of pageant success. She grew up in Sierra Vista, with mother, Carla Reaves, and step-father, Everette Reaves and graduated from Veritas Christian Community School in Sierra Vista. She was active in the local Cinderella Scholarship Pageant Program, winning the local Cochise County, Arizona State and the International Cinderella Pageants in 2
