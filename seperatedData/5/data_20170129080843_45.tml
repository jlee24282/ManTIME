<TITLE>Eroding the English language</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Where have you gone, gone? 
 
I have not seen, I saw. 
 
Where is there are? 
 
Between you and  who? 
 
How do I feel about poverty: bad or badly? 
 
Has one come or came? Depends on what you have! 
 
Whats happened to fundamental American English? What virus has it contracted causing even an allegedly educated newsperson to utter on TV: I had went to the White House? 
 
As a former English teacher with 38 years chalked up, I took a somewhat sophisticated grammar quiz awhile back on Facebook geared at the fifth-grade level to see if I still had it. I scored 98 percent by carelessly (not ignorantly) misidentifying an indirect object. Ironically, the quiz erroneously used alright in its instructions. 
 
Wasnt it Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady the musical adaptation of Shaws Pygmalion  who asked: Why cant the English learn to speak? Apparently Americans have joined the jargon of the unique English of the British cockney. 
 
I am flabbergasted at the insidious corruption of spoken American English. I have not ferreted out why Americans no longer speak precisely. Perhaps teaching English stopped in grade five. So, are we slovenly or fundamentally ignorant orperhaps both? 
 
All right , between you and me (not I), I saw (not seen) evidence of stark poverty in Washington, D.C., when I had gone (not went) there 10 years ago. There are (not there is) many homeless folks for whom I feel bad (not badly) surviving, barely living, around our nations Capitol. 
 
It has come (not came) down to who will rescue them. 
 
There are tremendously more important problems to repair than speaking correctly. Still, if were to become a great nation again, shouldnt we be proud to speak English correctly for starters?
