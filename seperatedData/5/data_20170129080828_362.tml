<TITLE>Tigers attack, pull away from Salem at Scoreboard Guy Shootout</TITLE>
<TEXT>
There was a little bit of confusion about the score midway through the third quarter Jan. 28 and, after some discussion between coaches and officials, it was decided that Salem was leading Ozark 34-31. Bre Johnson and Mikayla Putt made sure it didnt stay that way for very long.
