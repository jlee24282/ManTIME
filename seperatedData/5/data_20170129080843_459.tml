<TITLE>City of Greeley launches water budget program, setting personalized budgets for every Greeley household</TITLE>
<TEXT>
For the first time in 100 years, Greeley residents may have the freedom this year to water their lawns whenever they want. 
 
Since 1907, residents have faced limits on watering days  usually every other day  during warmer months. Thanks to an overhauled water budget system , residents may soon have the power to pick their days  any days; all days  so long as they stay within their budget. 
 
The Greeley water and sewer board approved lifting the restrictions, but the city council will have to give final approval  likely next month. 
 
Its pretty simple, said Harold Evans, chairman of the citys water and sewer board. If Im going to say you have a budget, we shouldnt tell you what days you should water. 
 
Watering freedom would run from April 1 through Oct. 31, and city officials would take a look at the results before deciding whether to keep it going in 2018. The water budget, however, is here to say. 
 
The water budget and watering day freedom  would apply only to residential, single-family homes. Even then, the city will restrict watering between noon-5 p.m. Businesses and other commercial property will maintain the same water rate structure as theyve had in the past. 
 
Single-family homes account for nearly half of the citys overall water usage, making that category ripe for change. 
 
Evans said the budget, which will take effect Wednesday, is more than a decade in the making, as city officials sought to stave off the effects of a drought like the one the state saw in early 2000s . 
 
Coming to consensus took a lot of work, as did developing the budget for every household. 
 
Greeley staffers mapped every plot of land in Greeley to calculate the amount of irrigable area  basically any property you have outside of your roof, sidewalk and driveway. They used that area, combined it with an assumption that every inch of that area is planted with bluegrass, and came up with a formula that spits out enough water to take care of all of that. 
 
I think its the core of what the water budget is all about, City Manager Roy Otto said, referencing the personalized water budget. 
 
Inside, the city will budget 55 gallons per person per day, with the assumption that there are three people in every household. (Call the city if you have a larger family). 
 
City officials say the budget should provide more than enough water for most residents. In testing the program with 16,700 households, the city found 83 percent of folks stayed within budget. 
 
If you dont, well, youll get charged more. This years base rate is $3.97 per 1,000 gallons, which is actually cheaper than what folks paid last year. 
 
If you use up to 130 percent more than your budget, youll pay $4.85 per gallon for anything over your budget. The rates go up to $6.62 and then $8.82 per 1,000 gallons from there. Just 4 percent of the pilot group of 16,700 households went that far over their budget. 
 
We think weve developed a program that will reward efficiency, and yet it will also provide an incentive for people who are over-watering to cut back, Evans said. 
 
For now, the changes wont apply to businesses or other commercial property. Thats a little more tricky. 
 
A typical, tiered-rate structure would have been easier. That would involve one rate for a certain amount of water, and higher rates for anything above that. 
 
Fort Collins has one, and such a structure can punish homeowners with a larger lot even if those homeowners practice water conservation. 
 
Without that work done by the staff, we would have arbitrarily penalized people for being efficient with their water just for having a larger lot, Otto said. 
 
City officials spent so much time studying the outdoor water use because they say its the area with the most potential for savings. In some months  particularly April and October, when people run their sprinklers more than necessary  the city as a whole could cut water usage by half or more, according to city data. 
 
As Greeley grows toward 250,000 people by 2060, getting folks in the habit of thinking about water conservation will be key, Evans said. 
 
Theres a finite supply of water in Colorado, Evans said. Weve got to be more efficient.
