<TITLE>US economy grew by 1.6 per cent in 2016</TITLE>
<TEXT>
New figures this weekend show the US economy grew at a slower than expected pace last quarter. 
Quarter four GDP came in at 1.9 per cent. Thats a drop from 3-and-a-half per cent the quarter before. GDP for the year is estimated at 1.6 per cent, the slowest growth in five years. However, economists are expecting stronger growth in 2017. President Donald Trump promised to lift growth to 4 per cent through tax cuts and infrastructure spending.
