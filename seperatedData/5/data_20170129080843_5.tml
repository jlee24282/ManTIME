<TITLE>Sania settles for mixed doubles runners-up trophy</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Abigail Spears and Juan Sebastian Cabal have combined to beat second-seeded Sania Mirza and Ivan Dodig 6-2, 6-4 to win the Australian Open mixed doubles title. 
The defeat denied the Indian tennis ace her seventh major title. 
 
The 35-year-old Spears played her part at the Australian Open golden oldies party with her win. 
 
Spears was striving to win her first Grand Slam title in her farewell year. She plans to retire at the end of this season after a career in which she was twice runner-up in mixed doubles finals with Mexican Santiago Gonzalez at the US Open in 2013 and 2014. 
 
The triumph by Spears and 30-year-old Cabal continued the veteran's theme of the championships with 30-plus players in the men's and women's singles finals, too. 
 
Meanwhile, Mirza and Dodig pairing failed to lift the trophy in their second Grand Slam final together. 
 
The duo lost the French Open title clash to Leander Paes and Martina Hingis last season.
