<TEXT>
WHEELING  A pair of Ohio Valley diamond gems are on deck to receive the ultimate honor. 
 
Bellaires Scot Maffe and John Marshalls Chris Jones are both ticketed for the Ohio Valley Athletic Conference Hall of Fame, representing the decade of the 1980s, this summer. 
 
Maffe and Jones will be formally inducted into the OVAC Hall, which is sponsored by Robinson Automotive Group, on Saturday, Aug. 19. 
 
The annual induction ceremony will again be held at WesBanco Arena. 
 
This is the third successive year that the Hall of Fame committee is releasing the honorees every two weeks until April rather than waiting until later in the spring to announce the honorees. The class representing the decade of the 1970s will be published on Feb. 12. 
 
Heres a capsule look at the honorees: 
 
SCOT MAFFE, Bellaire (Class of 1985)  Be it football, basketball or baseball, Maffe delivered in quality fashion for the Big Reds. 
 
Although equally productive in all three sports, baseball was his linchpin. After his stellar Big Reds diamond career, he matriculated to Ohio University. He played baseball three years for the Athens-based Bobcats, lettering two of those seasons. 
 
Maffe was a four-year letterwinner in baseball at Bellaire, earning a myriad of honors after establishing a host of school records. When he completed his Big Reds career he owned the following baseball records: season at-bats (105), career singles (85), doubles in a game (3), triples in a game (2), RBI in a game (6), career runs (95), stolen bases in a game (4), season (33) and career (55); innings pitched season (76), career (202) and pitching wins season (12), career (26).

Maffe was a two-year starter at quarterback for John Magistro in football. Magistro had high praise for his former signal-caller. 
 
Scot was one of the finest all-around athletes to play at Bellaire. I had the privilege to coach him in both football and baseball, and the first thing that comes to mind in describing him,  a clutch performer.  If you wanted someone to have the ball in their hands when it was crunch time Scot was your guy. You name the sport and Scot excelled in it, Magistro said. 
 
He was special mention all-Ohio as a senior. He was also the Big Reds grid captain that season. 
 
Maffe was a slick and savvy point guard for Coach Gene Ammirante on the hardwood. 
 
The three-year hoop letterwinner was a second-team all-Valley honoree as a junior. He enjoyed a banner senior campaign for Coach A, earning first-team all-OVAC, all-District and all-Valley honors while also being a special mention all-Ohio honoree. 
 
Scots wife  Kim  died in 2009 after a courageous battle with leukemia. Scot has three children  Chase, Michelle and Chance. 
 
Maffe teaches at Beallsville. 
 
CHRIS JONES, John Marshall (Class of 1982)  Bob Montgomery has authored a legendary career as the longtime head baseball coach at John Marshall. In his four-plus decades at the Monarch helm, he has garnered nearly 900 wins. 
 
So when he says Chris Jones is the best high school player Ive coached, it has impact. The talented righthander, who also yielded a potent bat, has the stats to back up that statement. 
 
In his three years on the Monarch mound, Jones recorded an amazing 30-3 pitching mark. Two of his setbacks were shutout defeats. He helped JM capture three successive OVAC 4A titles (1980-82) while compiling a brilliant 84-15-1 record. 
 
Jones started his JM career on a high note, compiling a 9-0 pitching mark as a sophomore as Montgomerys charges won an amazing 31 of 33 starts. Jones was accorded second-team all-Valleys honors that spring. 
 
He raised his level of play even more as a junior, dazzling both as a hurler and a hitter as JM compiled a stellar 25-4 mark. 
 
At the plate, Jones led the valley with a smoking .500 batting average, going 46-of-92 with eight doubles, six triples, three homers, 31 RBI while scoring 26 runs. As a pitcher, he won 10 of 11 decisions, striking out 122 in 78 innings of work. He had a miniscule 1.62 ERA while walking just 31 batters. He earned first-team, all-state, all-Valley and all-OVAC plaudits that spring. 
 
Jones was just as dominating as a senior, helping JM garner a 28-9-1 record. He struck out 171 batters in 97 innings of work. He was 11-2 on the mound with a 1.61 ERA. 
 
He batted .393 with 44 hits and an Ohio Valley-leading eight home runs. He knocked in 37 runs and scored 32 more. He blasted six triples and two doubles. 
 
He was named co-captain of the all-Valley team while also being named first-team all-state, all-OVAC and all-Mountaineer League. 
 
Jones also sparkled on the gridiron as a senior, earning honorable mention all-OVAC honors as a defensive back. 
 
The Ohio State University won the recruiting battle for the talented Monarch. Jones was in the Buckeyes starting rotation as a sophomore and junior, going 8-8 with 134 strikeouts.
