<TITLE>Tribune Opinion: Salida del Sol Academy put our children in danger by investigating sex-related compliant without calling police</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Greeleys police department is investigating whether officials at Salida del Sol Academy broke the law by failing to report a sex-related complaint involving an eighth-grade girl and a male teacher. 
 
We dont need to wait for the investigation to wonder what the heck Executive Director Joe Melendez and school security guard Anthony Antuna were thinking. 
 
Melendez and Antuna and apparently members of the school board did one of the worst things school leaders can do by doing their own investigation instead of reporting it to the police: They put their schools interests before the safety of our children. 
 
You probably saw the movie Spotlight, right? It won an Oscar for Best Picture. Anyway, the movie was about the brilliant work the Boston Globe did to uncover the damage wrought by Catholic Church leaders who covered up sexual abuse among the priesthood. As a result, many more kids were abused. 
 
Mandatory reporting laws exist precisely so something like that doesnt happen again. Thats why it doesnt matter that Melendez and Antuna are former police officers. When they chose to investigate the complaint themselves, they showed they learned nothing from Spotlight or any other incident like it. We dont know what happened between the teacher and the girl. But we arent soothed by the fact that Melendez and Antuna fired the teacher. In our mind, this makes the oversight worse. This means they released a man they deemed unfit to work at their school out into the world to save the school some perceived embarrassment. 
 
In fact, some evidence shows the teacher displaying a disturbing pattern of inappropriate behavior and possibly abuse. He was apparently coached on how to conduct himself appropriately and professionally in order to make sure there werent any allegations, a board member, Virginia Rosales, said an in email. 
 
We certainly would have reported it if there was something sufficient enough to do that, Rosales said in the email. 
 
The thing is, thats not Salidas decision to make, and thats not the decision of Melendez and Antuna. Thats for law enforcement to decide. That is, in fact, what law enforcement will decide now. Only now, in our mind, its mostly too late. A man who potentially did something inappropriate to an eighth-grader, and who may have shown a pattern of abuse to children, is out there now, and its entirely possible he could be teaching again, or working with children in some way. Our children are now not as safe as they could be as a result. 
 
We say its mostly too late. Theres still one outcome we hope happens soon. It would be inappropriate for us to root for criminal charges, but we at least look forward to the police department completing a fair, accurate and scouring investigation of the school board, Melendez and Antuna. Most of all, we want it to be as public as possible. Thats exactly the kind of embarrassment they wanted the school to avoid. The only difference now is that theyre the ones who caused it.
