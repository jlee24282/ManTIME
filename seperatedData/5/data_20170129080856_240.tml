<TITLE>Phillips: What they don't know about us</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Ive become protective of you. My hackles went up more than once the past couple ofweeks as I traveled and listened to people on the East Coast tell me about where I live. In case you didnt know, the middle part of America  thats us - has been placed on the therapist couch. We are pinned to a tar tray, under bright lights, so the rest of the country can dissect and examine our organs and muscles, and wonder aloud to each other about how we are built. 
   
As I traveled, I listened as people told me how you felt and what you thought. They knew all about it because they read it somewhere, written by someone who flew out and sat for a time with the men at a small town diners Stammtisch table and reported back what they heard. 
   
Youre an idiot. Thats the thing I meant to say in my head, but that I said out loud in response to a woman across the table from me. Part of my trip was to finish grad school in Vermont, and a big part of grad school is to share writing and research and have your peers tear it apart and hand you back the remnants in a dustpan. I offered up an essay I wrote about Grant Wood, about how the interpretation of his work shifts as people change the way they see the Midwest. The woman said, I dont know why you had to make it political. Rural America is not political. People dont think. They just accept the R label and thats it. 
   
Youre an idiot. Maybe thats what the two-party system has done to us. Maybe our perception of each other has become binary and boring. Maybe it has turned that woman into an idiot who cant see that everyone has a complex belief system, developed over years of good and bad experiences, shaped by landscape and friendships and family. 
   
Weve all been given gifts specific to our lifes path and the gift Ive been given is the chance to live in all parts of the country  Arizona, Colorado, Alaska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Maine, Southern Illinois, Idaho, Wyoming and now in Iowa. Its a beautiful thing to have explored all the corners of this country, to have been a witness to many ways of living and to have listened to so many life stories born of different geographies. Its made me a more compassionate person. Its made me more aware of complexities. Its also made me impatient with broad brush strokes and flattened explanations of the behavior of strangers. 
   
That womans comment rang in my head. My hackles didnt go down. I know theres a lot more words to be written and spoken about us, about this place. 2017 is the mea culpa tour as journalists and authors and pollsters strain to hear what they couldnt hear before the election. And theres something to admire in that, in self-examination. But my defenses are up and if those words are going to go out, I want to contribute.

For a while, I want to use this my editors column differently, and I need your help. I want to write about what people believe and how they got there and how it continues to evolve. Im looking for people willing to let me in to their lives and their thoughts, so we can explore ideas together  in the moment and in this column. Im not quite sure what shape or direction this will take, but Id like to try it, with your input and, most likely, a little patience. 
   
If you want to be part of a column, or if you have a suggestion of someone who might be willing, send me an email or give me a call. I look forward to hearing from you.
