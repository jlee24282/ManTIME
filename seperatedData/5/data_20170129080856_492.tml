<TITLE>New bill may allow some direct beer sales from breweries</TITLE>

Two years after the Georgia Beer Jobs Bill gave craft breweries in the state the opportunity to kind of, sort of, in a roundabout way, sell some beer to customers, a new bill introduced in the Georgia General Assembly may allow breweries to actually sell moderate amounts of beer directly to customers. 

 
Senate Bill 85, introduced Friday, is billed as a compromise between the states brewers and wholesalers. Georgia has a strict three-tier system that separates producers, wholesalers and retailers. 
 
Under the bill, Georgias small breweries could offer direct sales by the glass on premises, and even sell up to a case  or case equivalent  worth of beer to go to individuals. Breweries would be limited to direct-selling 3,000 barrels of beer per year. 
 
Breweries in the state, including Newnans Abide Brewing, are hoping that the bill will pass. 
 
Right now, Abide doesnt bottle its beer, but the brewery is in the midst of a major expansion. If the bill goes through, we will be pushing pretty hard to get into a package form, said Evan Scanlan, one of the brewerys three owners. 
 
Under the current scenario, breweries can sell tours  and give away servings of beer. With a standard tour, visitors get a souvenir glass and 36 ounces of beer, divided into six, six-ounce pours. State law allows tour packages to also include some to-go beer, in a sealed growler bottle, but Abide doesnt offer that. 
 
According to co-owner Philip Leonard, the biggest advantage of the bill passing would be a greater potential for sales. It would allow Abide Brewery to sell directly to consumers, and would lift the mandate for all events to follow the pattern of the standard tour. 
 
Right now, we sell something, then the distributor sells it, then the retailer, Leonard explained. The passing of the law may allow us to recapture some of the profit. This would, in turn, allow Abide to expand the business. 
 
Leonard added that the owners may even be able to host events at the brewery in which they could sell directly to the customers. Birthday parties, corporate retreats or meetings could be hosted at the brewery without the current restrictions. 
 
The brewery has 13 beers on tap, Scanlan said. There are five beers currently on the market and available in local restaurants. The other eight spots are filled by various new brews. We do a bunch of test batching, to see what the public likes. They kind of have input of what might be coming out next or what people are liking the most. 
 
Abide may brew just one barrel of a test brew, and never make it again. 
 
The bill was introduced the day before Georgia Beer Day, which was Saturday. Breweries all over the state, including Abide, held events and are working to advocate for passage of SB 85. 
 
In 2015, the Beer Jobs Bill originally allowed direct sales, but by the time it passed, it was considerably pared down. In the summer and fall of 2016, representatives from breweries and wholesalers met to work out a compromise, according to Travis Peterman of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild. 
 
SB 85 was introduced by Sen. Rick Jeffares, R-McDonough, chairman of the Senate Regulated Industries and Utilities Committee. 
 
With suggestions championed by both brewers and wholesalers, Lt. Governor Casey Cagle, Speaker of the House David Ralston, R-Blue Ridge, House Regulated Industries Committee Chairman Howard Maxwell, R-Dallas, and Senator Jeffares have provided guidance to create this legislation. Their commitment to supporting the small businesses of Georgia shines through in SB 85, said Nancy Palmer, Executive Director of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild. Palmer said the business leaders of Georgia Beer Wholesalers Association were also crucial in the process. 
 
Being able to have direct sales will make breweries more of an attraction or destination, and bring in tourism, Scanlan said. Thats whats happening in North Carolina and other states. Scanlan said that breweries in North Carolina have seen tremendous growth.
