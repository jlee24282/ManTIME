The event was held in Finch Fieldhouse in previous yearsbut the transition to the John G.Kulhavi Events Center is more ideal because it requires less set up than Finch and provides the same Bourbon Street feel, saidKeith Voeks, assistant director of University Events. 
 
The new location features the opportunity to walk over to the adjacent and event sponsorCourtyard Mount Pleasant at Central Michigan University,Neil said. 
 
The event was also sponsored by CMU Public Broadcasting and the Wheatland Music Organization.

Fenton graduate student Megan Piacentini came to the event mostly to try the food with her boyfriend. She said shevisited New Orleans previouslyand it was nice to experience the food, music and culture again. She also tried a "Hurricane",a popular alcoholic beveragein New Orleansthat was served at the event. 
 
Several dancers wore masks and other disguises, which business professor Jim Scott said is traditional at the actual Mardi Gras. Scott was dressed in a green frog costume complete with a red bow tie. He said he chose the disguise so he could claim to be an escaped frog from the Rayne, Louisiana Frog Festivalan event featuring frog racing and jumping, music and other activities.  
 
Neil said she was happy with the turnout of the event, which amounted to hundreds of people.  
 
"Itshows what a great community we have," she said.
