<TITLE>Judge blocks deportation of refugees stranded at U.S. airports</TITLE>
<TEXT>
NEW YORK  A federal judge blocked part of President Donald Trumps executive order on immigration Saturday evening, ordering that refugees and others trapped at airports across the United States should not be sent back to their home countries. But the judge stopped short of letting them into the country or issuing a broader ruling on the constitutionality of Trumps actions.

Lawyers who sued the government to block the White House order said the decision, which came after an emergency hearing in a New York City courtroom, could affect an estimated 100 to 200 people who were detained upon arrival at U.S. airports in the wake of the order that Trump signed Friday afternoon, a week into his presidency.
