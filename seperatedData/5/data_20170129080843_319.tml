<TITLE>HD - Warrandyte Teaser</TITLE>
<TEXT>
COMING SOON TO C31 MELBOURNE, 31DIGITAL BRISBANE AND CHANNEL 44 ADELAIDE! 
Warrandyte is such an amazing town. Not just because of its incredible beauty or rich history, but the fact that all of this lies 20 kilometres from the CBD. So next time youre looking for a weekend getaway, you may not need to travel as far as you think.
