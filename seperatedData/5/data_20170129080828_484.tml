Now, Deepika Padukone, who will essay the role of Rani Padmini in Padmavati, has responded to the attack. The actor took to Twitter to write that she was "in a state of shock" and "deeply saddened and disheartened by yesterday's events." 

 
  Movietalkies Deepika also clarified that there is no distortion of history in Padmavati, and that the makers of the film have always wanted to "share with the world the story of this courageous & powerful woman in the purest form there is."

Very very sad. Words do fall short and feel too little to express feelings. Violence is unacceptable. This incident has shocked me.
