<TITLE>A citizen legislature? Indiana lawmakers occupations not representative of states population</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Like most state legislatures, Indianas 2017 General Assembly is largely made up of business owners and lawyers. A lawmakers occupation is one of many factors that may influence how he or she legislates, but experts say it can have a big impact.

If you change the mix of occupations represented in the legislature, you change the mix of attitudes on laws, said Paul Helmke, a professor of practice at Indiana Universitys School of Public and Environmental Affairs. Its just natural.

A business owner who has had to meet a payroll will likely have a different perspective on the minimum wage issue than a laborer who has been in union contract negotiations, he said. A public school teacher probably has a different view on education policy than someone who sent their kids to a private school.

The perspective you bring when you vote, a lot of times, is based on what youre doing in life, Helmke said.

Thats why people are concerned with the race, occupation, gender and ethnicity of their elected officials, said Marjorie Hershey, professor of political science at IU.

One argument traditionally has been the more a legislature looks like the kinds of people its representing, its members really understand what the population needs and wants and will put up with, she said.

When it comes to occupations, the Indiana General Assembly doesnt exactly mirror the states workforce. According to occupational employment statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor for May 2015  the most recent available online  Indianas 92,490 retail salespersons accounted for the largest percentage of the states 2.9 million workers. Combined food preparation and service workers made up the second-largest category, with 84,250 people.

Nearly 30 percent of the Indiana General Assemblys 150 members are business owners, by far the largest occupation category in a Hoosier-Times analysis. The Legislatures 24 lawyers or attorneys make up the second-largest category, at about 15 percent.

The Department of Labors data set did not include a category specifically for business owners, but lawyers made up about 0.2 percent of the states workforce.

Its not surprising that certain professions are more common in state legislatures than in the general population. Serving in the legislature and campaigning for an election takes time, between both regular sessions, interim committees and elections every two or six years. In general, its easier for someone who is self-employed to adjust their schedule than someone working on an assembly line, Hershey said.

Lawyers and business owners may also be more aware of the effect of specific legislation. Helmke practiced law for more than 14 years before becoming mayor of Fort Wayne in 1987. He said practicing lawyers often come across laws they feel are unjust or dont make sense, so they run for office to try and change things. Its a similar situation with business owners.

If you run a small business, like an insurance agency, a small manufacturing thing, a floral shop, whatever, youre used to dealing with governmental regulations and taxes, he said. So you run for the legislature.

That seems to be true throughout the country. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 15 percent of legislators in all states listed attorney as their occupation in 2007, while more than 9 percent owned a business. The only more prevalent occupation was full-time legislator, at about 16 percent. Legislator is a full-time position in some states, but its still considered part time in Indiana.

Thats what Hoosiers wanted, said James Madison, emeritus professor of history at IU.

We had what you used to call a citizen legislature. It was part time, not professional, he said. From the people, of the people, by the people and for the people. Thats what Hoosiers wanted. They wanted their neighbors to represent them.

But some neighbors were better suited to take on such duties while continuing to support themselves and their families. Thats why lawyers, doctors, business owners and farmers were common professions in the Indiana Legislature for most of the states history. Over the past half century, though, there have been some changes.

The Legislature now meets every year, as opposed to every other year when it was founded. There is more pressure to prepare outside of regular sessions and work on summer study commissions, Madison said.

Its a demanding job if you want to do it well, he said.

Indianas economy also changed. There are fewer farmers, and the Legislature reflects that. According to The Centennial History of The Indiana General Assembly, more than 800 farmers served in the state Legislature from 1816 to 1851, accounting for more than half of all the members who served during that period. That figure was down to about a quarter from 1891 to 1929, and about 8 percent for the period from 1971 to 1984. Today, only one Indiana legislator claims farming as his primary occupation, although others do own farms. State Rep. Dave Heine, R-Fort Wayne, owns and operates a family farm, according to his biography on the Indiana House of Representatives Republican Caucus website.

There are also fewer lawyers. After peaking at 32 percent of legislators who served from 1851 to 1889, the number of lawyers has steadily fallen to about 20 percent of those who served from 1971 to 1984. Helmke thinks this is because there are more lawyers. With more competition and increasing demands of state legislators, some have decided doing both is too much.

Those changes are consistent with national trends. A 2015 article from the Pew Charitable Trust showed the percentage of farmers has fallen to 4.6 percent, half of what it was in 1976. The percentage of lawyers has fallen, too, from 22.3 in 1976 to 14.4 percent in 2015.

On the flip side, professions that have seen increasing representation among state lawmakers include consultants and nonprofit workers. The share of lawmakers in that occupational category increased from about 3 percent in 1986 to 8.2 percent in 2015. The percentage of legislators who say lawmaking is their main profession has also risen, from 2.7 percent in 1976 to 16.4 percent in 2015.

Indiana only partially follows that trend. State Rep. Karen Engleman, a Republican from Harrison County, is the only member of the Indiana General Assembly to list state representative as her occupation. State Rep. Carey Hamilton, a Democrat from Indianapolis, is the only member of the General Assembly who lists her main occupation as being a leader in the nonprofit sector. She is the executive director of the Indiana Recycling Coalition.

Consultants, though, make up about 6 percent of Indiana legislators. State Sen. Mark Stoops, a Democrat from Bloomington, is one of those.

The graphic design and marketing consultant said the time commitment required to serve in the Statehouse, and the pay, can be a huge hurdle for some people. Indiana legislators receive a base salary of $25,435.98 plus a per diem ranging from $161 to $175, depending on the month. They can also earn additional pay for leadership positions.

I think if you just have a standard 9-to-5 job, theres no way you can do it, Stoops said.

As a result, the perspectives of business owners and white-collar professionals are far more prevalent than those of hourly employees or laborers. Whether thats good or bad depends on the kind of government people want.

If people want their representatives to really understand and speak for them, then their representatives have to be people like them, said Hershey, the political science professor. If instead they want a system governed by people who are more educated, wealthier and more cosmopolitan than they are, thats fine, but thats a very different kind of system.

Attempts to speak with state Sen. Eric Koch, a Republican from Bedford who owns a law firm, were unsuccessful.
