<TITLE>Greeleys Father Daughter Dance goes Hollywood</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Joe Thrutchley has taken his daughters to the Father Daughter Dance at the Greeley Recreation Center for seven years. This years Hollywood Red Carpet theme meant they got the star treatment. 
 
I thought it was the best because I got to wear my tux shirt, he said with a laugh, wearing a fake tuxedo shirt. 
 
About 250 fathers and daughters showed up for the Saturday afternoon dance that Thrutchley and his daughters attended. Greeley offers the dance at different times to help fathers with different schedules get a chance to bond with their daughters. Including the Friday evening and Saturday evening dance, almost 1,800 attended this weekend. From baby girls to adult women, daughters of all ages showed up with their fathers. 
 
Its great to see all the other dads getting together with their daughters and having a good time, Thrutchley said. Were making memories here thatll last forever. 
 
Thrutchley took his three daughters Shiloh, Coty and Hannah. At 18, Hannah said the dance provides her with a special opportunity. 
 
I dont live at home anymore, so its nice to be able to spend time with my dad and quality time with my sisters, she said. 
 
Denver-based special events crew Paparazzi Red Carpet contributed to the Hollywood atmosphere. As cameras flashed and paparazzi yelled, fathers and daughters got a taste of what it feels like to be a star. 
 
I like how they did the red carpet with the paparazzi, said Coty, 14. I thought that was really cute. 
 
And it kind of makes us feel glamorous, her father said with a chuckle. 
 
Outside of the dancing, daughters had the opportunity to make a star collage thanks to volunteers from the Delta Zeta sorority at the University of Northern Colorado. Elvis impersonator George Gray showed up in his bright white Elvis costume, brightening the faces of both young and old. Thrutchley said the dance has grown into something special for his family. 
 
I just hope they keep doing it. One year we heard that they might stop doing it, and I was crushed, he said. This is definitely a tradition for us. 
 
Recreation supervisor Andrea Haring said organizing the event isnt easy, but always worth it. 
 
Out of all my duties I have for the city  this is my most favorite, Haring said. Its so worth it. Leading up to it, Im nervous, Im excited,  and then at the end, its awesome.
