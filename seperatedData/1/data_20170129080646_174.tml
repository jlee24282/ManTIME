ALEXANDRIA, Minn.  Bonnie (Nelson) Bearson-Aken, 80, died on Jan. 27, 2017. 
   
Ms. Bearson-Aken was born on Dec. 27, 1936, in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, the only child of Fred and Emma (Hanson) Nelson. After attending Hemlock School in Eau Claire County, she graduated from Mondovi (Wis.) High School in 1954. She attended Eau Claire Vocational School (now Eau Claire Technical College), then was employed by General Casualty Company of Wisconsin in its Eau Claire office. She married the Rev. William H. Bearson on March 1, 1958, at Calvary Baptist Church in Eau Claire. They had three children. The couple served churches in Albertville, Wisconsin, Easton, Missouri, and Minneapolis. She taught Sunday school for many years and played piano and organ in the churches they served. While in the Minneapolis area she worked as a word processor for Pako Corporation, then as executive secretary for the chairman of the board and the chief financial officer of Pako. Later she worked in human resources. In 1983, she began working for Berkley Risk Administrators in Minneapolis and retired in 2001. 
   
After retirement she moved to Alexandria, where in 2003 she married Ronald L. Aken, a retired Air Force senior master sergeant. They wintered for several years in Arizona City, where she played the organ at Arizona City Evangelical Methodist Church. They enjoyed the fellowship of many new friends during those years. She also enjoyed music, reading, crocheting, backyard bird watching and, most of all, spending time with her children and grandchildren.
