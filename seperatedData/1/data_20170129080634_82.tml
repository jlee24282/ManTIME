CONCORD - Last year, New Hampshire State Police saved people from jumping off bridges and rescued a distraught woman who tried to drown herself in a river. They solved the 2011 murder of 11-year-old Celina Cass, made numerous drug busts and helped capture a man who shot two Manchester police officers. 

On Friday, more than 400 people gathered at New Hampshire Police Standards and Training Council to honor them. 

Trooper Nicholas Levesque, a four-year veteran, received three awards: The Director's Award, for making 245 arrests last year, 90 of them related to drugs; a Medal of Service for his efforts in arresting a man charged with shooting those Manchester police officers, and a commendation for his efforts in the Drug Monitor Initiative. 

Levesque and Trooper First Class Francesco Campo were working a construction detail on Interstate 93 in Manchester on May 13, 2016, when they heard the call that an officer had been shot. 

The two troopers arrived on scene, working with Manchester police officers to secure the area and track down the shooter. Levesque saw the suspect, later identified as Ian MacPherson, 32, of Manchester, who by then allegedly had shot a second officer. MacPherson ignored Levesque, who shot at him, but missed. 

Campo, who also received the Medal of Meritorious Service, and Levesque followed MacPherson to woods where he ran. A Massachusetts State Police helicopter flushed him out and MacPherson was arrested. He is charged with two counts of attempted murder and first degree assault. 

Levesque said the two officers who were shot, Ryan Hardy and Matt O'Connor, are good friends of his. They met while attending The Academy at the New Hampshire Police Standards and Training Council. 

Levesque said he was just happy he could do his job every day and "work with the troopers that I do." 

Trooper Jonathan D. Minnich received a Lifesaving Award. He had tried to contact a man to return property to him. When, after several days, the man didn't call back, on May 3, 2016, Minnich went to his home where he found him on a floor, unable to move because of a medical issue. 

Without Minnich stopping by the man's home, "the individual certainly would have died," Col. Christopher Wagner said. 

Auxiliary Trooper Charles West received the Director's Award and the Lt. James J. Geraghty Investigative Award. Geraghty, who died in 2014, was with the major crimes unit for eight years. 

Cass went missing on July 26, 2011, and her body was found five days later in the Connecticut River, a short distance from her West Stewartstown home. 

No one was arrested until nearly five years later and after West pored over evidence, including hundreds of interviews, resulting in the arrest of Celina's stepfather, Wendell Noyes, on June 20, 2016. 

Lifesaving Awards were given to Trooper Bryan C. Tracy , who went 100 yards into a river to rescue a woman trying to drown herself; Troopers Mark Dore, Geoffrey Rogan and Jacob Wood saved a man on Sept. 11, 2016, who was dangling from a bridge after he ran from them following a police chase on the Everett Turnpike; Lt. Joseph Ebert, Sgt. John Hennessey, Trooper First Class Brian Gacek and troopers Jeffrey Costa and John Forbes saved the life of a woman as she tried to jump off the bridge spanning the Piscataqua River at the Maine/New Hampshire border.
