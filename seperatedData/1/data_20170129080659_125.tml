Kim Kardashianwas robbed in Paris seem a bit  different  including that lip ring! 
 
Maybe its a new filter and not a big deal, but still, these pics dont reflect the Kim were used to seeing. Although Kims latest photos do feature her sweet family, theyre grainier, blurrier, and a little more dark. Who knows, maybe Kims new snaps represent how shes feeling after that unthinkable ordeal  or maybe theyre meant to be dramatic in some artistic Polaroid-inspired way.
