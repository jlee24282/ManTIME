Darweesh spent a decade working for the United States military in Iraq as an interpreter and engineer and had been granted an entry visa after background checks; Alshawi had been granted a visa in order to join his wife and son who are already permanent residents of the US after their similar service with the US military.xJudge: "Class is pretty well defined as outline in the papers - otherwise would be reviewing stays for a hundred people" so stay is national Jackie Vimo January 29, 2017x4 factors have been met: Irreparable harm established, likelihood of success on merits, no harm to govt.
