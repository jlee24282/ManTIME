<TITLE>Investigate Ayarigas bribery allegations  Rashid Pelpuo</TITLE>
<TEXT>
A former Minority Leader in Ghanas Parliament, Rashid Pelpuo has called for investigations into bribery allegations made by the Member of Parliament for the Bawku Central Constituency, Mahama Ayariga against the Energy Minister, Boakye Agyarko. 
 
Mr. Ayariga had accused the Energy Minister of bribing the ten minority members on the Appointments Committee with GHc3, 000 to lure them to approve him for the position. 
 
According to him the money was handed to them by the minority chief whip, Muntaka Mubarak who received it from the chairman of the Appointments Committee, Joseph Osei-Owusu. 
 
Meanwhile, Ayarigas claim has been rubbished by all the factions involved. 
 
Speaking on The Big Issue on Saturday, Rashid Pelpuo who is also the Member of Parliament for Wa Central said if you have a member of the committee coming out with these tough allegations, it is important for us to look at it thoroughly. 
 
There must be some information derived out of it and a position that would have emerged upon which you would have then made such a powerful statement. For me I cannot say much because Im not a member of the committee, I can only rely on what the witness is talking about and what emphasis he is putting across, he noted. 
 
I didnt give Ayariga bribe money  Muntaka swears 
 
Minority chief whip, Mubarak Mohammed Muntaka says it is untrue he gave Mahama Ayariga money meant to bribe him [Ayariga] and other minority members of Parliaments appointment committee to support the approval of Energy Minister, Boakye Agyarko. 
 
According to him, he does not recall ever giving Ayariga any gift purportedly from the Chairman of the Appointments Committee [Joseph Osei-Owusu]. 
 
Im a Muslim and Ayariga is a Muslim. Im swearing by the Allah that created him that I never gave Ayariga anything and I said it was from Osei-Owusu. Osei Owusu has never discussed any money issue with me. He has never given me any money to be given to Ayariga and Ive never given Ayariga or anybody any money saying that it was coming from the Chairman.
