<TITLE>LGBT topic not up for discussion at Christian festival</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Craig Watson was part of a group that had a stall a Christian music festival Festival One. The group was told to take down all references to sexuality and LBGT. 
  
A conversation about sexuality and gender diversity has been hushed at a Christian music festival. 
 
Craig Watson was part of a group that paid about $6000 for astall at Festival One, centred aroundlesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues (LGBT) and sexuality. 
 
Festival One, which was held at Mystery Creek from January 27-30,is an all ages Christian music festival that is drug andalcoholfree. It has been running for the past three years and was started after Christian musicfestivalParachute stopped running in 2014. 
 
As well as music, the festival'swebsite says it offersseminars on a whole range of topics that invite and encourage discussion. 
 
 
 
 
 
Inviting and encouraging discussion was exactly what TheWilderpeoplestall was about, said Watson. Its aimwas to promote conversationsaround sexuality anddiversity, and aligning that with the Christian faith. It wasrun by a Christian group calledIncendo. 
 
The stall openly displayed signs that read "Gay", "Lesbian" and "Transgender". News clips about LGBTissuescould be viewed, with headphones for audio. One video was adocumentary about a lesbian couple who were bringing up a child within the Christian faith. 
 
But one day into the festivalthe organisers decided the material was not appropriate and the group was asked to remove it. This was despite the organisers approving the application which explained the group's intention. 
 
Watson said none of the material was offensive but the group agreed to change the stall and removed the material, opting instead to offer face painting. 
 
After staying another day, they decided on Saturday toremove the stall altogether. 
 
After initially refusing to comment, Festival One chief executive Graham Burt andIncendoreleased a joint statement on Sunday afternoon: "Incendo and Festival One state that the Wilderpeople Collective accepted that the Wilderpeople Collective could not meet expectations of Festival One organisers about what their presence in the Wilder Precinct should be. Therefore the WilderpeopleCollective decided to withdraw their stall." 
 
There has been a discussion about a refund for the stall, Watson said. 
 
Watson, who is a gay Christian, said Festival One was a great place to start aconversation about LGBT issues. 
 
"Festival One is a Christian Music festival, and theonlyone in New Zealand, and it attracts a large number of young adults and youth. We know that there is a large number of these young people who are exploring andwanting to talk aboutsexualityand gender identity. It's a huge thing for a young person but in the Christian sector it's morecomplicatedbecause you've then got afaith that has been very much rooted in your upbringing thatunless you are a straight, normal person then you are an abomination anddestinedfor hell. 
 
"I believethat it's right to get themessageout there that it's important to have these conversations and that it's important to talk about so it doesn't lead todepressionand suicide which we see in a lot of young people in New Zealand," Watson said. 
 
"I think it's just a clear indication of how we are as a Christian journey with this topic. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done. To not be able to use those words at a camp that is predominantlyfull of teenagers and adults is a clear indication of what's going on. 
 
"For me it's just a sign that we are still not there, we are still quite judgmental when it comes to Christians and churches accepting people with different views."
