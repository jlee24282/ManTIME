<TITLE>Colin Hay Of Men At Work Takes Us To The Land Down Under During iHeart80s Party</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We're ready to hop on a plane to The Land Down Under, AKA Australia, AKA The Land of Wombats as so eloquently put by Colin Hay of Men At Work during his performance at the iHeart80s Party in San Jose, California at the SAP Center this weekend (Jan. 28). 
 
In 1983, Men At Work became the first Australian artists to have a No. 1 album and No. 1 single on the United States Billboard charts simultaneously ( Business as Usual and "Down Under"). So it would NOT be an 80s party without some of that Men At Work music we know and love. 
 
{ "position1" : { "type" : "live", "id" : 5060, "name" : "iHeart80s Radio", "description" : "Commercial-Free 80s Hits" } } 
 
Colin has released quite a few solo albums over the years, and so to kick off his iHeart80s Party performance, performed his recent solo single "Tumbling Down." 
 
From there, he took us down memory lane with songs like "Who Can It Be Now," "It's A Mistake," "Overkill," "Be Good Johnny," and (of course) "Down Under."
