<TITLE>NH GOP votes to pay new chairman departing chair calls for GOP to embrace gay marriage</TITLE>
<TEXT>
DERRY  A historic move to pay its top leader and a surprising call from the departing chairman to end opposition to same-sex marriage sparked a lively annual meeting of the Republican State Committee here Saturday. 
 

The GOP ended a decade-long debate with a 268-90 vote for its Executive Committee to craft a salary package for the new chairman, former Senate Finance Committee Chairman Jeanie Forrester of Meredith. The vote cleared a required, two-thirds threshold. 
 
Steve Stepanek of Amherst, co-chairman of President Trumps New Hampshire campaign, capped off this push of the state GOP leadership to join Democrats that, for more than a decade, have paid Chairman Raymond Buckley of Manchester a six-figure, annual salary. 
 

It is a long time coming. We need to be competitive, Stepanek said during debate at Pinkerton Academys Stockbridge Theatre. 
 

We have got to compensate people if we are going to have a person working 60, 70 hours a week making sure we are red from top to bottom. 
 

But Jeff Chidester, a conservative activist from Portsmouth, said the provision was far too open-ended. 
 

Does anybody know what this position is going to get paid? Is there going to be a commission? Chidester asked rhetorically. 
 

I am not opposed to paying for this position; I am opposed to the fact that it is not being clearly defined. 
 

Supporters said pay should be performance-based and tied to reaching fund-raising goals but Forrester said she has no preconceived ideas on it. 
 

I didnt expect that big of a vote, Forrester said. 
 

It goes to the Executive Committee that gets to decide as it sees fit. This is a conversation we need to have. 
 

Meanwhile, departing Chairwoman Jennifer Horn of Nashua made news by calling for the state GOP to fulfill two promises: To reaffirm its opposition to all abortions and to end the state party platform being against same-sex marriage. 
 

We must put an end to be a party that actively works to deny rights to a small group of people based on who we are, Horn said. 
 

We are the party of equal rights for all, so lets remove the language that is against the right for all people to marry. 
 

Her emotional plea was met with only a few dozen among the 368 committee members standing up to applaud while there was a smattering of boos. 
 

Outgoing Vice Chairman Matt Mayberry of Dover made his own plea for gays and veterans to get more support from the state GOP. 
 

I am talking to the person who is gay who thinks because they are gay they dont belong to the GOP. You are wrong, said Mayberry, an Air Force veteran. I am one of those veterans who thought about committing suicide. The letters were written; because of strong friends and my faith, I came to understand that I was loved. 
Stepanek did not believe the GOP would soon change its platform plank on gay marriage. 
 

I respect Jennifer and congratulate her on doing a fine job. Those are her personal views and only the entire state committee gets to decide what goes in or out of the platform, Stepanek said. 
 

Gov. Chris Sununu bristled at House Democratic Leader Steve Shurtleffs prediction earlier in the week that the House would kill Right to Work after Senate passage of it last week. 
 

One of the first pieces of big legislation and we are going to let the Democrats dictate what we do? I dont think so, Sununu declared to a standing ovation. 
 

House Speaker Shawn Jasper, R-Hudson, brought up what he called rumors that he lacked commitment to Right to Work. 
 

The bill will be on the floor Feb. 15th and I will be on the floor at my seat, not at the rostrum, and I will be voting for Right to Work, Jasper declared. 
 

Forrester vowed the party would do a better job enlisting as partners with business owners and local town committees. 
 

I heard from a lot of businesses whose leaders said they had not been engaged; we need to change that, Forrester said.A Democratic Party spokesman said citizens will come to see Forrester, a 2016 candidate for governor, as an ideologue who cant be trusted. 
 

Jeanie Forrester has always had a penchant for bizarre statements, but the past week since President Trump took office has us concerned for inter-party dialogue here in New Hampshire, said Democratic Party Press Secretary Zach McNamara. 
 

In a single week Forrester has been caught in two separate lies during partisan attacks, demonstrating a Trump-style disregard for the truth. New Hampshire politics has always had a strongly independent streak, and its disappointing to see the NH GOPs new leader taking lessons from this White House. 
 

McNamara said Forrester accused Democrat Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter of going to a cocktail party instead of to the inauguration of President Trump, and she had referred to the Democracy in Color DNC meeting as a bizarre, anti-white forum. 
 

In other elections, Wayne MacDonald of Derry became vice chairman, edging Dan Hynes of Merrimack by three votes. 
 

The GOP upheld Horns suspension of Joe Barton of Newmarket as a state committeeman after charging Barton supported independent U.S. Senate candidate Aaron Day over then-incumbent Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-NH.
