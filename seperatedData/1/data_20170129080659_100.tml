It is the island which has inspired tales of supernatural devil dogs and bodies buried without skulls. 
 
Now, thanks to erosion, the real history of Deadmans Island off Kents north coast is being exposed. 
 
More than two centuries ago, the island, which lies opposite the Isle of Sheppey, was used as a burial ground for convicts who died on floating prisons, known as prison hulks. 
 
Coffins and bones can now be found sticking out of the mud.
