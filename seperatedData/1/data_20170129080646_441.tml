<TITLE>The flowers who came in from the cold</TITLE>
<TEXT>
By Geraniums are like the girl-next-door of flowers. Theyre nice, unassuming, and efficient. 
 
Perhaps that  and the fact that theyre everywhere  explains how we routinely look past them. I mean you dont hear people saying My geraniums are having a banner year. And you would never think to transpose the wording A rose by any other name would smell as sweet with geranium. 
 
Blame it on their unfussy, reliable nature. They are used almost without thinking to fill a void. 
 
And yet, in a different setting  beyond the window box or graveyard  during a different season, a geranium suddenly transforms into the It-Girl of the flower kingdom. 
 
Well, that is how it seemed the other day coming in from a routine walk around the neighborhood, feeling a bit down in the mouth, everything saturated in monochromatic shades of grey and brown and bleak as January often is without the snow. 
 
I was hunched over, removing my boots in the front entrance, and I saw them saluting me in their winsome way, against the dreary winter world outdoors. 
 
I nodded appreciatively and reached for my camera, happy for the momentary pick-me-up. 
 
Common garden geraniums (not to be confused with the hardy, sprawling cranesbill perennial of a different family) properly fall under the genus known as pelargoniums originating from South Africa and comprised of four different groups known in botanical circles as 1) Show or Fancy pelargoniums, 2) Zonal geraniums 3) Ivy-leaved geraniums 4) Scented geraniums. 
 
Under discussion here are zonal geraniums that have been bred for size, abundance and color, resulting in ever-increasing variety. Maybe because of this and their rather flashy colors, they have been snubbed as ordinary. 
 
Although they are prevalent, they hold a special place in my heart, stemming from the fact that they were one of the first plants I took note of as a child exploring my limited environments. 
 
My maternal grandma was a busy woman (an understatement having raised 12 children and helping out with many more grandchildren) and yet her house had those classic bright red flowers decorating the window boxes. I can recall standing on tiptoes to see them. 
 
At my other grandmothers house, I remember the plants taking over the spacious windowsills of their small family-run grocery shop above which the family lived. 
 
And I loved seeing them year after year as part of the scenery, practically encroaching (a bit like Little Shop of Horrors) on the shelves of comestibles, toiletries such as Brylcreem, the sacred altar of penny candy and a huge walk in butchers freezer. 
 
Again and again over time, geraniums have enveloped me in foreign ports and hometown alike! With that kind of history its no wonder I continue to propagate them. 
 
There are three ways you can go with your geraniums once they have seen you through the summer season. You can let them die as annuals (a wasteful proposition if you ask me), bring them indoors as houseplants or take cuttings and make more plants. 
 
There is another option: dormant storage without soil. In this way their means of survival is through their thick, succulent-like stems. It is done by shaking off the soil from the roots after digging the plants up in fall. Then by hanging them upside-down in open paper bags from the rafters in a cool (45-50 degree), dark location for the winter. 
 
Two or three times during the winter you need to remove the plants and soak the roots in water for a couple of hours. Discard any with shriveled stems and in late March pot up the survivors. Water and cut back the stem tips, placing them in a sunny window to initiate growth. This phase will take several weeks. 
 
If you choose to overwinter them instead, keep them tidy and occasionally pinch them to keep plants in proportion and encourage growth, watering when the soil begins to dry. 
 
It is advisable to change the soil to a potting soil which is looser than most garden soil and therefore easier for drainage. When May arrives add fertilizer and transplant  youre plants will have a head start. 
 
To grow new plants from cuttings, use cuttings 3 to 5 inches long of young, short jointed shoots in early September. 
 
Insert in a mix of two-parts soil and one-part sand, placing five of these around the edge of a 5-inch pot. Water and stand in shady position outside or in cool greenhouse for two weeks, by which time a callus will have formed. Move to a sunny position in the greenhouse or cold frame. 
 
When well-rooted pot singly in 3 inch pots, using potting mix and repotting in February or early March in 5 inch pots where they will stay until being planted in the garden at the end of May. Water sparingly during the winter or stems will rot and die. Temperature should be 45-60 degrees. Remove flower buds until April. 
 
New plants produced from cuttings should be vigorous and about the same size as most geraniums sold in spring. 
 
This type of geranium grows well in ordinary garden soil, if not too rich in nitrogen, which makes the plants develop fleshy stems and leaves but few flowers. Plant in light, sunny position never in complete shade. 
 
If theres one secret to growing good-looking geraniums, its sunshine, states James Underwood Crockett in his book (one of my steadies) Crocketts Indoor Garden. The more sun they get the more flowers they produce. 
 
And that makes this girl next door very happy.
