<TITLE>Protests against Trump's Muslim ban spring up around the country</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Donald Trump says its"working out very nicely,"but his Muslim ban isnt justdetaining grandmothers in airports, its leading to massive, organic protest around the country.Airportsare a major focus of protest, since thats where people are being detained as they seek to enter the country.Hundreds have protested at JFK airportin New York. And in Boston.The arrivals area atDulles airportwas crowded with protesters and refugees welcome signs, while Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe directed his states attorney general to look at all avenues to help people detained there. Acandlelight vigil is planned at LAXfor Saturday evening. A protest inPortlanddisrupted light rail service.The protests have led to inspiring scenes of resistance but we should not have to resist this. What this president is doingis so ugly that even knowing he did not win the popular vote, even polling showing the nation is not behind him, cannot protect Americas reputation. Only fighting backand winning, however long that takes, can begin to make this right.
