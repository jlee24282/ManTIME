<TITLE>Wisconsin woods to Valley thorn scrub: Laguna volunteer likes the trade</TITLE>
<TEXT>
LOS FRESNOS  Were not in Wisconsin anymore. 
 
Peggy Wagner is a volunteer at Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge here, working the front desk in the Visitors Center. 
 
Wagner and her husband, Jeff, became full-time RVers in May and relocated to the Rio Grande Valley. 
 
This is our first volunteer position, so Ive been here since the beginning of November and am enjoying it immensely, said Wagner. The people who come are wonderful people, as well as the volunteers I work with. 
 
The Tamaulipan thorn scrub that dominates much of the landscape of Laguna Atascosa stands in sharp contrast to the Wisconsin northwoods she left behind. 
 
Lake Nebagamon sits in the deep snow zone in the north of the state, just south of the western tip of Lake Superior. 
 
Some of the animals here  I hadnt even heard of an ocelot before, Wagner said. So now I know what one looks like, as well as some of the characteristics of it. 
 
Seeing the terrain here is totally different from what Im used to up in Wisconsin, she said, so its really interesting  a real learning experience for me. 
 
The beauty of South Texas isnt the only thing shes appreciating these days. 
 
Wagner finished her 35-year education career in Wisconsin where she taught kindergarten. 
 
The rewards are the satisfaction of knowing that youre giving back, she said. I really like that because all through my working career I didnt have the opportunity to just do something that I wanted to volunteer for. 
 
Its a feeling of accomplishment and pride in the fact that you can really give back, she said.
