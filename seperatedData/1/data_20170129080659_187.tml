<TITLE>Substitute jobs could open doors</TITLE>
<TEXT>
WESTERLY  Working as a substitute teacher would be ideal for Angel-Lena Smith, of Westerly, a certified paraprofessional who is studying part time for her teaching certificate. 
 
I would like to get into the district to have my name known  the ideal schedule would be about three days a week, she said. Its all about networking, so by the time Im finished with school to be a teacher, that way Id already be in the district. 
 
Smith, 30, was among a steady stream of applicants who attended the school districts Winter Open House at the Westerly High School cafeteria Saturday. The event served as a job fair for substitute positions as teachers, paraprofessionals, custodians, and bus drivers.

Zone change requested for artist guesthouses 
  
Kimberly Sihavong, director of human resources, said 81 people had registered for the event as of 10 a.m. 
 
Im really impressed with the turnout  its the first time weve done this so I was a little nervous, she said. Westerly is facing a substitute shortage, which is kind of a nationwide problem, and with all the kids that graduate from college in December, theres a ton of people looking for jobs and theres not a lot of jobs because its mid-school year and this it gives them an opportunity to become employed, to find a home in the district. 
 
In Rhode Island, substitute teaching requires a bachelors degree but no longer requires a substitute certificate. In Westerly, the substitute per diem rate is $80, which Sihavong said was pretty average since $70 to $100 per day is the range statewide. 
 
Sihavong said she didnt currently have any full-time teacher openings and wouldnt know until late spring how many positions would open up because of retirements and resignations. 
 
Substituting can be a good career choice for those looking to get their foot in the door to eventually get a job as a teacher, but it requires dedication and commitment, she said. 
 
Subbing is like test-driving a car  every school district is different and its a good way for them to see if its a good place for them to end up permanently, she said. She noted that good candidates care about the community, they care about the kids, they want to become involved; theyre not just coming in, doing the work and leaving  theyre engaging with us. 
 
For Harvey Blanchette, 36, of Westerly, substitute teaching would mesh well with his parenting duties and his desire to teach. 
 
I saw the ad online and I thought it was kind of a nice opportunity and Ive been thinking about getting into education for a really long time, he said. Im a stay-at-home dad with a lot going on so it seems like a nice chance to test the waters 
 
Working on a per diem basis would provide flexibility, he said. 
 
Im responsible for my daughters most of the time and Id be able to find coverage pretty quickly, he said. Its tough to have a full-time job because then youre paying for day care for the entire span of time  working a couple days a week is more manageable. 
 
Nicole Fortunato, 23, came all the way from her home in Ramsey, New Jersey, to apply for the open house. A 2015 graduate of Roger Williams University, she has worked for two years as a teaching assistant in New Jersey. 
 
They emailed that they were having the open house and I thought it was a good networking opportunity, she said. I am trying to become an elementary school teacher and I want to come back to Rhode Island. Ive been a teaching assistant for two years and Im ready to teach on my own. 
 
Westerly High School Principal Todd Grimes said he was pleased with the caliber of applicants at the event. 
 
I didnt know what to expect but Ive had some really great conversations today with some potential employees, he said. Substitute teaching, he added, is a challenging position  you need to have strong communication skills, be flexible and adaptable and work well with people because you never know what to expect and every assignment may be different.
