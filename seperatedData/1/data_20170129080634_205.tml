<TITLE>Jim Flynn: Trump's war on regulations leads back to Congress</TITLE>
<TEXT>
As you probably know, President Donald Trump has declared war on "regulations." There seems, however, to be some misinformation here and some irony. On the misinformation front, contrary to what you might have concluded from campaign rhetoric, "regulations" don't just come into existence at the whim of a president. They start with Congress. 
 
The term "regulation" is often used incorrectly to refer to an actual statute passed by Congress - for example, the Affordable Care Act. The term is correctly used to refer to rules created by government agencies implementing statutes passed by Congress - for example, Regulation B, implementing the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. 
 
Either way - statute or true regulation - Congress is the fundamental source of whatever people railing against "regulations" are unhappy about. Even executive orders, which are sometimes used as a controversial end run around the normal process of creating regulations, must find justification in an act of Congress. 
 
So, a war on "regulations" is, in fact, a war on prior legislative acts of Congress, with the real argument being that we have too darn many laws and they are getting in the way of innovation, economic efficiency, freedom of speech, the ability to get good seats for the Super Bowl, etc. 
 
True regulations come about because Congress, when passing a statute, has given instructions to a government agency to create rules filling in details the statute left unresolved. The agency then drafts a proposed regulation, publishes the draft in the Federal Register, solicits comment from anyone who might be affected by the regulation, holds hearings, listens to incessant babble from lobbyists, revises the draft and promulgates the final regulation. 
 
While it may be that, on occasion, a regulation will push the boundaries of a statute beyond what some members of Congress would like, most of the time the regulation drafting agency is just doing what Congress told it to do - that is, refine and implement the statute. 
 
On the irony front, businesses that operate fairly and honorably, and do not rely on false promises to sell their goods and services, are often wanting regulations. Regulations have the effect of weeding out bad actors and allowing businesses that believe in honesty to compete in an ethical environment. 
 
A good example of this, among many, might be the Truth In Lending Act and its implementing regulation, Regulation Z. This body of law - part statute and part regulation - has allowed ethical providers of consumer credit (mortgage companies, auto lenders, credit card issuers, etc.) to compete based on the quality and price of their products and services and has helped to keep deceitful players off the field. 
 
True regulations issued by the executive departments and agencies of the federal government are assembled in a publication called the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). CFR consists of 50 titles, with each title tied generally to the agency responsible for the regulations in that title. The Office of the Federal Register, a part of the National Archives and Records Administration, and the Government Publishing Office are responsible for the upkeep of CFR. If you're interested, CFR is available in most libraries and online at several sites. 
 
Colorado and all other states have regulations interpreting and implementing state statutes. These regulations are created through a process similar to the federal process - drafting, publication, public comment, etc. Colorado's regulations are assembled in the Code of Colorado Regulations (CCR), maintained by the Colorado Secretary of State's office.
