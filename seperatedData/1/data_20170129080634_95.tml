RYAN 

THE TWO quarterbacks in next Sunday's Super Bowl are very much alike. 

Matt Ryan , as you probably know, did his matriculating at Boston College, not all that far from Foxborough. And those of us at the beginning of his college days saw that a young college Ryan was a lot like a young pro Tom Brady . 

Do the right things. Say the right things. I nicknamed the kid Senator Ryan the first time we met him. It's easy to see either him or Brady running for office some day. 

BC players were long tutored on dealing with the press by SIDs Chris Cameron and the late (and sorely missed) Dick Kelley . Ryan didn't need much tutoring. He always got it, on and off the field. 

Just like Brady. 

"Tom's had an unbelievable year, played extremely well and extremely efficient," Ryan said the other day. "A lot of touchdowns, very few turnovers. He's just been playing really good football. He's been that way for a long time. He's been consistent throughout his career. He's such a great player, such a great competitor. 

"He's been a friend for a long time; I've gotten to know him since I've been in the league, and certainly he's a good person and a good guy to talk to." 

So they talk? 

"For sure, back and forth during the season, letting him know he's doing a good job," Ryan said. "I see the highlights, and I think it's the same for him. That's the fraternity at the quarterback position. You get to know guys playing against them . and he's one of the good guys, and a really good person." 

MVPs super drought 

Ryan the regular season MVP? Brady? 

Credit to friend Ken Powtak for pointing out an NFL MVP hasn't won a Super Bowl since Kurt Warner back in 1999. 

There have been 11 players who have done it, including five between the 1993 and '99 seasons. But none since Warner. 

One of them was Washington kicker Mark Moseley , who pulled it off in the strike-shortened 1982 season. A kicker! 

Sunday leftovers 

Logan Ryan was wearing a throwback Houston Astros jersey after the AFC title game. Which one? Nolan Ryan 's No. 34 of course. 

If you missed Martellus Bennett 's words about getting to the Super Bowl, here's a rewind. 

"Honestly, over the years I never really felt like the Super Bowl was a possibility," he said. "I was talking to my wife this morning. I'm like, 'I don't really know how to feel about going into this game.' I always dreamed about going to the Super Bowl but it never really felt like an attainable goal in the past because we lost so many games (with the Cowboys, Giants and Bears) and we were never really in position. 

"You're just hopeful to go to the playoffs. So this is very special. It's a dream come true." 

Stars in Cleveland 

Kudos go out to my pal Paul Hoynes of Cleveland.com for breaking the news his town and the Indians will host the 2019 All-Star Game. 

Then, in a follow-up story, Hoynsie looked back at the 1997 game, also hosted by Cleveland, and noted there were 16 future Hall of Famers - 14 players and managers Joe Torre and Bobby Cox - in the game. 

Ken Griffey Jr. , Cal Ripken Jr. , Pudge Rodriguez , Roberto Alomar , Frank Thomas , Randy Johnson , Craig Biggio , Tony Gwynn , Mike Piazza , Jeff Bagwell , Greg Maddux , Barry Larkin , Tom Glavine and Pedro Martinez were the players. 

The American League won the game on a home run by the Indians' Sandy Alomar Jr . 

Speaking of the Indians, Hoynsie Facebooked: "Indians will unveil statues of Hall of Famers Frank Robinson (May 27) and Lou Boudreau (Aug.5) at Progressive Field this season." 

Here's a tidbit from column friend Jimmy Murphy , who tweeted, "The last time the @NHL #NHLAllStar game was in #LA, #Patriots won the Super Bowl!" 

Happy to have spent the last two days in New York City, my hometown, attending a baseball official scorers' meeting. It's an annual event where our group gets together, shares war stories and goes over tricky plays that take place throughout the previous year. 

It's still January, but baseball really is just around the corner. 

Side note: I interrupted the meeting a few times wondering why there were no David Ortiz tributes. I was having withdrawal. 

Work to do 

The Bruins hit the break having apparently calmed the waters around Claude Julien with two wins at home. They visit Tampa Bay Tuesday to start the "second half." 

Asked if this was a perfect time for a break, Tuukka Rask , who needed the rest as much as anyone (nine straight games, 15 of the last 16) but went to the All-Star Game - the weekend right out of hell for the goalies, said: 

"Absolutely. I think somebody mentioned that we have played the most games in the league and it definitely feels that way. We've played every other night, it feels like forever, so I think it's a well- deserved break and we can start it with the right mindset after winning two games so we have to enjoy this break and when we're going to Tampa, just be ready to play because the points are going to be even more important after this." 

The Bruins start play Tuesday as a playoff team, but here's how tenuous things are: 

New Jersey is the only team in the Eastern Conference not at NHL .500 and the Devils fell just under Thursday. Carolina, Buffalo, Detroit and Jersey are all tied for last, seven points behind the Bruins, Carolina and Buffalo with four games apiece in hand, Detroit three and the Devils two. 

. 
The schedule loaded the Bruins down, but when you have to play a lot of games, you better win more of them than you lose. The B's haven't done that, going, 25-21-6 (over NHL .500 but 25-27 in wins and losses). 
Rask was also asked if Thursday marked his first game with new goalie pads. 

He said: "It was! You noticed my tight (butt) there? No issues, I had practiced with them a couple times so they're good, they're comfortable. I don't see any real difference. Good eyes Fluto ( Shinzawa of the Globe)." 

Expansion talk 

If you want to learn everything you can about NHL expansion, dating 50 years back when the league doubled from six to 12 teams, pick up the Hockey News expansion issue. 

Great anecdotes (we always love Seals/Golden Seals stuff) and even Matt Larkin 's mock draft, this one having the Bruins losing young goalie Malcolm Subban to the Vegas Golden Knights. 

Another mock I saw had Colin Miller going. An earlier one had Jimmy Hayes , but he has fallen so far off the radar even an expansion team won't take him. 

In a year of NHL milestones, San Jose GM Doug Wilson on Thursday became the fourth in league history to play 1,000 games and serve a thousand as a general manager, and the first not named Robert. 

The other three? Bob Gainey , Bobby Clarke and Bob Pulford . 

Finally, this has nothing to do with sports, but RIP Mary Tyler Moore . You had an effect on anyone who watched you turn the world on with your smile. Truly one of a kind.
