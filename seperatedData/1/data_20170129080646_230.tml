<TITLE>Taking Stock: Twins go 1-2 in sectional</TITLE>
<TEXT>
Though one Monrovia twin won a championship and the other added a runnerup finish, both Eli and Ethan Stock agreed the biggest match of Saturdays IHSAA sectional tournament at Mooresville came in the semifinal round.

There, Eli Stock, ranked 18th by Indiana Mat coming into the tournament, recorded a 3-1 decision over Franklin Community senior Burk Van Horn. The latter was not only the tournaments top seed at 170 pounds; he also was Indiana Mats top-ranked wrestler at that weight.

That win propelled Eli Stock into the championship match, where he controlled the tempo en route to an 8-2 decision of Center Grove junior Jonah Hays.

I have a huge target on my back now, said Eli Stock, now 31-1 on the season. There are still some things I need to work on. I cant slow down.

Earlier, Ethan Stock pushed the tournaments top-seeded wrestler, Mappes Gleason of Center Grove, to the limit, building a 2-0 lead before Gleason rallied for a 3-2 decision in the final 30 seconds and first place at 160 pounds.

He definitely sparked me up, Ethan Stock said of Eli. Watching my brother beat the No. 1 wrestler in the state was an accomplishment for both of us.

Monrovia coach Kevin Blundell was not surprised.

The biggest match was Eli beating Burk, Blundell said. With the work ethic Eli and Ethan both have, I knew I would see results.

As a result of those results, Eli Stock will take a No. 1 seed into the Feb. 4 IHSAA sectional, again in Mooresvilles Curry Center Gymnasium. Ethan takes a record of 26-4 and a second seed to the regional.

It was a pretty darned good day for the Bulldogs.

Despite hailing from the smallest school in the 10-team tournament, the Bulldogs totaled 126.5 points to place fifth.

Center Grove won it all with 197.5 points, followed by Indian Creek at 153.5, Franklin at 136.5, Plainfield at 134, Monrovia, Greenwood at 105, Martinsville at 95, Mooresville at 77.5 and Decatur Central at 44.

Junior Brycen Denny, 35-6 this year and a state qualifier last season, finished second to unbeaten Indian Creek senior Alex Mosconi when Mosconi managed a 3-0 decision in the championship match.

There appeared to be some controversy when the official awarded Denny a takedown for a 2-1 lead in the second period, but the official then waved off his decision, noting that Denny was unable to maintain his grip.

Also finishing second was Monrovias Mr. Football, senior Camryn Smith. He pinned his way the title tilt at 182 before falling 8-1 to top-seeded Jake Moore of Franklin. Smith takes a 29-4 record to regionals.

Garrison Lee will take a 32-13 record and a second seed at 220 pounds to the regional.

The Monrovia senior, ranked 12th, battled to the championship match, where third-ranked and unbeaten Clayton Scroggs of Martinsville posted a 7-2 decision.

Monrovia wrestled without 285-pound veteran Riley McCubbins, lost to a shoulder injury and subsequent surgery.

The top four finishers in each weight advanced to the regional tournament.

But other wrestlers, including four Bulldogs, made their marks as well.

Freshman Hunter Rutherford, 20-9, took fifth at 113 pounds, winning his final match by injury default.

Junior Austin Clark followed suit, taking fifth at 138 with a spectacular comeback. Clark trailed Plainfield sophomore Gage Jacobs 10-6 with time running out in the third period, but scored a reverse and a near fall to force the match into overtime. There, he took Jacobs to the mat to score a tie-breaking two points and complete his season at 19-15.

We told him to finish his season with a victory, and he came back and got it, noted Blundell.

Freshman Jake Smith, 8-13, finished sixth at 106 pounds.

Sophomore Clay Whitney, 23-11, was sidelined by injury in the fifth-place match at 195.
