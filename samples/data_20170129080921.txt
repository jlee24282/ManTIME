She has won 10 major titles since turning 30 and has made eight out of the last grand slam 10 finals. \n \nWilliams believes she is in the form of her life. \n \n\"I was thinking yesterday on the practice court, 'gosh I'm playing better than I have ever before I think',\" Williams said. \n \n\"I'm moving better, I've always been a fast mover but I stopped moving a bit in the middle of my career because I was like, I don't have to move so much. \n \n\"But I was like, 'man I'm hitting really well'. It feels good to be playing this well at the moment.\" \n \nBy her own high standards, 2016 represented a disappointing season for Williams. \n \nThe American only added a Wimbledon title to her tally and also surrendered the world number one spot to Angelique Kerber after a shock US Open defeat to Karolina Pliskova. \n \n\"Winning this one was very important,\" Williams' coach Patrick Mouratoglou said. \n \n\"I feel when you end the season with a loss, especially in a grand slam, you cannot feel the same way and cannot have a good feeling. \n \n\"She had confidence but not the same kind as when you win. That's why this one was very important for the rest of the season.\" \n \nWilliams has struggled at times with the weight of expectation, crumbling at the 2015 US Open when a calendar grand slam was in sight and then stumbling again there in September when on the brink of breaking Graf's record. \n \nShe has appeared far more relaxed in Melbourne, on and off court, with her new fiance Alexis Ohanian here supporting from her box throughout. \n \n\"I've been trying to live it for some time now, this tournament I was able to do it,\" Williams said. \n \n\"I was okay with not losing but I also knew I didn't have to win here to make my career. It settled with me this time. I don't know why I felt like that but I want to know because I want it again.\" \n \nSurpassing Graf's 22 major triumphs adds statistical weight to the now almost indisputable argument that Williams is the greatest female player of all time. \n \nShe could pass Court's mark at Wimbledon this summer, although 13 of the Australian's 24 successes came before the Open era, when grand slams were still not fully professional. \n \n\"Graf's record is more important because with all the respect for Margaret Court, it's another era,\" Mouratoglou said. \n \n\"The draws were like 16 players, they were not professionals. Of course the record is there and we definitely want to beat it but there is a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf. \n \n\"Serena was not motivated by 22, she was motivated by grand slams. That's her motivation. \n \n\"This won't change until one day she wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams but for now she is, so that's enough. \n \n\"Is that day close? I don't think so. I am not in her head but I don't think so.\" \n \nWilliams did take some motivation from reclaiming her place at the top of the world rankings, which she will when the list refreshes on Monday. \n \nTo avoid adding any extra pressure, however, Mouratoglou told his charge at the start of the tournament that victory would not return her to number one. \n \n\"In the beginning of the tournament, I was like, 'if I win, will I be number one?'\" Williams said. \n \n\"Patrick said, 'no, no, no.' So I was like whatever. Then on the court when they were said, 'and number one', I was like, 'whoa, really'?\" \n \nWilliams later added: \"Kerber played unbelievable, she definitely deserved to have that position. I t didn't hurt or p*** me off, to me it just looked weird. I'd never felt like number two.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena Williams: I'm in the best form of my life after 23rd grand slam","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Durham","zipCode":"DL1","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Darlington","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Chester-le-Street Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"593782450","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Chester-le-Street Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.chesterlestreetadvertiser.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200206263","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Those who applied made numerous applications to different banks.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that it was more difficult for UAE residents to obtain personal finance last year,\u201d the report stated. \n\nJon Richards, CEO at compareit4me.com, said: \u201cThis could be seen as evidence for the argument that banks were somewhat less willing to give out credit during 2016. With the liquidity crunch caused, in part, by low oil prices, banks have had to tighten their belts, and a manifestation of that is that normal consumers see less easy access to personal finance. \n\n\u201cOn the other side of the coin, with uncertainty in the market, it would appear that UAE consumers are being more careful about taking out credit.\n\n\u201cFor 2017, we might expect to see a similar trend. We may see fewer individuals ready to take out personal finance, and those who do want to take out personal loans may find it more difficult to get approvals,\u201d he added. \n\nThe report also found that despite a decline in the overall number of people applying for personal loans in 2016, the number of UAE residents applying for Islamic personal loans increased by 6.85 per cent from 2015 to 2016. \n\nWith an application growth rate of 17.03 per cent over the course of the year, those looking for Islamic personal finance were also forced to apply for multiple products, the report said. \n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t surprising, to be honest. Islamic banks are facing the same challenges that non-Islamic banks are. With low oil prices permeating almost every aspect of business in the GCC, banks of all kinds are taking a more cautious approach to lending,\u201d said Samer Chehab, COO, compareit4me.com. \n\n\u201cWhat this means for consumers is that you may have to apply for several personal loans before seeing an approval.\u201d\n\nIn terms of the most popular personal loans of 2016, Emirates NBD\u2019s Salary Transfer Personal Loan for Expatriates topped the list, followed by Dubai Islamic Bank\u2019s Salam Finance product, ADCB\u2019s Simplylife Salary Transfer Loan, Commercial Bank International\u2019s Personal Loan and ADIB\u2019s Personal Finance for Expats .

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 33 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Forsyth","zipCode":"27116","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Winston Salem","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WXII 12","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688608","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"92"},"name":"WXII 12","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wxii12.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200206611","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Howard Zehr, a restorative justice scholar, describes it as a way to handle conflict and wrongdoing by engaging everyone involved, allowing them to address the full range of harms that occurred and work together to develop a plan for accountability and healing. \n \nOften mistakenly seen as a lenient approach, restorative justice is less accepted in the United States as it is in other nations. In this country, justice focuses on retribution. Getting tough on crime is punishment focused. Approaches to crime that are not heavy-handed and authoritarian are dismissed as ineffective and lenient. \n \nThis perceived lenience, however, is the greatest misconception about restorative justice. Peaceful reactions, strengthening relationships, developing a sense of responsibility and righting wrongs are not accomplished easily. \n \nIn restorative justice, offenders work to accomplish accountability and repairing harms. If they do not, traditional punishments remain available. In many ways, restorative justice can be more effective than traditional punishment-focused sanctions.  Restorative justice has been found to reduce the rate of re-offending. It also can cost less than the court system and incarceration. \n \nRestorative justice differs significantly from our current system of retributive justice. Even so, it is not the opposite of retribution. Both forms of justice are designed to vindicate the crime victim and protect public safety. Restorative justice, however, accomplishes this in a more constructive way. Our justice system, as it operates now, sees crime as a violation against the state, not the victim. Restorative justice is a process that makes the victim central and the consequences specific to the offense. \n \nOur traditional justice system uses pain and punishment to vindicate. Restorative justice vindicates by having the offender take responsibility and repair the damage done. This provides the offender important lessons and the victim a restored a sense of influence and control that being a crime victim often takes away. \n \nConsider the following case. Eight teenagers vandalized a historic cemetery in Longmont, Colorado, in 2013. They desecrated revered objects and damaged 150 markers. Restoring the markers was costly. Families affected were angry and felt emotionally betrayed. The community was shocked. \n \nEveryone, including law enforcement, families of those buried in the cemetery, the district attorney, the community and the families of the teens who committed these acts felt strongly that these youth must be held accountable. \n \nThe Longmont community asked itself a question: How should this accountability be accomplished? What would be true accountability for the crimes committed and the harm done? \n \nTypically, youth charged with vandalism appear in court. They may receive fines, detention or probation. Such consequences provide punishment, but may not address victims\u2019 needs or teach the larger lessons we hope offenders will learn about the ways their actions were truly wrong and harmed people and the community. They may not develop a strong motivation to refrain from such criminal behavior in the future. \n \nInstead of this typical approach to vandalism, the Longmont Community Justice Partnership arranged a conference between the victims, representatives of the community, law enforcement and offenders. Participants explored what happened honestly, what harms occurred (not just what laws were broken) and what should happen to repair those harms from each person\u2019s perspective. \n \nThey determined that the youth should write letters to victims, accept responsibility, offer apology, perform community service over three years and be monitored by restorative justice staff. Outsiders might believe the cemetery would be the logical place of service, but families did not want the youth to return to the cemetery they had desecrated. \n \nFamilies wanted the youth to perform different kinds of physical service for the city, which they did by performing repairs after a flood damaged the community. \n \nSuch respect for victim preferences helps them recover from the harm experienced. All the youth who went through the restorative process fulfilled their commitments. More importantly, they faced those they harmed and learned the true impact of violating the law. The victims were surprised at well how justice was served. \n \nRestorative justice is not intended to completely replace the way cases are currently handled. It offers an option to address certain situations where it can be more effective and accomplish more than punishment would. \n \nThe benefits of restorative practices in our community can be seen through the programs of Neighborhood Reconciliation Services Inc., a local nonprofit dedicated to promoting restorative practices. Applying restorative practices broadly could help our community in many ways. \n \nRestorative practice programs are available to address not only crimes but also a variety of problems, including family conflict, truancy, school discipline, and community conflict. It is an approach our schools, universities, churches, and community groups could benefit from adopting. \n \nRamsey McGowen of Johnson City is employed at East Tennessee State University and Jennifer Mongold is an assistant professor at King University in Bristol. Both serve on the Board of Directors of Neighborhood Reconciliation Services Inc., a local nonprofit dedicated to promoting restorative practices.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"What do we mean by justice?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"37605","state":"Tennessee","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Johnson City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Johnson City Press","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169732646","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"612"},"name":"Johnson City Press","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.johnsoncitypress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200207702","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 32 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Polk","zipCode":"50309","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Des Moines","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KCCI","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659157","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1116"},"name":"KCCI","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kcci.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200209055","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Alabama improved to 13-7 overall, 6-2 in SEC play. The victory gave the Tide a season sweep of the Bulldogs, who fell to 13-7, 4-4 in the league. \n   \nKey, who scored 19 points, has now led Alabama in scoring in its past three games and continues to display the confidence of a much older player. Just before the made 3-pointer, he missed a jumper, but Jimmie Taylor got the offensive rebound and sent it out front to Dazon Ingram. \n   \n\u201cI just saw an opening in the corner so I just decided to sprint there,\u201d Key said. \u201cI was wide open, took a dribble and just shot it. We work on that every day in practice.\u201d \n   \nCrimson Tide coach Avery Johnson obviously was pleased that shot blunted Mississippi State\u2019s charge that took the Bulldogs from 52-41 down to 58-57 ahead. \n   \nHe was just as pleased the freshman looked to take the shot, especially after missing earlier in the possession. \n   \n\u201cBraxton had the confidence to take and make a big shot,\u201d Johnson beamed. \u201cHe\u2019s a different player than he was early in the year. Since he\u2019s been starting at the two position the last two games, he\u2019s settled in. \n   \n\u201cHe\u2019s able to use his size against some of the smaller players. He passes the ball. Had a couple careless turnovers early in the game, but he\u2019s a player we want to continue to encourage because we need him to be productive on both ends of the floor.\u201d \n   \nThis wasn\u2019t a typical Alabama basketball victory. The Crimson Tide shot an impressive 31-for-36 from the free-throw line \u2013 easily its best performance of the season. Ingram, whose struggles at the line even drew some light-hearted shade from Key, was a perfect 12-for-12 at the charity stripe. \n   \n\u201cCoach Avery told me to step up the line with confidence and know that I\u2019m going to hit the free throw,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cWe practice it a lot.\u201d \n   \n\u201cLike Riley (Norris) said a couple weeks ago, as you see your teammates in a game making free throws, it\u2019s contagious. Dazon shot really well tonight and got us all going,\u201d Key said, a sly smile spreading across his face. \u201cHe was shooting pretty bad from the free-throw line. If he can make a free throw, we all can make a free throw.\u201d \n   \nAlabama players made a lot of them. \n   \n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to build confidence,\u201d Johnson said. \u201c\u2026 We totally changed Dazon\u2019s (pre-shot) routine. He\u2019s using his legs more, he\u2019s much more confident. \n   \n\u201cI\u2019m just as proud of Donta (Hall, 4-for-4) and Corban (Collins, 2-for-2), guys that have struggled from the line. Hopefully, this will build some confidence. This lets us know what we\u2019re capable of.\u201d \n   \nAlabama was outshot from the field by Mississippi State (23-for-56 to 17-for-52), and even outrebounded by the Bulldogs 40-37. The difference at the foul line, where State was 11-for-19, was huge. \n   \nSo was the turnover count in the second half. Alabama turned it over just four times to State\u2019s 13 after halftime. \n   \nIngram was only 1-for-9 from the field but finished with 15 points. Norris added 13 points, 10 in the first half. Bola Olaniyan grabbed 11 rebounds and Key had nine boards for Alabama. \n   \nNorris heated up late in the first half, helping Alabama go on a 10-2 run over the last 2:51 for a 34-29 halftime lead. \n   \nThe Crimson Tide opened it up to 41-29 in the first three minutes of the second half. \n   \nJohnson winced as he described Alabama being too loose with the ball during a sequence when his team had a big lead. \n   \n\u201cWe\u2019re up 10 or 12 and get a 2-on-1 break \u2013 and then we go into our Harlem Globetrotters routine,\u201d Johnson said. \n   \nAlabama opened the door and State charged back. Consecutive 3-pointers by Lamar Peters, who led the Bulldogs with 13 points, and Quindarry Weatherspoon, who finished with 11, put them ahead 58-57. \n   \nMississippi State\u2019s Schnider Herard finished with 12 points. \n   \n\u201cI thought we did a great job defending them on their first shot, but they got to the line too much,\u201d MSU coach Ben Howland said. \u201cWe had too many turnovers.

Meanwhile Porsche vs Ford is being set up in GTLM due to the continuous rain. \n \nA trouble-free few hours allowed Max Angelelli to break away, though had now made one more stop than the #10\u2019s nearest rival on track. \n \nThe hour started with a carbon copy of the Brendon Hartley incident. The #85 left the pits on cold tyres and fell backwards, often struggling to take the corners. The JDC-Miller Motorsport car took two laps to get up to speed as it dropped into the GTLM field. \n \nThe rest of the Prototype class saw the #90 VisitFlorida Racing move into true contention for the win as they unlapped themselves for the first time. The final podium place was filled by the recovering #5 Mustang Sampling Racing. After falling to four laps down, the team was now just two behind the leader, setting up a three car fight for the win. \n \nThe PC leader remains the #38 Performance Tech Motorsports as it has been for the majority of the race. They now lead by only four laps to the #20 BAR1 Motorsports car. \n \nFord Chip Ganassi were able to go longer than many of their rivals in GTLM , yet despite this they remained slower than their rivals. Kevin Estre overtook Tony Kanaan in the #69 for the lead on lap 325, yet pitted one rotation later, continuing the race long battle. \n \nSadly, not all the Ford\u2019s had such infallibility, with the #67 driven by Ryan Briscoe hitting the bus stop chicane sharply and breaking off the rear wing on the speedway wall. \n \nThe rain intensified as the clock counted down, setting up the Porsche\u2019s for a strong stint. The #911 retook the lead with Patrick Pilet holding off team-mate Estre until lap 341 when Estre drove away in order to hold counter the Ford\u2019s change of strategy. \n \nElsewhere, a drive through for the #3 Corvette Racing car finally put them out of realistic contention, after they missed the bus stop chicane too many times. \n \nThe GTD battle still had six cars from four manufacturers on the lead lap, with two further manufacturers just a lap behind. Jeff Segal in the #86 Acura continued to be the manufacturer to beat because of a mammoth stint from the leading American. \n \nBehind them, the #29 Montaplastby Land-Motorsport held off the #33 Riley Motorsports towards the end of the hour.

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n \n___ \n \nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n \nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \n \n___ \n \nFAIRFAX, VIRGINIA \n \nDozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. \n \n___ \n \nDENVER \n \nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. \n \n___ \n \nCHICAGO \n \nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n \nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday. \n \nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n \nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n \nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n \nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" \n \n__ \n \nDALLAS \n \nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n \nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition. \n \nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n \nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \n \nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n \n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n \n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n \n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" \n Connect with the Chronicle on Facebook for the latest news, links and more.   \n___ \n \nSEATTLE \n \nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. \n \n___ \n \nPORTLAND, OREGON \n \nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\" \n \n___ \n \nLOS ANGELES \n \nAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil. \n \nAvriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis. \n \n___ \n \nSAN FRANCISCO \n \nHundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport's international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. \n \n___ \n \nSAN DIEGO \n \nAs motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\" \n   \nSuccess!

That's something you've got to get through, the first 10-15 overs are crucial. With the line-up that we play, if we can have wickets in the shed at the back end then we will score a lot of runs at the end of the (innings).\" \n \nThe keeper found out the perils of taking on Eden Park's small boundaries when he played at the ground for the first time last February, caught at cow corner trying to heave Corey Anderson over the ropes. \n \nThe Australians were all out for 148 on that occasion, with the Black Caps' seamers running riot on the way to a 2-1 series win. It was a similar story a year earlier, with the Aussies skittled for 151 in a World Cup clash that the Kiwis only won by a wicket. \n \nAt the same time, Eden Park's unusual dimensions have resulted in big scores before. Although the tourists failed to pass 150 last time around, New Zealand posted a score of 8-307 in the same game. \n \nIndeed, before Australia's innings that day, seven of the last eight innings at the ground had gone past 280 runs. \n \n\"(The Eden Park pitch) just has a bit in it,\" New Zealand veteran Ross Taylor said. \"I don't think there is a par score, some wickets here are 300, some are 200. \n \n\"You just have to analyse it as quickly as possible, whether you're batting or bowling.\" \n \nThe Kiwis were trounced 3-0 in Australia when the sides met in December, but Wade is expecting a tougher time on New Zealand's turf. \n \n\"We played them in Australia (on) big grounds (with) long boundaries. It's a completely different ball game,\" he said. \n \n\"(On) the smaller grounds (in New Zealand) they'll still play aggressive; they're still going to be able to hit plenty of fours and sixes at grounds that they play at. \n \n\"They play well here (in NZ) and they play this venue very well. \n \n\"We like to think we're hard to beat in Australia and it's the same when we come here - we expect a hard challenge over the next three games but we've got a young squad and we're excited to go out and really have a crack at it.\" \n \nCaptaining the side for the first time, Wade maintains his job is simply to continue the fine work of the leadership duo of Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner. \n \n\"I don't think for me personally it's about putting a stamp on the team,\" he said. \"It's about driving the values and the game plan that we have in one-day cricket moving forward. \n \n\"Steven and David have put their stamp on the team, it's just about me keeping on driving those key messages through to the players. \n \n\"We've performed really well in one-day cricket over a long period of time so it's not about trying to change too much - it's about keeping the ball rolling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Aussies wary of Black Caps on home turf","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2478","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Ballina","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Ballina Shire Advocate","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"531939585","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"Ballina Shire Advocate","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ballinaadvocate.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200221784","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T13:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557687z1_20170129162619_000g9dg4eu82-0-5o7dbx25uooe6wninn2_t325x200.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The loss is the third straight for the Wildcats and their 10th overall in conference play. LC is still mathematically alive for the final tournament spot out of the East, but will need some help over the next two and a half weeks to get into the bracket. \n \nA sluggish first few minutes of the game for the Wildcats carried over through the rest of the afternoon, leading LC to their lowest shooting percentage of the season, going 24-of-71 from the floor in the game for 33.8%. The Wildcats started the game 3-for-9 from the floor in the first five minutes of play but were only down 7-6 at that point. \n \nThe Wildcats hung around over the next 10 minutes of play and eventually tied the game thanks to a 3-pointer from Jacquez Coleman, knotting the game at 23 with just under seven minutes remaining in the half. That was the point, however, when LeTourneau would seize control of the game, outscoring LC 16-1 over the final seven minutes of the half. LC went a miserable 0-for-12 from the floor during that stretch, that included several point-blank attempts at the basket, finishing with an 11-for-38 (28.9%) performance for the first 20 minutes. \n \nLC continued to play hard in the second half but the 39-24, halftime deficit was too much for them to overcome in the game. Both teams were even on the offensive side in the second half in terms of rebounds, turnovers, assists, and points, a 49-44 advantage for LeTourneau in the half. LC missed six more shots than the Yellowjackets did in the second half and were outshot 55.9% to 39.4% in the half. \n \nEven with the shooting troubles of the game, Raheem Reigs led the way for the Wildcats once again with his sixth double-double of the season, and his third in the last four games, scoring 20 points and pulling in 10 rebounds. After missing Thursday's game due to concussion symptoms, Taylan Grogan bounced back with an 18-point outing with five rebounds, the only other Wildcat to reach double figures in the game. He converted on 4-of-6 shots from behind the arc in the second half and made 5-of-7 overall. \n \nThe Wildcats return to H.O. West Fieldhouse on Thursday for a rematch with the LeTourneau Yellowjackets in the first of a five-game home stand. LC will tip-off Thursday night at 7:30pm and then host UT Tyler on Saturday afternoon at 3pm.

NSU (8-10 overall, 3-5 in the Southland) carved a 21-point deficit shortly after halftime down to 53-46, but the Cardinals (13-9, 5-4) responded by scoring the next nine points beginning a decisive 16-2 run. \n \nLamar posted a dominating 39-21 rebounding advantage over an NSU squad that had out-rebounded Southeastern Louisiana by 16 on Wednesday night. The Cardinals outscored the Demons 30-14 in points off turnovers, although Lamar had 19 miscues to 18 for NSU. \n \n\u201cThey were focused and did what they had to do,\u201d said Demons\u2019 coach Mike McConathy. \u201cThey\u2019d lost three of their last four and played with the urgency we expected, and we did not come close to matching it. It was obvious, for whatever reason, that we didn\u2019t find that extra push. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve been living off in the last two games,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the extra energy to win the 50-50 balls and it seemed like Lamar got nearly every one. We didn\u2019t lay down by any means, but we weren\u2019t very effective except in a couple of spurts. \n \n\u201cWe played so hard the last two games, and we were trying really hard today, but couldn\u2019t find our backsides with our own two hands,\u201d said McConathy. \n \nNSU sank only 32 percent of its first-half shots, falling behind 42-25. The Demons dumped in 52 percent afterward, including 6 of 9 on 3-pointers, but threatened only briefly. A 19-5 run over 4:36 brought the visitors within seven points before Lamar regained control. \n \nThe Cardinals got 18 points apiece from Southland Player of the Week Colton Weisbrod and Nick Garth, who hit 5 of 7 on 3-pointers after halftime, and Josh Nzeakor scored 17 inside. \n \nThe Demons were led by Sabri Thompson\u2019s 16 points and three steals. Devonte Hall scored 13 while issuing seven assists and making three steals. Iziahiah Sweeney also scored 13. \n \nNSU will wrap up its string of four consecutive road games next Thursday night at Central Arkansas.

Lamar forced 10 fourth-quarter turnovers, erasing a three-point deficit and handing Northwestern State its third straight loss, 73-60, at the Montagne Center. \n \n\u201cWe played 30 minutes like we needed to,\u201d first-year head coach Jordan Dupuy said. \u201cUnfortunately, we didn\u2019t play the last 10 that way. We had way too many turnovers. They rattled us. They stayed in their run-and-jump pressure in the second half in the half-court and didn\u2019t allow us to run our sets.\u201d \n \nLamar (15-5, 7-2) came into the game leading the nation in turnovers forced per game (25.44), but the Lady Demons handled the Cardinals\u2019 defensive pressure well for much of the game. \n \nIn the first 30 minutes, Northwestern State (9-11, 3-6 Southland Conference) committed just 11 turnovers while handing out 15 assists, building a three-point lead after three quarters. \n \nThe Lady Demons were the defensive aggressors for much of the game, forcing the Cardinals into 16 turnovers and turning them into 20 points. After Lamar took an 30-22 lead with 7:24 to play in the first half, Northwestern State showed its ability to play defense. \n \nThe Lady Demons held Lamar scoreless for 6:11 as Beatrice Attura took over offensively. \n \nAttura put together a personal 11-0 run and Cheyenne Brown\u2019s bucket made it a 13-0 NSU run that extended the Lady Demons\u2019 lead to 35-30 before Lamar scored the final four points of the half. \n \nAttura finished the first half with 17 points and nine assists but did not attempt a field goal in the second half. Brown, meanwhile, tallied her second straight double-double, scoring 15 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. \n \n\u201cThey started running people left and right at her,\u201d Dupuy said of Attura, who moved into 24th on NSU\u2019s all-time scoring list with 1,204 points. \u201cThey took the ball out of her hands.\u201d \n \nThe Cardinals started the fourth quarter with a 7-0 run before Shahd Abboud (17 points) hit a free throw to break the drought. However, Lamar continued to pressure the Lady Demons effectively. \n \nAfter scoring just six points off turnovers in the first three quarters, Lamar turned NSU\u2019s 10 fourth-quarter turnovers into 15 points. \n \n\u201cIn my view, there are no such things as moral victories,\u201d Dupuy said. \u201cThere are a lot of positives to build off of. We had a great three quarters from our team. We were making the extra pass, sharing the basketball on offense. We have to bottle that up and do it for four quarters.\u201d \n \nMo Kinard led Lamar with 20 points while Kiara Desamours added 18, Kiandra Bowers chipped in 16 and Chastadie Barrs 11 for the Cardinals. \n \nNorthwestern State will take its final week-long break of the season, returning to action Feb. 4 against Stephen F.

(LSUA) - The Generals imposed their will on the inside to pull away late from University of the Southwest as LSUA scored its highest total on the season to end a two-game losing streak with a 92-72 win over the Mustangs Saturday afternoon at The Fort. \n \nMuch like the first game between the two teams this season, it was the Mustangs who jumped out to a quick lead as Southwest made the first two buckets to get a 4-0 advantage just more than two minutes into the game. But LSUA responded by scoring seven of the next nine points as Katie Lemieux\u2019s three-point play put the Generals on top 7-6 with 6:00 left in the opening quarter. \n \nLSUA\u2019s largest lead of the period was four points, done three times, the last on Lemieux\u2019s elbow jumper that put the Generals up 20-16. Southwest finished the quarter on a 5-0 run, and An\u2019Jolique Woodson\u2019s lay-up right before the horn put the Mustangs up 21-20 after one. \n \nWith the game tied at 30-30 just more than 3:30 into the second quarter, Kayla Morgan\u2019s three gave the Generals the lead for good, and sent the Generals on a period-ending 17-8 run that another Morgan three ended with seconds left in the period to put LSUA up 47-38 at halftime. \n \nSouthwest started the second half on a 9-4 push that pulled the LSUA lead down to just four points as Stephanee Carrillo\u2019s basket made the score 51-47 Generals just less than three minutes into the third period. But LSUA answered again, this time with a seven straight points as Kayla Morgan\u2019s free throw with just about 5:30 left in the quarter gave the Generals their first double-digit lead of the game at 58-47. \n \nThe Generals would get the lead to a dozen three times in the third quarter, the final time on Nicole Bouillion\u2019s made three-pointer that put the Generals up 70-58 with less than a minute left in the stanza. LSUA\u2019s lead would not fall under double-digits the rest of the afternoon as the Generals led 70-60 at the buzzer. \n \nLSUA methodically built on the lead during the fourth quarter. Kayla Morgan set the Generals on a decisive run as her jumper in the lane set off an 8-0 LSUA run midway through the period which Lillie Snowden\u2019s free throws finished with 4:35 left in the game to give LSUA an 84-65 advantage. Temekia Bonner\u2019s basket with just seconds left provided the Generals with both their largest lead of the game and the game\u2019s final score, 92-72. \n \n\u201cWe played well as a team today,\u201d said LSUA head coach Bob Austin. \u201cWe moved the ball well and got it into the hands of players who had open looks, and we did a good job of converting those shots. We were also extremely active on the defensive end, which got us a lot of steals and easy looks and helped jump start our offense after a slow start and got us rolling. And I can\u2019t say enough about Kayla, whose been shooting very well as of late and finished tonight with yet another 30 point game.\u201d \n \nKayla Morgan led all players with 30 points on ten of 19 shooting in the contest, five of her makes coming from above the three-point arc. This was Morgan\u2019s second straight game with 30 or more points and third time this season hitting the 30-point mark. Temekia Bonner had her second straight game with double-figure points with 15. Katie Lemieux added in 13 while Luv Blackburn rounded out the LSUA leading scorers with ten points. \n \nThe Generals (6-8, 4-6 RRAC) shot 47.8% from the field in the contest, including 36.8% from long distance. While rebounding was even, 39-38 in favor of Southwest, the Generals got inside to score, dominating points in the paint 46-28. LSUA also dominated fast break points, 17-2, points off turnovers, 26-6, and points off the bench, 32-17. On the defensive side, Southwest (1-20, 1-10 RRAC) shot 45.5% from the field and 36.8% from deep, but turned the ball over 25 times, 18 due to LSUA steals. \n \nLSUA returns to action Wednesday evening up I-49 as the Generals take on LSU Shreveport.

With the win the Wildcats improve to 5-6 in conference play, just one game behind the Yellowjackets in the loss column, and facing LeTourneau again in their next game on Thursday in Pineville. \n \nThings started off quickly in the game as LeTourneau's Crystal Jones and LC's Kourtney McGhee traded 3-pointers to start the game. The Wildcats took the lead after that on back-to-back buckets from Kristen Breaux. The teams traded baskets through much of the quarter, neither team taking control of the game, leading to a 16-16 tie at the end of the first. Neither team scored in the final 2:22 of the first quarter, the last basket, a layup from RyDeja McQuarn, the second of her six made field goals of the game. \n \nThe slow ending to the first quarter was quickly erased as the teams came out hot in the second quarter, combining for 50 points total, and the Wildcats would hold a 42-40 lead at the break. The scoring outburst was thanks in large part to excellent shooting from behind the arc. The Wildcats went 3-of-5 from distance and the Yellowjackets made 4-of-6 attempts from downtown in the third quarter alone. \n \nThe slim halftime lead for the Wildcats quickly turned into a comfortable advantage as LC converted on their first four field goal attempts to start the second half, taking a 51-42 lead less than two minutes into the third quarter. LC continued to stretch their lead the rest of the quarter, outscoring LeTourneau 18-10 over the final 5:29 of the period, taking a 72-57 lead into the fourth. \n \nLC maintained their lead through the fourth quarter, thanks to good enough free throw shooting, making 10-of-18 from the line in the final quarter to help seal the victory. The Wildcats shot their second-best field goal percentage of the season in the game at 43.4% for the afternoon, it was also the team's best 3-point shooting game of the season, going 7-of-13 from distance for 53.8%. \n \nHead Coach Patrece Carter said after the game, \"Letourneau is a scoring machine, and it took 40 minutes of defensive pressure and us hitting big shots to get this win! Tonight, I finally saw the entire roster play as a team for 40 minutes with no breaks, and that is what we have to have every game from here on out to stay in playoff contention.\" \n \nThe Wildcats saw five players go for double figures in the game, led by sophomore RyDeja McQuarn and her season-high 19 points. Brooke Jones came just a rebound shy of a double-double for the second time in three games with 17 points and nine rebounds. Karlee Teddlie had 14 points on 5-of-9 shooting, Rachel Johnson put together another solid outing with 13 points, and Kourtney McGhee finished with 10 points and seven rebounds. \n \nWith five ASC games remaining on the schedule, the Wildcats still sit in the fourth and final tournament spot out of the Eastern Division. LC returns to H.O. West Fieldhouse this week for the start of a five-game home stand.

Smith also capped the run with another three as Chris Vickers gave it to him for the shot that made the score 13-0 with just about 15:45 left in the period.

We were very balanced scoring wise and I thought we shared the ball well, leading to a lot of assists. We were a bit loose with the ball at times though, which led to some turnovers. We need to protect the ball better. But overall, we played well, and got to reward some younger players for their hard work with some quality playing time tonight, and I thought they did very well while out on the court. Now our guys get to enjoy a day off before we start preparing for a tough road game at our rival in Shreveport.\u201d \n \nFive Generals scored in double digits, led by Jordin Williams and Brian Sylvester, who each out in 14 points.

The city's economic development department and the Cumberland County Improvement Authority are forwarding to the Minnesota-based company the names of companies that have expressed interest in the site. \"We are all very confident that as we continue down the process of working with Progresso ... that we can work with some other entity to backfill the property and create jobs,\" said CCIA Executive Director Gerard Velasquez. However, Velasquez said, \"nothing has been committed to.\" City Economic Development Director Sandy Forosisky said General Mills is \"kicking the tires with some different companies.\" The most likely fit for the property would be another food-processing company, she said. Forosisky said it's unlikely the city can provide big enough economic lures for large companies to take over the plant. \"We're talking substantial money,\" she said. \"Our little Urban Enterprise Zone loans aren't going to make a difference.\" Some substantial funds to attract a company to the site could come from the state Economic Development Authority, Forosisky said. Any tenant considering locating at the Progresso site could, based on eligibility, apply for EDA financing that includes loans, bonds or Grow New Jersey tax credits, said Virginia Pellerin, the authority's program manager. The EDA is also part of the Partnership for Action, which has a \"business action center\" that serves as a one-stop ship for companies, she said. \"The staff of the business action center is aware of the availability of the Progresso site, and is knowledgeable about its features,\" she said. \"The merits of the site are presented to any client for which the property may be suitable.\" General Mills announced the closing in July, saying it planned to \"transfer production to other U.S. facilities to eliminate excess soup capacity in ... North America.\" The company confirmed the closing in September. General Mills on Monday filed a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice, commonly referred to as a WARN notice, with the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development. The WARN filing is required by the federal government so workers can get 60-day layoff notices connected to mass layoffs or factory closings. The WARN notice indicated General Mills will lay off 338 workers. The first 65 employees are scheduled to lose their jobs March 24, according to the notice and General Mills. Velasquez said the CCIA will provide job training for the Progresso workers who lose their jobs. The plant has been a mainstay of Cumberland County's economy since the 1940s. It was bought by General Mills in 2001 and was featured in a series of national advertisements touting Vineland as the home of Progresso soup. This year is Progresso's 75th anniversary. \"It's a big blow,\" Velasquez said of the plant's closing.

Cricket Australia on Sunday said the enormous crowds and viewership for the fast-paced format this season had surpassed expectations. The Big Bash is in its sixth season and has used a blend of sport and entertainment to draw families and younger spectators to games.\n\nPyrotechnics on and off the field has seen more than one million people attend this season's matches with an average attendance of 30,114 per match, according to the CA.\n\n\"Once again, fans have well and truly spoken and we couldn't be happier with how this year's competition has progressed on all levels,\" Big Bash chief Anthony Everard said in a statement.\n\n\"The season has well and truly exceeded our expectations\".\n\nThe league concluded on Saturday, with a sold-out crowd at the WACA Ground in Perth.

Now it\u2019s at the forefront of the currency bloc\u2019s reflation, with price increases potentially exceeding 2 percent, and dissatisfaction with the European Central Bank has morphed into outrage. \n \nCritics and media are slamming the institution\u2019s monetary stance -- set to support not just Germany but the entire 19-nation region -- as mainstream parties struggle to contain a surge in populism ahead of national elections. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has warned that higher inflation could cause \u201cpolitical problems,\u201d and German monetary officials are urging their peers to start devising an exit strategy from unconventional stimulus. \n \nMore from Bloomberg.com: Trump\u2019s Order on Refugee Limits Draws Iran Retaliation Threat \n \n\u201cECB-bashing in Germany will certainly speed up on Monday,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING-DiBa AG in Frankfurt. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely overblown discussion -- as long as you have core inflation of around 1 percent in Germany, there really isn\u2019t any reason to worry.\u201d \n \nGerman inflation saw the largest jump on record when it accelerated to 1.7 percent in December, as euro-area price growth almost doubled to 1.1 percent. The country\u2019s states will start to release January data at 9 a.m. Monday, with national figures due at 2 p.m. \n \nMore from Bloomberg.com: White House Defends Immigrant Ban After Travelers Stopped \n \nAnother strong reading -- economists predict 2 percent -- would fan a debate questioning the ECB\u2019s policy stance that was fired up after the country\u2019s most-read newspaper Bild responded to last month\u2019s increase with a call to \u201cRaise rates now!\u201d \n German Angst  \nProminent German economists and politicians are blunt in their warnings that monetary stimulus is going too far, even with inflation primarily driven by energy costs that the ECB can\u2019t control. Germany\u2019s central bankers are nudging their colleagues toward a discussion about how to normalize policy in more subtle tones. \n \nMore from Bloomberg.com: Trump Warms to House Republicans\u2019 Proposed Border-Adjusted Tax \n \nECB Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger argued that \u201call preconditions for a stable rise in inflation exist\u201d and the question of an exit can \u201csoon\u201d be addressed. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann repeatedly warns of risks related to asset purchases and an overly accommodative stance. \n \nEven though Germany\u2019s aversion to inflation -- rooted in the 1920s, when workers used wheelbarrows to collect their daily pay -- is met with sympathy abroad, the intensity of the discussion has some people spooked. \n \nSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy expressed concern last week over a premature tightening, given that his nation still has about a fifth of its workforce standing idle. \n \nA slew of data this week will provide an update on growth, inflation and confidence in the euro-area economy. \n   Period  Survey  Prior  Mon: Economic Confidence  Jan  107.8  107.8  Tue: GDP (qoq)  4Q  0.4%  0.3%  Tue: Inflation  Jan  1.5%  1.1%  Tue: Unemployment  Dec  9.8%  9.8%   \nAny improvements in the region\u2019s data will also be a reflection of Germany\u2019s economic dominance . The country has driven the recovery since the 2008 financial meltdown and mitigated the double-dip recession in 2012 and 2013 following the debt crisis. But with faster growth comes faster inflation.  \n Mathematical Equation  \n\u201cYou have periphery states with very low inflation because capacity isn\u2019t fully utilized there, and Germany, where a higher capacity utilization results in a stronger upward trend of prices,\u201d said Stefan Kipar, an economist at Bayerische Landesbank in Munich. \u201cIt\u2019s a mathematical equation -- even when the ECB reaches its goal of inflation just below 2 percent on average, some countries will have lower rates while others will overshoot.\u201d \n \nECB President Mario Draghi has tried to assuage German concerns, arguing the continued support of the euro-area economy with low interest rates and asset purchases is in the country\u2019s interest, and inflation is far from spiraling out of control.  \n \nHis argument is that underlying price pressures are still weak. German companies are only partially passing on higher costs to clients, and consumers haven\u2019t noticed a significant pickup in inflation. Wage growth has remained subdued despite above-potential growth over the past three years and a decline in unemployment to a record low. \n \n\u201cWages in Germany have been growing moderately in past years, but that hasn\u2019t led to any significant upward pressure on German core inflation, and I don\u2019t really see that changing this year,\u201d said Andreas Rees, an economist at UniCredit Bank AG in Frankfurt. \u201cI don\u2019t really see any big inflation risks.\u201d \n \nMore from Bloomberg.com \n \nRead on bloombergpolitics.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Germany news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"German Pride Shifting to Frustration in Role as Motor of Europe","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Yahoo!

No amount of history can gloss over that fact.\n\nIf you find that notion intriguing, puzzling or even infuriating \u2014 \u201cThe Other Einstein,\u201d by Pittsburgh-based writer Marie Benedict, is worth a read.\n\nLetters between Albert Einstein and Mileva Maric \u2014 his first wife and the novel\u2019s protagonist \u2014 have served as a window into Einstein\u2019s heart. However, one letter is notorious for painting a very unromantic picture of the celebrated physicist.\n\nIt is, in short, a list of terms and conditions Einstein claims Maric must abide by. If she does not, he will leave her. The letter includes housekeeping demands, instructions that she refrain from speaking to him except during public outings and commands for obedience. It begs the question, how could a secular saint like Einstein be so backward and misogynistic?\n\n\u201cThe Other Einstein\u201d attempts to answer this question, and in doing so, highlights the dangers of deifying any man.\n\nUntil very recently, Maric has been little more than a footnote in Einstein\u2019s story, even though she was also a brilliant physicist who studied among Einstein and his peers. \u201cThe Other Einstein\u201d puts Maric at the forefront of the narrative, letting her tell her own story. And, in doing so, the reader begins to get a more complete picture of who she was, and in turn, who Einstein was as well.\n\nThe book offers no surprises to those who are familiar with Einstein\u2019s life. But because it is a work of fiction, it is able to go beyond what we know, filling in the gaps of history.\n\nThe novel opens with Maric, a withdrawn yet witty young woman, traveling to Zurich to attend classes. Her gender, physical ailments and Serbian background make her a target on every level for disdain and prejudice. But, despite all this, it is in Zurich where she starts to come into her own, eventually seeking intellectual and social fulfillment.\n\nAt first it\u2019s an idyllic beginning for young Einstein and Maric. But a shadow looms over even the bright parts of the novel. Whether you\u2019ve read the cruel list of demands Einstein penned, or simply recall the fact that he married his cousin later in life, you know things do not turn out well for Maric.\n\nIn a sad twist of fate, it is her hunger for knowledge that puts her in the path of a man who, in many ways, would hold her back from fulfilling her dreams.\n\n\u201cThe Other Einstein\u201d is rife with harsh revelations about Einstein\u2019s character. He is frequently portrayed as manipulative, narcissistic and abusive. Despite there being some evidence to back up her portrayal, many will argue that the way Ms. Benedict portrays Einstein is unfair and biased. However, casting Maric in such a benevolent way was likely not done without a purpose. Her story arc is reminiscent of many gothic tales and recalls \u201cJane Eyre\u201d especially. They are both pure young women who overcome great obstacles in a pursuit of happiness only, in the end, to be seduced and thwarted by a man who is both malevolent and compelling.\n\nHowever, unlike \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d our heroine\u2019s story does not end in redemption. Readers will find that the book is easily digestible, as Ms. Benedict breezes through even the most traumatic events. This can be frustrating, as Maric\u2019s story is so unique and rich, and has been ignored for so long, that many will want to delve deeper into her motivations, thoughts and sorrows. However, \u201cThe Other Einstein\u201d is a compelling read, and offers up a moral that many can appreciate: brilliance of mind does not equal excellence of character.\n\nMia Bencivenga is a writer and editor based in Pittsburgh.

Its scope is relatively small, focusing as it does on the first 25 years in the life of an erudite man from New Jersey. An epic scale isn\u2019t a requirement for profundity, however. At the heart of this novel is a provocative question: What would have happened if your life had taken a different turn at a critical moment?\n\nWhen you begin \u201c4 3 2 1,\u201d you may think you\u2019ve entered the realm of Philip Roth, with its bookish, baseball- and basketball-loving protagonist growing up in the Weequahic section of Newark. But Mr. Auster has a clever twist in mind. This novel isn\u2019t just one story but four variations on the life of Archibald Isaac Ferguson, born, like Mr. Auster, in 1947.\n\nIn a brief prologue \u2014 given this novel\u2019s ambition, brief is 30 pages long \u2014 we learn the family\u2019s history: Ferguson\u2019s grandfather, \u201ca broad-shouldered roustabout, a Hebrew giant,\u201d arriving at age 19 on Ellis Island from Minsk; Ferguson\u2019s father, Stanley, growing up in New Jersey, getting blinded when his mother, on one of her \u201cbroom-swatting rampages,\u201d hits him in the right eye, and marrying well-to-do Rose Adler, a union that produces their only son.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when the novel splits. In an ingenious move, Mr. Auster imagines four distinct narratives for his hero, a brilliant, if overlong, way of demonstrating that circumstances and luck play as big a role in one\u2019s success as talent and hard work. Mr. Auster gives us more than a 20th-century bildungsroman reminiscent of Fielding\u2019s \u201cTom Jones\u201d; \u201c4 3 2 1\u201d is a bildungsroman times four.\n\nIn one version, he\u2019s the JFK-obsessed budding reporter son of a middle-class family. In another, he\u2019s a cinema-obsessed bisexual who skips college and heads to Paris at the height of the Vietnam War. And in another, his father is the wealthy owner of a chain of furniture-appliance stores, and privileged Ferguson, author of two-dozen short stories and a one-act play by the time he\u2019s 18, is Princeton bound.\n\nYour appreciation of \u201c4 3 2 1\u201d will depend on whether you savor the detail in long passages such as a two-page account of Willie Mays\u2019 famous catch in the 1954 World Series, multipage synopses of Laurel and Hardy films, Ferguson\u2019s 12-page story about brogans named Hank and Frank, and a Balzacian description of Ferguson\u2019s Paris apartment, or feel that the narrative would have benefited from ruthless editing, and whether you think phrases such as \u201cthe agon of competition\u201d show a young sportswriter figuring out the power of words or an author who, for all of his considerable talents, can sometimes seem too proud of his erudition.\n\nFans of Mr. Auster\u2019s straightforward style and frequent references to classical music, Russian and French novels, and classic works of art-house cinema, however, will find much to enjoy.\n\nDespite the variations in each story, it never occurs to Mr. Auster that his hero would consider a career unrelated to letters. Newspaper reporter, movie critic, novelist \u2014 Ferguson\u2019s aspirations never stray far from the world of writing. But maybe that\u2019s Mr. Auster\u2019s point. Ferguson\u2019s world differs from story to story, yet much stays the same: he and his parents like tennis, he\u2019s passionate about literature and sports, and he and his photographer mother \u2014 her career fortunes change throughout the book, too \u2014 love to visit movie theaters together. One\u2019s destiny, Mr. Auster suggests, may be subject to gale-force winds, but, if you have enough luck, savvy and determination, you\u2019ll eventually get where you want to go.\n\nMichael Magras is a member of the National Book Critics Circle.

Bob was born into an Arizona pioneer family on June 29th 1939 in Jerome, AZ .

After his service, he returned home to Arizona State University, graduating in 1965 with a degree in Engineering. While still in college, Bob began working for General Motors at the Desert Proving Ground in Mesa, AZ where he spent his entire 35-year career. Bob was an avid outdoorsman and photographer, who enjoyed camping, hiking, skiing, fishing, and hunting. Most of all, he had a passion for traveling to places off the beaten path. Many will remember Bob as one of the founding members of the Arizona Outdoor and Travel club, where he lead many trips throughout Arizona, the western U.S, Mexico, and Canada. He especially loved Alaska and British Columbia where he visited many times. \n\nBob is survived by his sons Michael of Mesa and Brian of Tempe; grandsons Ryan and Sean of Mesa; sister Marcia Devere of Sierra Vista, AZ, and brother Bill Riordan of Apache Junction, AZ; plus several nieces, nephews, and cousins.

The gesture seemed to work for Kuahine himself, as he was the first wrestler to put SF State on the board against California Baptist with his 6-4 win over Dominic Kincaid in the 165 weight class. \n \nKuahine, who struggled a little in the beginning of the match with an initial takedown from Kincaid, said he wants to work on starting off his matches at a higher tempo, but he was happy with his performance on Friday. \n \n\u201cIt was tough getting back into the groove of things, going to class and going to practice,\u201d Kuahine said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been training all winter, so I felt pretty good.\u201d \n \nThe Gators recently returned from seven games on the road in Indiana and Nebraska, where they suffered losses throughout the National Wrestling Coaches Association National Duals and broke even between wins and losses at the University of Nebraska Kearney Midwest Duals. \n \nJensen admitted exhaustion from travel and the turmoil of the first week of classes might have played a part in his team\u2019s performance on Friday. \n \nThough Matt Gamble attempted to keep the momentum going against California Baptist, pinning Mario Barrios at 2:12 in the 125 weight class, the Gators fell short losing to California Baptist 30-15. \n \nThe second match, against Simon Fraser was riddled with forfeits from the opponents, proving beneficial for the Gators, as they dominated Simon Fraser 39-9. \n  Alina Castillo  \nSF State wrestler pins down an SFU opponent during a match in the gym at SF State in San Francisco, Calif., on January 17, 2017. (Alina Castillo/Xpress) \n  \nAside from the five forfeits, grad student Joshua Weinberg lead the Gators off with his 12-8 win against Simon Fraser\u2019s Taber Spray in the 149 weight class. In a close match, SF State\u2019s Jesse Lyga squeezed out a 3-2 win against Reid Watkins in the 174 weight class. \n \nJohnathon Costa gained the final win against Simon Fraser after losing by technical fall to California Baptist\u2019s number one ranked Jacob Waste at 6:21 in his prior match-up of the day. \n \nAlthough Costa, who moved up a weight class to 197, won his match against Simon Fraser\u2019s Ciaran Ball 6-4, he said he was disappointed in his overall performance on Friday. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t show up today,\u201d Costa said. \u201cI cut weight pretty poorly and I think that effected my performance.\u201d \n \nCosta said he was 2 pounds overweight at weigh-in and could feel it in his body and his performance. \n \n\u201cIt definitely takes a toll when you cut weight wrong, \u201c Costa said. \u201cEveryone saw it out there with my performance.\u201d \n \nCosta\u2019s teammates could be heard yelling at him to stop looking at the clock as he continuously looked over to see how much time remained in the middle of his match. \n \n\u201cThat was just me being lazy to be honest,\u201d Costa said. \u201cI need to push the pace, I can\u2019t be looking at the clock like that.\u201d \n \nOverall, Jensen said his team performed well and he feels he has a strong core group of wrestlers and newer members of the team who will be given more chances to shine. \n \n\u201cWe did fairly well,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cI\u2019m happy with our performance, but we\u2019ve just got to get better.\u201d \n \nJensen said he hopes to have another successful day Saturday when 24 wrestlers on the team have the chance to match up in the SF State hosted 40th Annual California Collegiate Wrestling Open. \n \nThe Gators will match up against some of the top ranked schools in the nation including Stanford University, ranked 20 in Division I.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Laura Monique Ordoñez"},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Gator men\u2019s wrestling breaks even in back-to-back match","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"San Francisco","zipCode":"94132","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"San Francisco","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Golden Gate Xpress","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"202199673","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"95"},"name":"Golden Gate Xpress","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.goldengatexpress.org"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200256233","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:24:17Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://i1.wp.com/goldengatexpress.org/home/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3_12717_Castillo.jpg?resize=800%2C547"}],"video":[]}}

If an importer is found involved in misusing the incentives, the entire duty and taxes would be recovered from him. \n \nThe worth of CPEC, which is termed as the game changer for the economy of Pakistan, has reached $54 billion (Rs5,700 billion), financing rail-based mass transit, special economic zones, energy, infrastructure development and Gwadar-related projects. Initially, Chinese government pledged $46 billion to build a series of infrastructure development projects. \n \nThe FBR issued several notifications to grant exemption from duty and taxes on import of equipment and capital goods to be used in these projects.  \n \nThe official said the strategy was formulated considering the massive misuse of tax incentives specific for consignments under the Afghan transit trade. \n \nThe past of experience of Pakistan Customs, regarding the preferential clearance of consignments under the Afghan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA), was not good. Fake import certificates were used to wrongfully claim the tax incentives. In reality, the goods bound for Afghanistan, under the APTTA, were illegally unloaded on Pakistani soil, incurring huge losses to national exchequer as well as local manufacturing sector. was posted in Business of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 29, 2017 and was last updated on January 29, 2017.

I was housed and fed, it was paradise,\" the 33-year-old osteopath said. \n\nIn 2012 she had moved to Luanda, capital of the former Portuguese colony, rich in oil and diamonds. But after a dream start, euphoria began to give way to disillusion. \n\n\"I started to be paid in kwanzas, the local currency, and my monthly income dropped to 1,000 euros. You can only change money on the black market, at a really bad rate,\" she said, eventually leaving as the cost of living got too high. \n\nHer return in 2015 to Portugal, then barely out of a deep recession, was a brutal experience. On a wage of 650 euros a month for working in a gym, she said that \"it's not enough to have a decent quality of life\". \n\nSome 300,000 Portuguese colonists fled Angola as violence flared in the run-up to independence in 1975. Forty years later, Portugal is witnessing a new wave of \"retornados\" -- returnees -- leaving the African nation as it wrestles with its own economic woes. \n\n- Salary delays - \n\nThe exodus began in 2015 and is still going on, according to Paulo Vieira, president of the Portuguese-Angolan chamber of commerce. \n\nThe end of Angola's bloody 27-year civil war in 2002, combined with high global oil prices, unleashed rapid development, with Luanda often compared to a new Dubai. \n\nGDP growth peaked at over 20 percent in 2007, but the decline in oil prices, poor governance and lack of investment have seen growth collapse to less than two percent last year. \n\nAlthough Angola remains Africa's biggest oil producer alongside Nigeria, revenues have halved. \n\nThe Angolan government, reliant on oil for 70 percent of its budget, has put the brakes on public spending, stopping thousands of building projects and imposed currency restrictions, hitting the construction industry. \n\n\"Several Portuguese companies in Angola can no longer pay their staff because they are having problems repatriating profits,\" said Ricardo Pedro Gomes, president of Portugal's construction industry association. \n\n\"Of the 100,000 Portuguese construction workers in Angola before the economic crisis, there are only a few thousand left. And there are salary delays going back up to a year,\" construction union leader Albano Ribeiro said. \n\nPedro Dias, 42, a salesman for an Angolan electronics company, saw his friends leave, one by one, before returning to Portugal himself as well. \n\nIn Luanda, he was paid up to 3,000 euros a month and the company paid for his accommodation, car and food -- a good income to support his wife and three children back home. \n\nBut with the currency restrictions, bank transfers to Portugal have stopped. \n\n\"I had to leave, my family have to eat,\" he said, his eyes hidden behind dark sunglasses. \n\n- 'Love-hate' - \n\nDias says he still misses Angola. \n\n\"If the situation improves, I'll go back,\" he says, recalling \"the smell of Africa and the savannah\". \n\nExpat life in Luanda is full of pitfalls and politics is off-limits in a country ruled by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos (Dusseldorf: STS1.DU - news ) for some 37 years. \n\n\"You never talk about the Angolan regime in public,\" Dias says. \"If you want to avoid problems you must not get involved in politics.\" \n\nAnd Pereira tells of being attacked in broad daylight \"with a gun pointed at my head by 10 or 11 year-old children\" and almost dying after catching malaria and yellow fever. \n\nDespite these hair-raising experiences, Pereira says she misses her old life, and is already planning to move to another former Portuguese colony, Sao Tome and Principe. \n\n\"It's a love-hate relationship, I have always been fascinated by Africa,\" she says, remembering the \"wonderful beaches\" and \"the smell of damp earth\".","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Angola news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Portugal news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Sun sets on Angolan dream for Portuguese expats","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Yahoo!

He denies the charges. \n \nAhead of May´s visit, Britain´s Trade and Investment Minister Mark Price held a series of meetings with Turkish ministers in Ankara. \n \nBilateral trade between the two countries amounted to more than $16 billion (14.9 billion euros) in 2015, Turkish figures show, with Britain the second most important country for exports and 11th in terms of imports. \n \nThree months after the Brexit vote, foreign minister Boris Johnson made a colourful visit to Turkey during which he said Britain was seeking a \"jumbo free trade deal\" with Ankara. \n \nNoting that trade ties were already significant, Johnson said he was the \"proud\" owner of a Turkish washing machine and acknowledged that Britain´s iconic Jaffa Cake biscuits were owned by a Turkish confectionary giant. \n \nHe also ebulliently brushed off the embarrassment of penning the winning entry in an offensive poetry competition about Erdogan which was published by The Spectator magazine earlier in the year. Back in the UK, MPs have urged May not to let her eagerness to promote trade overshadow human rights concerns over Turkey´s post-coup crackdown. \n \n\"The Conservative Brexit government is so desperate for trade deals with anyone but the mature democracies of the European Union that even the most unsavoury rulers are to be subjected to the prime ministerial charm,\" opposition Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney wrote in the Guardian newspaper. \n \nWriters´ group PEN International called on May to raise \"serious concerns about the grave violations\" being committed within the state of emergency imposed in Turkey after the coup. \n \nBritain\u2019s May in Turkey to seek stronger ties was posted in Business of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 29, 2017 and was last updated on January 29, 2017.

That would spark a rise in fuel costs across the country that would hurt East and West Coast refiners more than those near the Gulf of Mexico. \n \nIt would also hit the pocketbooks of drivers and airline passengers, as refiners pass on the nearly $30 billion that the tax could cost them each year on crude imports. \n \n\"The consumer is really the one that suffers,\" Cynthia Warner, executive vice president for operations at refiner Tesoro Corp, said earlier this month at a conference in Houston. Tesoro operates seven refineries: two in California, two in North Dakota and one each in Utah, Alaska and Washington.The \"border adjustment\" tax could also redraw trade maps for global flows of crude and refined products. U.S. crude producers would be the obvious beneficiaries as their overseas rivals bear heavy taxes on imports, which are used often by coastal refiners, especially those without direct access to U.S. pipelines. \n \nHigher prices for domestic crude would make pumping from more U.S. fields economically viable - encouraging higher output from the shale patch and giving more momentum to a nascent recovery in the U.S. shale industry after a brutal international price war. \n \nWhile that likely would not put a big dent in the 7.9 million barrels per day (bpd) that the U.S. imports, Goldman Sachs estimates that U.S. oil exploration and production firms would benefit to the tune of $20 billion from higher domestic crude price and increased production. \n \nCrude markets have been buffeted by the public back-and-forth between President Donald Trump and the Republican party over various tax proposals. \n \nContradictory signals from Trump sent the oil markets up and down in recent days. U.S. crude fell to its biggest discount to Brent crude in five months last week after Trump appeared to poured cold water on the idea as \"too complex\". \n \nThe next day, he said the tax would be discussed - and U.S. crude rose relative to Brent. \n \nTraders had speculated on the tax with an options bet that the value of U.S. crude would rise above the global Brent crude benchmark. Trump's comments caused volatility in trade of those options, which in turn impacted benchmark oil prices. \n \nInvestment bank Goldman Sachs estimated in a report this week the border tax proposal had a 20 percent chance of passing. But White House chief of staff Reince Priebus seemed to move the President closer to supporting the border adjustment tax on Thursday, in the context of discussing how to make Mexico pay for a security wall on U.S. border with Mexico, his signature campaign promise.  Asked if Trump favored a border adjustment tax, Priebus said such a tax would be \"one way\" of paying for the border wall. \n \nBorder taxes are part of a broader tax reform plan that is being pushed by Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan as an alternative to a variety of protectionist trade policies discussed in a more ad hoc way by Trump.While Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on specific industries or countries in an effort to boost U.S. manufacturing, Ryan's border adjustment tax would tax all imports at 20 percent. Exports would be tax-free. That could add more than $30 billion to the annual import bill for U.S. refiners, assuming an oil price of $53 per barrel on the 7.9 million bpd of imports that fuel the world's largest economy. \n \nA steep rise in import costs would squeeze the margins of refiners dependent on foreign crude shipments such as Chevron and PBF Energy.But all refiners would see feedstock prices rise if the tax pushed up domestic crude prices - and it would, because there is not enough U.S. crude to meet demand. \n \nTo cover the costs to refiners, retail gasoline prices would need to increase by 13 percent, or 30 cents a gallon, energy consultant Philip Verleger estimated in a report last month. Diesel would rise by 11 percent, or 27 cents a gallon. was posted in Business of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 29, 2017 and was last updated on January 29, 2017.

The bank cut the interest rate to the current level in May last year. \n \nThe bank said average inflation clocked in at 3.9 percent during the first half of the fiscal year of 2016/17, lower than the earlier projections due to smooth supply of perishable items, stable exchange rate, and government\u2019s absorption of the impact of higher international oil prices. \n \n\u201cThe current trends suggest that the actual inflation would be lower than the target rate of six percent in 2016/17,\u201d SBP\u2019s Governor Ashraf Mahmood Wathra said, unveiling the monetary policy decision for the January-February period. \n \n \u201cBased on an assessment of the developments and after detailed deliberations, the monetary policy committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged.\u201d \n \nThe bank viewed stability in international oil prices in the short- to medium-term, however, it would remain vigilant \u201cto see how the international market will behave in the next six months.\u201d \n \nThe central bank projected the growth rate between five to six percent for the current fiscal year in line with the finance ministry\u2019s target of 5.7 percent. The growth rate was recorded at 4.7 percent \u2013 the highest rate in the past eight years \u2013 for the last fiscal year of 2015/16. \n \nThe World Bank increased its growth forecast for Pakistan to 5.2 percent for fiscal year 2017, 0.7 percent up from its earlier projection, while International Monetary Fund projected the GDP growth rate at five percent for the current fiscal year. \n \nThe SBP\u2019s committee said healthy credit expansion, along with higher production of Kharif (summer) crops, visible improvements in energy supply and upbeat business sentiments, \u201csignal recuperating real economic activities.\u201d \n \n\u201cLarge-scale manufacturing grew 3.2 percent during the first five months of the current fiscal year and further increase is expected on account of growing infrastructure spending and recent policy support for export-oriented sectors,\u201d the bank said in a policy statement. \n \nThe assumption of rise in domestic demand and economic activity is supported by Rs180 billion worth of exports incentive package, recently announced by the government, for the struggling exporters.    \n \nThe central bank, however, sees risks to current account position if foreign inflows run short of supply. \n \n\u201cGrowing CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) -related imports, decline in exports, absence of coalition support fund, and slowdown in remittances pushed the current account deficit to $3.6 billion in the first half of FY17, from $1.7 billion in the same period last year,\u201d it said. \u201cThis higher deficit was financed by an increase in bilateral and multilateral funding along with pickup in investment flows. Overall surplus in the balance of payments stands at $0.2 billion in the first half of the current year.\u201d  With the aforementioned risks to the external sector, the need of financial inflows would grow further, it added. \n \nThe SBP\u2019s governor said capital goods, including machinery and plants, were the major catalyst to imports. He, however, said such imports would result in rising productivity. \n \nThe governor sees remittances to reach more than $20 billion during the current fiscal year. \n \nThe SBP said soft interest rate, couple with a sizeable net retirement of government borrowing to scheduled banks and an increase in bank deposits, helped increase private sector credit. \n \n\u201cBenefiting from the historic low interest rates, private businesses are actively borrowing from the banking sector for upgrading and expanding their business processes,\u201d the SBP\u2019s statement said. \u201cPrivate sector borrowed Rs375 billion in first half of FY17 as compared to Rs282.6 billion availed in the corresponding period of last year.\u201d   \n \nThe SBP said loans for fixed investments increased Rs134.1 billion in the first half of 2016/17 compared with an expansion of Rs83.8 billion in the same period of last year. \u201cDemand for consumer financing, especially for auto loans, also gathered pace during the first half of the year,\u201d it added. was posted in Business of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 29, 2017 and was last updated on January 29, 2017.

Last year, farmers used 2.2 million tonnes of diammonium phosphate (DAP) as compared to 1.8 million tonnes a year earlier. \n \nMohammad said demand of urea slowed down as farmers used more urea in previous years because of DAP\u2019s higher prices. \u201cNow, they are balancing consumption of the two fertilisers.\u201d \n \nThe government allowed 300,000 tonnes of fertiliser exports till April 28.  \n \nWith the imposition of gas infrastructure development cess (GIDC), cost of gas increased to five dollar per million metric British thermal unit (MMBtu), highest in the region. Middle East charges one dollar and China three dollar per MMBtu.  \n \n\u201cGIDC has an impact of Rs400 a bag. Our cost is higher but we are very efficient compared to rest of the world,\u201d Mohammad said. \u201cFertiliser production is not profitable on liquefied natural gas (LNG) as it costs eight dollar per MMBtu.\u201d \n \nStressing the need of fertiliser availability at lower rates to ensure food security, Engro Fertlizers chief said world over cost of production is being reduced in order to encourage farmers to grow grains. \n \nIn order to reduce impact of GIDC on fertiliser, the government is providing subsidy on urea as well as on DAP, which is mostly imported. Fauji Fertilizer is the only local DAP manufacturer. \n \nMohammad said it is time to focus on agriculture sector. \u201cIndia has reached to cotton production of 36 million bales while we are producing 10.5 million bales,\u201d he added. \u201cWe did not pay attention towards agriculture.\u201d \n \nHe said world is focusing on yield increase. Input cost is being brought down through multiple subsidies to farmers. \u201cExcept fertiliser subsidy, nothing goes to farmer in Pakistan.\u201d \n \nEngro Fertilizers imparted education to 5,000 farmers as its corporate social responsibility. This program helped them increase wheat production to 38 maunds per acre from 30 maunds per acre earlier. \u201cThere are eight million farmers in the country and there is need to educate them at the state level,\u201d Mohammad said. \n \nEngro Fertilizers to invest abroad in pesticides\u2019 manufacturing was posted in Business of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 29, 2017 and was last updated on January 29, 2017.

The \u201csanitised\u201d report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). \n \nThe report, whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986. \n \nThe very first sentence of the report\u2019s available (undeleted) page reads: \u201cPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\u201d It, however, later clearly said that \u201cassassination is the major near-term threat\u201d to him. \n \nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991. \n \nThe first section titled \u201cKey Judgments\u201d analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India\u2019s relations with the US, the then USSR and the region. \n \nThreats \n \nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi\u2019s life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder. \n \n\u201cIf Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures \u2014 including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India \u2014 were taken by the Indian President ...... (deleted),\u201d it said. \n \nInterestingly, it also names P.V. Narasimha Rao and V.P. Singh, who could be the \u201cinterim successor\u201d and \u201clikely candidates\u201d in case of sudden exit by Rajiv. Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991. \n \nIn a section, titled \u2018The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy\u2019, the report says \u201cIn our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv,\u201d besides \u201ca fanatical Hindu\u201d. \n \nSince a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis. However, another section deals in-depth with Rajiv\u2019s mediation efforts to resolve \u201cthe conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo...\u201d \n \nGandhi's departure \n \nBesides Gandhi\u2019s possible assassination, the report also analysed various scenarios of his \u201cabrupt departure\u201d from the political scene before 1989. \n \n\u201cAlthough we believe assassination is the major near-term threat to Rajiv\u2019s tenure, any of several other events could cause his abrupt departure from the political scene before 1989,\u201d it said while listing out several other possibilities including \u201chis death from natural causes or by accident\u201c. \n \nIt ruled out the possibility of a decision by him \u201cto resign out of frustration\u201d, saying \u201cwe see no signs of this and believe it would be out of character\u201c. \n \nThe CIA report also noted: \u201cWe suspect, however, that Rajiv would calculate \u2014 as we do \u2014 that he and his kin would be targets for extremist violence even if he left public office.\u201d \n \nIn a section called \u201cImplications for the United States\u201d, the report says \u201cWe believe (Rajiv) Gandhi\u2019s death would represent a significant blow to US interests, regardless of the circumstances of the succession.\u201d \n \n\u201d...We believe Indo-US relations could also suffer as a result of domestic political changes following Rajiv\u2019s assassination.\u201d \n \nThe report assessed Rajiv\u2019s policies ranging from dealing with extremists, foreign relations (including Sri Lankan Tamil issue) to promoting acquisition of selected foreign technology\u201d among others, and their outcome. \n \n\u201cAlthough some of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s policies will continue to encounter serious resistance over the next several years, we believe his dominance of the Indian political scene is secure until at least the end of his present term of office in December 1989, barring his incapacitation or death,\u201d it said. \n \nThe report also dealt with the possibility of a \u201cnational government\u201d taking over in case of a sudden exit by Rajiv, while discounting the possibility of a military coup in such a scenario. \n \nSeveral portions of the 23-page report were deleted before the CIA decided to release it under the Freedom of Information Act.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sri Lanka news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"}],"title":"8mins \u2018CIA assessed Rajiv assassination 5 years before he was killed\u2019","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"The Hindu","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169592117","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"917"},"name":"The Hindu","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hindu.com","publisher":"The Hindu Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200270708","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It is expected to focus on the need to boost growth and investment in Europe. \n \nEconomic growth \"must be at the centre\" of the EU´s policies, Gentiloni said Friday in Madrid after talks with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. \n \nHe also urged Brussels to show \"flexibility\" when it enforces deficit rules. \n \n\"Simply I think Italy needs expansionary economic policies,\" he said. \n \nThe Lisbon summit comes ahead of a February 3 meeting of EU leaders in Malta to look at the future of the bloc without Britain, its second-largest economy and its richest financial centre. \n \nAnalysts said forging a common front will be hard as southern EU nations have different priorities and many of the leaders who will be at the Lisbon summit are politically weak. \n \nHollande is not a candidate in France´s presidential election later this year and his Socialist party is trailing in the polls. \n \n\"So whatever Hollande promises or agrees this weekend will probably be forgotten by the middle of the year,\" Adriano Bosoni, senior Europe analyst at US private intelligence firm Stratfor, told AFP. \n \n\"The Italian government is also fragile. The Greek prime minister is struggling to keep his government alive,\" he added. was posted in Business of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 29, 2017 and was last updated on January 29, 2017.

FRANCISCO: In less than a year, Amazon's combination of the Echo speaker system and the Alexa voice-controlled digital assistant has come close to delivering on the elusive promise of easy-to-use technology that can control gadgets in the home with a few spoken words.Yet Amazon.com Inc's surprise success sets up a long-term battle with Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc's Google for primacy in the connected household. And the contours of that competition are following a classic tech industry dynamic. \n \nAmazon is pursuing an open-systems approach that allows quick development of many features, while Apple is taking a slower route, asserting more control over the technology in order to assure security and ease-of-use. \n \nThe strategic importance of the \"connected home\" niche looms large: Amazon wants a way to own its customer interactions -mainly shopping online - without an Apple phone or a Google Web browser as an intermediary. \n \nApple needs to keep the iPhone at the center of customers\u2019 lives, and has built a whole home automation architecture, called Homekit, into its smartphone. Google, for its part, is investing heavily in both intelligent assistant software and home-automation devices like the Nest thermostats and, more recently, the Google Home speaker. But Google is behind in the race, with its speaker only hitting the market in November and compatible with a handful of gadgets beyond Nest and Dropcam, which the company also owns. \n \nApple strategy in \u2018smart home\u2019 race threatened by Amazon was posted in Business of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 29, 2017 and was last updated on January 29, 2017.

At the time, policymakers signaled as many as three increases in 2017. \n \nBut no hike is expected on Wednesday and rates will remain at 0.50-0.75 percent until the second quarter, when another 25-basis-point rise is likely, a Reuters poll found. \n \nStrong labor market data, due on Friday, would lend credence to those expectations for a second quarter hike. A Reuters poll predicts a pick-up in non-farm payrolls. \n \nThe European Central Bank has had an ultra-loose monetary policy for years, with little chance of any change in the foreseeable future, as it has so far failed to get inflation anywhere near its close to 2 percent target. \n \nEuro zone inflation rose to 1.5 percent this month, flash data are expected to show on Wednesday, still a long way from target. Germany's is expected to rise to 2 percent. \n \nBut ECB President Mario Draghi has remained relatively comfortable about upward movements and relaxed about German calls for tighter policy as its inflation rate climbs. \n \n\"We expect inflation releases due this week from several countries to show prices are accelerating further. Oil is the main factor behind rapidly rising inflation; Brent crude was about 65 percent higher year-on-year in January 2017,\" said Achilleas Chrysostomou at Standard Chartered. \n \nAn increase in euro zone manufacturing is also expected to be confirmed with the release of purchasing manager indexes. \n \nA slowdown in growth in Britain's dominant service industry and among its manufacturers during January, after they finished 2016 strongly, is expected to be reported by Britain's purchasing managers' indexes. \n \nBritain's free-spending consumers again confounded warnings that June's Brexit vote would cause an immediate slowdown in the country's economy, driving robust growth in the final three months of 2016, data showed on Thursday. \n \nGross domestic product rose at a quarterly pace of 0.6 percent in October-December, keeping up the same above-average pace seen in the initial three months after the referendum decision to leave the European Union. \n \nBut economists have warned booming inflation and uncertainty around the terms of Britain's divorce from the EU could curtail growth rates this year. Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will trigger Article 50, starting the two-year countdown to leaving, by end-March. \n \n\"The Bank of England is expected to leave rates on hold next week and is likely to retain its position that a rate hike is just as likely as an interest rate cut,\" said James Knightley at ING. \n \n\"Certainly the recent data flow has been strong and inflation is on the rise, but there are tentative signs of a slowdown in employment growth while business surveys suggest a growing sense of caution surrounding Brexit.\" \n \nA recent Reuters poll suggested the Bank would leave its record-low interest rates and other stimulus measures unchanged at least until 2019. All but one of the 67 economists surveyed said there would be no tweaks in the next policy announcement on Thursday. \n \nThe Bank of England will also publish its quarterly Inflation Report. \n \nThe Bank of Japan, Central Bank of Kenya and the Central Bank of Russia all have the policy decisions, but none are expected to move. China continues celebrating its Lunar New Year so there will be little news from the world's second largest economy. was posted in Business of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 29, 2017 and was last updated on January 29, 2017.

The gains at the bourse were largely led by the enthusiasm/optimism of the local investors on strong domestic liquidity. \n \nThe KSE-100 shares index gained 1.21 percent or 598.89 points to close the week at 49,963.77 points. KSE 30-share Index was up 1.8 percent or 477.79 points to end at 26,914.44 points.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 33 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"64108","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Kansas City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kansas City Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667893","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1100"},"name":"Kansas City Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kmbc.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200275235","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The goods and services providers target urban markets because the average affluence is higher. The mindset among producers is the rural markets would not be able to afford their products. They leave the rural markets open to low quality informal producers that, in fact, charge the same prices for inferior products as there is no competition from the quality producers.  The rustic population buys ice cream, bakery bread, informal carbonated beverages, non branded toffees, candies and chocolates at almost the same rates as in the cities. They buy soaps, shampoos, toothpastes, and cosmetics of inferior quality at the standard prices of their quality counterparts. By ignoring the rural market the quality producers are in fact limiting their market size. The sales of motorcycles in the rural regions are higher than urban centers. The rural population prefers branded and dearer two-wheelers over the low end models. When the rural demand is slow the growth in motorcycle sales stagnates \u2013evident from the fact that motorcycle production almost came to a halt due to negative agricultural growth last year.  \n \nRural market also provided opportunities to mobile phone manufacturers and cellular network service providers. As the markets in the urban regions started shifting from analog to digital phones, sales of analog technology based telephones increased in rural areas. The rates of analog phones also declined which came within the buying range of the rural poor. The use of SMS increased more in rural regions as the consumers in cities shifted to WatsApp and Viber for exchange of messages and pictures.  \n \nThe current population of Pakistan is 195,058,089 (195.05 million) based on the latest United Nations estimates. About 39.2 percent of the population, which translates into 77.107 million (7,71,07,125 people in 2017), is urban, while the rest, which is the rural population stands at 117.95 million (11,79,50,964 people in 2017). The median age is 22.7 years. The consumption of food, goods and services is higher among the young. As the median age of rural population is lower than that of urban, they have higher consumption needs. \n \nIn textiles and clothing, the mushroom growth of brands pushed the nonbranded producers out of urban markets. They were then forced to pay attention to the rural market. Some of them imitated the designs of larger brands and marketed them in the rural regions. Now some larger brands are establishing their shops in semi urban and rural areas along the main highways.    \n \nThe rural population in Punjab has larger access to goods and services available in the big cities. This is because 80 percent of the population in Punjab lives around major highways like GT road. Moreover, road connectivity in the rural regions is better in Punjab followed by KP. The rural populations of Sindh and Balochistan remain largely deprived of better goods and services enjoyed by their urban peers. The businessmen must realize that in order to attain economies of scale and enlarge their market share they would have to develop products suiting the rural communities. was posted in Business of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 29, 2017 and was last updated on January 29, 2017.

But plenty did, culminating in a 17-12 loss to Argentina that meant the three-time defending champions finished sixth.  \n \nSouth Africa won the final, with a convincing win 26-6 over Fiji \n \nThe World Sevens Series continues in Sydney this weekend and New Zealand co-coach Waldrom is desperate for the change in scenery to also herald a change of fortunes. The team had been fairly chipper after beating England 24-0 on Sunday afternoon, but the Argentine defeat knocked the smile off everyone's face. \n \n  \n   \n   \n \n\"It's been a pretty tough week. We had to deal with a lot around the old [Gordon] Tietjens controversy, the poor [crowd] numbers and the lack of support and then the coach getting Bell's Palsy so his face is a bit munted and he's talking a bit funny,\" Waldrom said. \n \n\"The guys have been through a lot and to walk away on that note's been disappointing, because we know we're better than that.\" \n \nBell's Palsy is a kind of facial paralysis which affected Waldrom in the last few days and was the last thing he needed. \n \nParticularly at a time when the team have been under pressure regarding the lack of spectator interest in this tournament. One of the - many - remedies mooted has been for New Zealand to pick more \"name\" players. Who knows, it might work. In the meantime, though, that kind of talk hardly makes young players feel they deserve to be here representing New Zealand. \n \n\"We've tried to stay away from it. It's nothing we can control. Obviously better performances might get more support,\" said Waldrom. \n \nFiji's supporters at Westpac Stadium appeared to outnumber - and definitely out-sung - New Zealand's in Sunday's quarterfinal and that hurt the team. \n \n\"Obviously we were out-supported by the Fijians in that one and to me it felt the Argentinian crowd was even louder than ours. That's a little bit disappointing for the boys that when they do get to play in front of a home crowd, it's not there.\" \n \nA lack of support won't hurt so much when the team hit Sydney where Waldrom is confident they'll be better. They'll definitely need to be, because they can't continue to make the sort of soft errors and missed tackles that thwarted their title aspirations in Wellington. \n \n\"There was some pretty stern words from everyone after that [Argentine] game and we're certainly good enough. You've just got to look at some of the games yesterday [Saturday] and the England game,\" Waldrom said. \n \n\"If we can put in six games like that then we can certainly be a contender for the cup.\" \n \nTim Mikkelson hobbled off early against Argentina and captain Scott Curry copped a few knocks too. Waldrom indicated that New Zealand would probably take the same side to an event at which they're again the defending champions. \n \nSouth Africa will be the undoubted favourites in Sydney after claiming their convincing win at Wellington.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HAMISH BIDWELL"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"NZ Sevens team happy to leave Wellington and lick their wounds","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Waikato Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169690101","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Waikato Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200285573","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n \n___ \n \nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n \nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \n \n___ \n \nFAIRFAX, VIRGINIA \n \nDozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. \n \n___ \n \nDENVER \n \nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. \n \n___ \n \nCHICAGO \n \nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n \nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday. \n \nAmong those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n \nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n \nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n \nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" \n \n__ \n \nDALLAS \n \nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n \nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition. \n \nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n \nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \n \nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n \n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n \n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n \n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" \n \n___ \n \nSEATTLE \n \nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. The first one was the Women's March. \"It's not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. \n \n___ \n \nPORTLAND, OREGON \n \nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\" \n \n___ \n \nLOS ANGELES \n \nAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil. \n \nAvriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis. \n \n___ \n \nSAN FRANCISCO \n \nHundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport's international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. \n \n___ \n \nSAN DIEGO \n \nAs motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests erupt at airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Saline","zipCode":"67401","state":"Kansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Salina","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Salina Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169686121","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Salina Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.salina.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://NorthJersey.com/"],"sequenceId":"695200295442","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:28:05Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/salina.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/50/350b81a4-6dae-5847-892c-ef2bfb72a386/588d9ddf1b46d.image.jpg?resize=300%2C196"}],"video":[]}}

A fantastic tournament for the likes of Scotland and Canada but a poor finish for the All Blacks Sevens after showing such promise yesterday. The series now heads to Sydney next weekend with South Africa well and truly sitting top of the table after a commanding weekend. \n   \n8:50pm: South Africa 26 v Fiji 5 - Cup FINAL \n   \nIt's a glorious gold for South Africa as Seabelo Senatla achieves his own personal milestone in become the top try scorer of all time for the Blitzboks with 180. They're Champions in Wellington for the first time since 2002, and they stretch their lead at the top of the HSBC 2016-17 Sevens Series standings. \n   \n8:40pm: Halftime: South Africa 7 v Fiji 5 - Cup FINAL \n   \nTwo points and a Fiji yellow card is all that separates the two teams. Both giving it their all so far! \n   \n8:18pm: Scotland 28 v Canada 22 - 3rd Place \n   \nScotland the Brave!  Canada held the lead with 30s to go but James Fleming seals the day with his third try of the game and carries Scotland to bronze. They are already celebrating on the pitch and can you really blame them? The hat-trick hero says it was a full squad effort that produced this weekend's result. \"It was an enjoyable game, it was a whole squad effort. We have been building for the last two years, new coach, consistent squad, and Twickenham gave us belief. We\u2019re looking forward to the next one. We are hitting quarters and semis consistently now and it is awesome to have the squad we do.\" \n   \n7:48pm: NZL 12-17 ARG \n   \nTRY! Pumas win it at the death as NZL choke up the ball with pass to who knows inside their own half. The ball goes to ground and Argentina grubber it on and they're in as the hooter goes. That's that then. Two more games to go - Scotland v Canada for 3rd and South Africa v Fiji for the cup! \n   \n7:46pm: NZL 12-12 ARG \n   \nTRY! All Blacks Sevens with a costly turnover i ntheir own 22 after they are penalised for not releasing the pill. Argentina jump on it and score far right corner. Game on with a minute to go! \n   \n7:42pm: NZL 12-7 ARG \n   \nTRY! Curry's in after the ABs Sevens get a penalty inside Argentina's 22 for offside. The setpiece is a double cut and Curry comes onto the second change of direction at pace and there's no stopping him 5m out. NZ back in front! \n   \n7:39pm: NZL 5-7 ARG \n   \nKoroi shows another piece of magic to get into open field before delivering a no-look flick pass to Curry. Curry is brought down on Argentina's forty and he knocks it on! Halftime. \n   \n7:37pm: NZL 5-7 ARG \n   \nTRY! Argentina keep attacking up the middle of the field and it pays off as the black wall crumbles. good forty metres gained from relentlessly running off the rucks and it results in a try under the posts. \n   \n7:32pm: NZL 5-0 ARG \n   \nTRY! Simple draw and pass play off a scrum inside Argentina's 22 and Koroi is over on the far right. Good start from NZL! \n   \n7:30pm: NZL 0-0 ARG  \n   \nWe're underway in the fifth place final. Argentina to kick off.Mikkelson is injured early and it looks like a finger or thumb dislocation. He's on the side getting addressed to. \n   \n7:20pm: Kenya 19 v Australia 17 - Trophy FINAL \n   \nWHAT A FINISH! Kenya was up 19-12 with seconds to go before a costly turnover gives Australia the ball in Kenya's half. Australia apply pressure and get a penalty close to the line. They take it quickly and dot down right in the left corner for a tough conversion. The drop kick goes up and it's beautiful, it's got the length but it curls away from the right post and it's just wide! Kenya claim the trophy in another stunning final! More of this to come please! \n   \n6:46pm: Russia 12 v Samoa 19 - 13th Place FINAL \n   \nTietjens' men finish on a high note in another physical match. Samoa had nearly double the tackles than their European opponents but they didn't budge in the final moments. Samoan captain Tila Mealoi wrapped up their weekend saying they are still developing under the Kiwi coach. \"I'm proud of my team, it's quite young and there are a few new guys in the team. We are really happy and really proud. We have given a springboard to the new guys, and we are now working on some structure with Sir Gordon. There is a big improvement in our fitness, which is the first thing we are looking at.\" \n   \n6:03pm: Canada 5 v South Africa 21 - Cup SF \n   \nThe Blitzboks were just too fast. Ans when Canada realised that and went physical, the South Africans beat them at the breakdowns too. Clinical performance from South Africa as it has been all tournament. We are in for two thrilling matches to close the tournament. The final will be at 8:30pm. \n   \n5:43pm: Scotland 12 v Fiji 19 - Cup SF \n   \nHeartbreaking for the Scots. They held a five point lead with two minutes to go but the Flying Fijians find the line twice. You can't help but feel for the Scots. They were playing brilliant rugby but their opponents find a second gear and took the lead with 30s to go before a penalty on the hooter saw them tap and gap for another try to secure it with a statement. Brilliant match regardless. Up next is Canada and South Africa. Can the Canadians do the unthinkable? \n   \n5:13pm: Argentina 19 v France 14 - 5th Place SF \n   \nSo it'll be Argentina that takes on the All Blacks Sevens in the 5th place final. The Los Pumas Sevens made twice as many tackles as France but never let that defence fall in crucial times.  \n   \n4:50pm: NZL 24-0 ENG \n   \nTRY! Stowers goes in in the far right corner on the fulltime hooter and that's a performance much more like yesterday's dominance. All Blacks Sevens looked the better team the entire match and discipline let England down big time. Easily man of the match has to go tou youngster Koroi. His first ever Sevens Series and he is proving to be quite the playmaker. NZL now wait on the winner of Argentina v France to find their opponent for the 5th place final. \n   \n4:42pm: NZL 17-0 ENG \n   \nTRY! That might just be the nail in the coffin! Beautiful skip pass again from Koroi and it's Iopu-Aso is over the chalk in the left corner.  \n   \n4:38pm: NZL 12-0 ENG \n   \nTRY! Set piece inside the 22 off a penalty tap and Ware is the benefactor this time from another great pass by Koroi. The youngster is playing superb! That takes us to halftime. \n   \n4:33pm: NZL 7-0 ENG \n   \nTRY! The captain's in under the posts! Brilliant hands on a play that started in their own 22! Koroi breaks away and gets a flashy pass off to his skipper to score. Great start! \n   \n4:30pm: NZL 0-0 ENG - 5th Place SF \n   \nWe're back underway in the Cake Tin with the All Blacks Sevens hoping to make fans happy again after a tough loss to Fiji this morning ended their hopes of defending their Wellington title. ENG to kick off. \n   \n3:42pm: Australia 24 v Wales 10 - Trophy SF \n   \nMcDermott and Taylor have led a fiery performance by the Australians to book a Trophy final with Kenya after seeing off Wales. Both youngsters were aggressive from the first whistle and happy to take risks to break the line to claim the win - it worked. \n   \n3:18pm: Kenya 19 v USA 12 - Trophy SF \n   \nKenya have held on against the USA in a thrilling, flying trophy semi-final. Both teams making impressive breaks but chsed down by some of the fastest in the game. That ends USA's tournament while Kenya now wait to face either Australia or Wales. \n   \n2:55pm: Tietjens' Samoa get the job done convincingly with a 35-7 win over Papua New Guinea . Too many line breaks to keep track of and it's an easy win. They'll face Russia for 13th place. \n   \n2:36pm:  Russia come out ahead of Japan in a physical 15-5 clash. Russia smothered Japan's chances by keeping ball in hand for most part of the 13th place semi final. They will now play the winner of this next match between Papua New Guinea and Samoa. \n   \n2.05pm - South Africa 45 v France 0 - Cup QF \n   \nThe Blitzbokke have thrashed the French 45-0, looking to be the hot favourites in the tournament now with NZ going down to the Fijians earlier in the afternoon.   \n   \n1.47pm - Canada 17 v Argentina 12 - Cup QF \n   \nThe dream run for the Canadians continues after they held out a last attempt by the Argentinians.  \n   \n1.22pm - New Zealand 10 v Fiji 26 \n   Joeli Lutumailagi scored two long range tries in his side's 26-10 Cup quarter-final win over NZ. \nSource: SKY   \nNew Zealand score a consolation try through Tim Mikkelson with the Fijians marching their way to the Cup semis with a dominant win over NZ. \n   \n1.18pm - New Zealand 5 v Fiji 26 - Cup QF \n   \nTRY!

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 34 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lancaster","zipCode":"17603","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169674001","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"WGAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200307764","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Firing off a monster 2:06.67 at the Tatsumi International Swim Centre tonight on Tokyo, Watanabe became the first man ever to score a sub-2:07 200 breast, easily overtaking the previous world record mark by .34 seconds. \n \nThe elusive 200 breast World Record was previously held by countryman Akihiro Yamaguchi with the 2:07.01 he set in 2012. Although Yamaguchi has been silent ever since, Watanabe has quietly and steadily been on the rise, having broken the World Junior Record in this event back in May 2015. Although it\u2019s since been overtaken by Russia\u2019s Anton Chupkov, Watanabe\u2019s junior mark of 2:09.75 from just less than 2 years ago gives an eye-opening view of this young man\u2019s progression in the event. \n \nWatanabe made a run at an Olympic gold medal in the 200 breast, heading into the Rio final with a newly-minted Olympic Record of 2:07.22 in the semi-finals. Unable to replicate that caliber of performance, the teen ultimately finished in 6th place overall in a slower 2:07.87. \n \nHowever, with tonight\u2019s performance, Watanabe may have just foreshadowed a thrilling breaststroke performance that may be in store come the 2020 Olympic Games when the then-23-year-old may be performing in front of a home crowd. \n \nMen\u2019s 200 Breaststroke \u2013 All-time \n  Ippei Watanabe, JPN (2017) \u2013 2:06.67  Akihiro Yamaguchi, JPN (2012) \u2013 2:07.01  Josh Prenot, USA (2016) \u2013 2:07.17  Daniel Gyurta, HUN (2013) \u2013 2:07.23  Ross Murdoch, GBR (2014) \u2013 2:07.30   \n*Splits for Watanabe\u2019s World Record are not yet available. \n \nRead the full story on SwimSwam : Japan\u2019s Ippei Watanabe Rocks New 200 Breast World Record In Sub-2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Loretta Race"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: Olympic Games news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: swimming news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Japan\u2019s Ippei Watanabe Rocks New 200 Breast World Record In Sub-2:07","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"SwimSwam","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"600282226","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"SwimSwam","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","Swimming"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"https://swimswam.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200307934","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:36:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn.swimswam.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/16388012_1386634188075711_5936235021997649589_n-360x480.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Delaware Valley news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bergen","zipCode":"07024","state":"New Jersey","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fort Lee","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Fort Lee Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172255688","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Fort Lee Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fortlee.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695200308144","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

After a small surge from Wasatch, which is touted as the No. 1 high school boys basketball team in Utah by many rankings, more shots from beyond the arc fell from LaMelo and LiAngelo, who combined for 17 of Chino Hills\u2019 27 first quarter points. \n \nScott had a run of his own to start the second quarter, scoring seven straight after a sequence that included an and-1 layup followed by back-to-back dunks that had the crowd buzzing. \n \n\u201cWhat teams are ranked doesn\u2019t matter to us, we treat every team the same,\u201d said Scott. \n \nBy halftime Chino Hills was up 60-35. \n \nThe high-scoring was even more impressive Saturday night due to Chino Hills\u2019 124-point performance against Damien on Friday night. \n \nBut scoring wasn\u2019t the only highlight. Center Onyeka Okongwu had seven blocks in the game. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s my role to be the defensive leader and I will continue to do that moving forward,\u201d Okongwu said. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel any pressure at all (when it comes to the win streak), I\u2019m just playing to win.\u201d \n \nChino Hills\u2019 next big test will come when it faces Oak Hill (VA) on Saturday in the Nike Extravaganza at Mater Dei High School. \n \nTop game scores from Rolling Hills Prep State Preview: \n \nBishop Montgomery topped Fairfax 79-55, Ethan Thompson poured in a game-high 25 for Bishop Montgomery (20-2) and Jamal Hartwell had 24 for Fairfax (19-2). \n \nSanta Margarita\u2019s (17-5) Kaden Rasheed scored a team-high 15 points to help the Eagles edge Corona Centennial 52-51.

He's one of the staff members, part of an increasingly grey workforce in an increasingly grey country. \n \n\"I enjoy talking to the people here. It's fun, but it's also hard work,\" Odaira said during a break from his caregiving duties on a recent day. \n \nJapan is considered a \"super-aging\" society. More than a quarter of the population is over 65, a figure set to rise to 40 percent by 2050. The average life expectancy is 85, and that means many Japanese remain relatively healthy for a good two decades after retirement age. \n \nAt the same time, the birthrate has plummeted to well below the level needed to keep the population stable. Now home to 128 million people, Japan is expected to number less than 100 million by 2050, according to government projections. \n \nThat means authorities need to think about ways to keep seniors healthy and active for longer, but also about how to augment the workforce to cope with labour shortages. \n \nEnter the septuagenarian caregiver. \n \nAt Cross Heart, more than half of the 119 caregivers are over 60, and 15 of them are over 70. \n \n\"When we advertise for people to work here, we get lots of responses from older people, not younger people,\" said nursing home director Kaori Yokoo in the lobby where residents were doing leg curls and chest presses on weight machines. \n \nThe foundation that runs this nursing home and others in Kanagawa Prefecture has raised the official retirement age to 70 but allows employees to keep working until 80 if they want to and can. Municipalities around the country are also actively recruiting people over 60 to do lighter duties at nursing homes. \n \nIt's one way of dealing with the problem. Meanwhile, researchers are working on robots that can lift the elderly out of beds and wheelchairs, and inward-looking Japan is slowly coming around to the idea that it may need to allow in more foreign workers. \n \nAlthough older workers have constraints - some can't do the heavier tasks - they also offer advantages over younger workers who want time off for their children, said Yokoo, who is 41. \n \n\"Plus, because they're close in age to the residents, they can relate to each other more,\" she said. \"We younger people think this must be nice for them. Older staff can understand things like physical pains more because they are living through the same things.\" \n \nSome of the older workers here are doing it because they need the money. For others, the money is a nice benefit, but the main motivation is the activity and sense of community. \n \nKiyoko Tsuboi, a 95-year-old who comes into the rest home during the day, said she likes having Odaira around. \n \n\"He's very attentive to our needs and knows things like how hot we like our tea. My son is not as kind as Odaira-san,\" Tsuboi said as Odaira cleared away the lunch dishes. \"He's quite active despite his age, and even though he's a man, he has an eye for detail.\" \n \nThe dynamic works well for Odaira, too, who started here 17 years ago after retiring from his job in the sales department of an auto parts maker. He works eight hours a day, four days a week. \n \nHis father died when he was small, his mother when he was 22. \"It's not like I'm replacing my mother, but I thought I could help someone else's parents,\" he said. \n \nHe also does it to stay young, Odaira said with a twinkle in his eye. \"I think it's good for me physically and mentally, so as long as I can keep working, I will.\" \n \nHe's not the oldest worker here, though. That title is shared by two 78-year-olds, a man who works in the office, and Noriko Fukuju, who helps with pickups and drop-offs and does activities with \"the old people.\" \n \n\"It's fun. I enjoy it,\" she said. \n \nHiroko Akiyama, at the University of Tokyo's Institute of Gerontology, said a Japanese 65-year-old is in much better physical and mental shape than a 65-year-old a few decades ago. \"They are full of energy, and healthy and long-living,\" she said. \n \nAkiyama's research has found that working helps keep seniors that way. \"They operate on a regular schedule. They wake up, get ready, go to work and talk to people and stay connected,\" she said. \"We had a depressed old woman who changed completely after she started working.\" \n \nStill, Japan can't rely solely on seniors or, potentially, robots to staff its nursing homes, where the need will only grow as the population ages, analysts say. \n \nJapan has agreements with Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines under which applicants who complete job training and pass a Japanese language test can work at a Japanese nursing home. \n \nBut if they want to stay beyond three years, they must pass a national caregiver's exam so difficult that 40 percent of Japanese applicants fail. Many Japanese also express concern about cultural differences. \n \nNext year, the Japanese government will loosen the regulations slightly and set up a technical intern program, but there will still be time limits and difficult tests to pass. \n \nPerhaps 2,000 people will come to Japan through the intern program, said Yasuhiro Yuki, an expert on elderly care at Shukutoku University. \"But we hear we will need 300,000 more caregivers in the next 10 years,\" he said. \"So I still don't think we will have enough.\" \n \nThat means aging caregivers will increasingly become the norm. \n \n\"I can do this at least for two more years,\" said Fukuju, the 78-year-old, before she dashed out the door to renew her driver's licence.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ANNA FIFIELD"},"topics":[{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Staff as grey as the residents","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southland Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169697795","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Southland Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200310641","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \nReleased under special circumstances \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n'The executive order is unlawful' \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \nLegality questioned \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \n© Distributed by LAKANA.

But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 34 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Norfolk","zipCode":"02494","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Needham Heights","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WCVB.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"352601084","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"415"},"name":"WCVB.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wcvb.com","publisher":"Hearst Television, Inc."},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200313719","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D.

TCL did show the BlackBerry-branded smartphone at the recently concluded CES 2017 event, and even allowed a hands-on of the device, but its specifications and features are still under wraps. A new leak however claims that the upcoming smartphone is likely to feature one of the best smartphone cameras. \nPosted on Twitter by Roland Quandt , the new BlackBerry Mercury is said to sport the same camera sensors as Google\u2019s Pixel smartphones. According to his tweet, the BlackBerry Mercury smartphone is likely to come with a 12-megapixel rear camera with Sony IMX378 sensors. The Google Pixel smartphones boast one of the best cameras, and it would be interesting to see if BlackBerry is able to emulate it on the Mercury. Up front, the BlackBerry Mercury is said to house an 8-megapixel selfie camera with either a Samsung S5K4H8 sensor or an Omnivision OV8856 sensor. \n \nUp until now, what we do know about the BlackBerry Mercury is that it will feature a combination of metal and rubberized body. The smartphone will feature a capacitive QWERTY keypad similar to the BlackBerry Passport. The interesting bit here is the placing of the fingerprint sensor which is embedded on the space bar of the smartphone. In terms of specifications, what has been confirmed so far is that it will feature a USB Type-C port for connectivity and on the software front, it will run on Android Nougat out-of-the-box. ALSO READ:  BlackBerry \u2018Mercury\u2019 smartphone with QWERTY keypad unveiled at CES 2017 \n \nAlthough there has been no official word on the rest of the specifications, leaks did not stop pouring though. The BlackBerry Mercury smartphone has been rumored to feature a 4.2-inch display, whereas some reports suggest a 4.5-inch display. At the core of the smartphone, the BlackBerry Mercury could run Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 821 chipset or Snapdragon 625 chipset. In terms of RAM and storage, the BlackBerry Mercury is said to come with 3GB of RAM and onboard storage of 32GB. There is no word on a microSD slot as of now.

St. John\u2019s opened up a big halftime lead and then rolled to the win.　 \n \nOLA struck first with a free throw while St. John\u2019s started slowly. It took them nearly four minutes to get on the board. Chloe Rakauskas gave them a lead with a drive, followed by a Casey Bachner score off a turnover. St. John\u2019s kept the pressure on. \n \nBroghan Laundry stole a pass and went coast-to-coast to make it 6-1 at the 9:58 mark. \n \nOLA slowly worked it ways back to even the game with four minutes left but St. John\u2019s got hot. Brooke Matela (five first half blocks) would show her offensive side with a 3-pointer and 30 seconds later, a Rakauskas steal led to a Sydney Bray lay up. \n \nSt. John\u2019s wasn\u2019t done. Olivia King grabbed an errant pass and fed Bray for a jumper, Bray then found Rakauskas for two, King scored, and Bachner made a free throw to send a stunned OLA into the half trailing by 12.　 \n \nRakauskas got things started in the second half with a 3-pointer off an out-of-bounds play and St. John\u2019s rolled from there. OLA got no closer than eight points and Paige Quagrello scored the last two baskets inside as St. John\u2019s took a 34-23 victory.　 \n \nChloe Rakauskas led St. John\u2019s with 15 points and nine rebounds. Matela blocked seven shots. Quagrello (six rebounds) and Olivia King (five rebounds) made sure that OLA would be limited on second shots. St. John\u2019s is now 6-0 on the season.　 \n \n  \n \nJan. 15: Pulaski saves Boys Cadets \n \nAt St. Clement\u2019s High School, the St. John\u2019s Boys Cadets took on St. Raphael of Medford. The game went right down to the buzzer with Luke Pulaski saving the day for St. John\u2019s.　 \n \nSt. John\u2019s struck first on a Zach Barden put-back, which was countered by a St. Raphael field goal. Cam O\u2019Brien drained a jumper and then laid one in off a perfect feed from Pulaski. \n \nThe game remained close as St. John\u2019s used its height advantage with Zach Barden dominating inside, scoring all 11 of his points. With 2:54 left in the half, a Johnny Cuttle 3-pointer assisted by Andrew Augustin gave St. John\u2019s its biggest lead of 23-14 but it did not last. \n \nWith several players in foul trouble, St. Raphael went on a 12-1 run to send a shocked St. John\u2019s team into the half down 26-24.　 \n \nSt. Raphael kept the streak going with an early 3-pointer to make it 29-24 but St. John\u2019s didn\u2019t panic. Andrew Augustin made a 3-pointer and after a turnover, Luke Pulaski scored inside to even the game. St. Raphael made one of two from the free throw line but on the miss, Cam O\u2019Brien found Augustin for a lay up and 31-30 lead. \n \nAugustin then stole the inbounds and fed O\u2019Brien for a 3-pointer to make it 34-30. The next few minutes was frantic, with both teams storming back and forth. With the game even, Augustin drove the lane for a floater to make it 40-38 St. John\u2019s with 6:36 left. \n \nSuddenly, the momentum changed. St. Raphael scored the next seven points to take a 45-40 lead. The comeback began with another O\u2019Brien 3-pointer to cut the lead to two. A Medford free throw followed as St. John\u2019s desperately looked for an open shot. \n \nThey finally got it. \n \nWith 2:21 left, Kaden Quirk hit a big 3-pointer from the right corner to even the game at 46-46. St. Raphael retook the lead, but Luke Pulaski kicked out a pass to O\u2019Brien for another three to give St. John\u2019s a 49-48 lead with 1:28 left but they couldn\u2019t hold it. \n \nSt. Raphael scored and then grabbed a turnover. Forced to foul, St. John\u2019s was called for an intentional foul. It gave Medford two free throws and the ball. Luck was with St. John\u2019s as they missed both free throws. \n \nOn the ensuing inbounds pass, O\u2019Brien fouled out of the game and put St. Raphael at the line again in a one and one situation. They missed again and St. John\u2019s had one last shot. After working the ball around the perimeter, Augustin drove to the basket and was fouled with six seconds left. \n \nAugustin had already achieved a double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds, but his free throws both were off the mark. Luke Pulaski slipped through to grab the second miss. Finding himself situated behind the rim, Pulaski used his left hand to go in for a reverse lay-up and it fell through with three seconds left. \n \nSt. Raphael could not in-bounds the ball as time expired, and St. John\u2019s escaped with a 51-50 road win.　 \n \nSt. John\u2019s was led by three players with double digits in scoring, Cam O\u2019Brien (15 points, five rebounds), Andrew Augstin (11 points, 11 rebounds, five steals, four blocks, and four assists), and Zach Barden (11 points, nine rebounds, two blocks). None of that mattered without Pulaski\u2019s (six points, nine rebounds) last second clutch rebound and basket. \n \n  \n \nJan. 21: Girls Cadets\u2019 Rakauskas too much for OLA \n \nAt Swampscott Middle School, the St. John\u2019s Girls Cadets took on Our Lady of Assumption of Lynnfield in the second of back-to-back home and away games. Led by the hot shooting of Chloe Rakauskas, St. John\u2019s was able to pull away for the win.　 \n \nSt. John\u2019s got started on a quick six-point run before OLA came roaring back to take the lead. Broghan Laundry evened the game up off a pass from Casey Bachner, but OLA answered with a 3-pointer. \n \nBoth teams were having trouble until Sydney Bray evened things up with a 3-pointer. Laundry then stole a pass and hit an open Chloe Rakauskas to make it back to back 3-pointers and a 14-11 lead at the 5:27 mark. \n \nThe two teams would match points with Paige Quagrello, Rakauskas and Brooke Matela scoring for St. John\u2019s as it kept a 3-point lead. A late Rakauskas free throw sent St. John\u2019s into the half with a 21-17 advantage.　 \n \nRakauskas opened the second half with an offensive put-back before OLA answered with a 3-pointer to make it 23-20. \n \nJust when a comeback appeared in the making, the St. John\u2019s defense heated up. Brooke Matela was blocking everything that came inside. \n \nHer block led to a Sydney Bray fast break basket to push the lead to five. Before OLA could react, Matela stole a pass and assisted on a 3-pointer by Rakauskas. St. John\u2019s turned up the defensive pressure, Bray (three steals) kept OLA from scoring. \n \nOlivia King grabbed an offensive rebound and put it in to push the lead to double digits. \n \nRakauskas\u2019 third 3-pointer of the night made it 34-23 with 8:14 left and led to an OLA time out. \n \nOut of the break, OLA cut the lead to 34-27 before Broghan Laundry answered with back-to-back baskets of her own. But OLA kept coming back as they closed the gap to 40-36 with three minutes left. \n \nSt. John\u2019s was riding the hot hand of Rakauskas as she hit another 3 to make it 43-36. She then made three of four free throws in the closing minute as St. John\u2019s pulled out a hard-fought 47-40 win.　 \n \nRakauskas led all scorers with 24 points, seven rebounds and five steals. Matela held a block party for OLA as she rejected 10 shots. Bray added seven points and three assists in the win. \n \n  \n \nJan. 21: Boys Cadets back on a roll \n \nAt the Swampscott Middle School, the St. John\u2019s Boys Cadets took on St. Mary\u2019s of Winchester II. St. John\u2019s scored the first seven points and then rolled to its fifth consecutive win.　 \n \nCam O\u2019Brien got things started with a 3-pointer just six seconds into the game. Zach Barden and Jared Gordon followed with baskets for a seven-point lead just 1:14 into the game. After a St. Mary\u2019s free throw, St. John\u2019s caught fire. \n \nO\u2019Brien went coast to coast, Gordon scored twice, Jordan Cummings made a jumper, and Jason Aucone ended the run with a conventional three-point play to give St. John\u2019s a commanding lead with 8:12 still left in the half. \n \nThe lead stayed that way with Cummings and John Caponigro each hitting 3-pointers down the stretch as St. John\u2019s entered the half with a 32-15 lead.　 \n \nAucone started an early second half run with a jumper just 16 seconds in and the route was on. Gordon scored twice, Zach Barden hit a driving lay up, Leo D\u2019Silva scored off a Kaden Quirk pass, and Caponigro made two free throws ending a 12-0 run to make it 40-15. \n \nSt. John\u2019s eased home for a 54-25 win.　Jared Gordon paced St. John\u2019s with 12 points while Jordan Cummings added nine points and six rebounds. Zach Barden grabbed 14 rebounds to go along with six points, three assists, and two blocks. With the win, St. John\u2019s improved to 8-1 on the season. \n \n  \n \nJan. 21: Fast start leads to Boys Bantams victory \n \nAt the Veteran\u2019s Memorial High School in Peabody, the St. John\u2019s Boys Bantams took on St. Adelaide White of Peabody. St. John\u2019s went on an 18-0 run to blow the game open and cruise to the win.　 \n \nSt. Adelaide struck first with an early 3-pointer to put St. John\u2019s in an early hole. It took nearly five minutes before Nate Jones took a steal the length of the court to get St. John\u2019s on the board. \n \nJackson Field followed with an offensive put-back 45 second later to retake the lead. From there, St. John\u2019s clamped down on defense. Another Jones steal led to a Ryan Ward layup, Jackson Field scored down low, Ward stole a pass and scored, and Max Field ended the half with St. John\u2019s on a 12-point run. \n \nSt. Adelaide did not score after the first minute. Jackson Field was dominating inside with 11 first half rebounds and three blocks. Defensively, St. John\u2019s had 10 steals led by Ward with five.　 \n \nThings did not get better for St. Adelaide in the second half. They had no answer for Jackson Field, who scored two early field goals and then fed his brother, Max, for a top of the key jumper as St. John\u2019s pushed its lead to 15. \n \nSt. Adelaide took one last shot at making it a game and they slowly cut the lead back to eight with 7:56 to go in the game. \n \nBut there would be no comeback. \n \nJackson Field scored off an offensive miss, Eli Zaklin made a jumper, and Tyler Chiarello ended the run to push the lead back to 14. St. John\u2019s closed it out for their second straight win.　 \n \nSt. John\u2019s was led by a double-double of 12 points and 21 rebounds by Field. Max Field grabbed 14 rebounds. Ryan Ward and Eli Zaklin each finished with six steals to polish off the win.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"St. John's CYO Basketball: Girls Cadets pull away for win over Lynnfield","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Essex","zipCode":"01945","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Marblehead","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wicked Local Swampscott","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688587","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"36"},"name":"Wicked Local Swampscott","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://wickedlocal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200323124","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:53:12Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:59:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Accurate documentation of patient symptoms in the EMR is important for high-quality patient care. Maria A. Woodward, M.D., M.S., of the University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, and colleagues examined inconsistencies between patient self-report on an Eye Symptom Questionnaire (ESQ) and documentation in the EMR. The study included 162 patients seen at ophthalmology and cornea clinics at an academic institution. \n\nThe researchers found that at the participant level, 34 percent had different reporting of blurry vision between the ESQ and EMR. Likewise, documentation was not in agreement for reporting glare (48 percent), pain or discomfort (27 percent), and redness (25 percent). Discordance of symptom reporting was more frequently characterized by positive reporting on the ESQ and lack of documentation in the EMR. Return visits at which the patient reported blurry vision on the ESQ had increased odds of not reporting the symptom in the EMR compared with new visits. \n\n\"We found significant inconsistencies between symptom self-report on an ESQ and documentation in the EMR, with a bias toward reporting more symptoms via self-report. If the EMR lacks relevant symptom information, it has implications for patient care, including communication errors and poor representation of the patient's reported problems. The inconsistencies imply caution for the use of EMR data in research studies. Future work should further examine why information is inconsistently reported. Perhaps the implementation of self-report questionnaires for symptoms in the clinical setting will mitigate the limitations of the EMR and improve the quality of documentation,\" the authors write. \n\nMore information: JAMA Ophthalmol.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 34 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Greenville","zipCode":"29609","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Greenville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WYFF4.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659149","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"107"},"name":"WYFF4.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wyff4.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200354833","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:59:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 31 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"40202","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Louisville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Louisville Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"540"},"name":"Louisville Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200355034","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:59:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It is also attempting to create its own state, which ISIS claims as a \u2018caliphate\u2019. But there can be no accommodation or negotiation with it,\u201d Trump said in his executive order. \n \n\u201cFor those reasons I am directing my administration to develop a comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS,\u201d he said. \n \nThe plan to be submitted to the President within 30 days calls for a comprehensive strategy to defeat the ISIS and recommend changes to any US rules of engagement and other American policy restrictions that exceed the requirements of international law regarding the use of force against the terror group. \n \nTrump said the ISIS has engaged in a systematic campaign of persecution and extermination in those territories it enters or controls. \n \n\u201cIf ISIS is left in power, the threat that it poses will only grow,\u201d he warned. \n \n\u201cWe know it has attempted to develop chemical weapons capability.

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n \nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport.

His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n \n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"David Ellery"},"topics":[{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Werriwa Wiener dash claims world dachsund record","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2622","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Braidwood","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Braidwood Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"348382630","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Braidwood Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.braidwoodtimes.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200366851","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:10:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:59:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/01e2e8d0-6ac5-4e81-9bc2-708dc395bfb7.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Photo: RNZ/ Jane Patterson \n  \nThey already have at least one clear division - over whether or not New Zealand should remain in the Five Eyes intelligence network. \n \nIn a symbolic move, Labour and the Greens launched their election year campaigns with their first joint State of the Nation event in Auckland today. \n \nSpeeches by Labour leader Andrew Little and Greens co-leader Metiria Turei contained no new policy, but sent a message to voters the two parties will work closely this year. \n \nMr Little was asked if New Zealand should stay in Five Eyes after comments made by the US President Donald Trump about sanctioning the torture of terror suspects. \n \nHe said Labour supported staying in the network, and that had not changed under Mr Trump's presidency. \n \n\"Five Eyes is about getting information that helps with the security of our nation. \n \n\"New Zealanders care about making sure they're safe and secure.\" \n \nMs Turei said the Greens had always opposed New Zealand's involvement. Their view remained unchanged. \n \n\"We've had different views on this for many, many years and you don't expect other parties to have exactly the same policy and on this. \n \n\"We disagree, that's perfectly fine, we can still work together to change the government.\" \n \nMr Little said no decisions have been made about electorate deals with the Greens in seats such as Ohariu and Auckland Central, but discussions were under way. \n \nHe said he had talked to the former Police Association President Greg O'Connor about a possible candidacy. \n \nMr Little would not comment about whether Mr O'Connor could stand in Ohariu - a seat currently held by the leader of one of National's support partners, United Future's Peter Dunne. \n \n\"I've known Greg for a long time and I've spoken to him myself, more recently... They were conversations, but I talk to a lot of people and most people want those conversations to be kept within the spirit of what they take place, which is, you know, a sounding out, showing an interest - and that's kind of as far as it's got.\" \n Housing, jobs top priorities  \nIn their State of the Nation speeches, both Mr Little and Ms Turei emphasised the \"shared values\" of the two parties, while launching an attack on the National-led government and new Prime Minister Bill English. \n \nWhile introducing the speakers, comedian Guy Williams talked about politics overseas and the \"man who shall not be named\"; then asked the interpreter for the deaf to show the audience how to sign Donald Trump - she obliged with a flick of the hand at her forehead (denoting a certain infamous hairstyle). \n \nTo an audience of about 300 to 400 Labour and Green supporters in a hall in Mt Albert, Mr Little talked about his personal battle with cancer. \n \n\"It made me think about seizing opportunities; about making the best of this life. \n \n\"My battle with cancer colours everything I see, even today.\" \n \nMr Little laid out his party's campaign priorities of jobs, affordable housing and a better standard of living. \n \nHe alluded to politics in the United States, saying with \"President Trump in the US, and the Far Right in Europe - holding onto a positive, inclusive vision is more important than ever\". \n \nMr Little criticised Mr English, calling him a \"competent bean counter\" and saying since taking office he had \"failed the first tests of leadership\" by refusing to commit to fighting harder to reduce poverty, or solve the housing crisis. \n \nHe said Mr English should front up in Waitangi next weekend, and that he should have sacked his friend and Cabinet colleague Nick Smith in last year's reshuffle. \n \nMs Turei acknowledged the former party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons for her environmental campaigns and the battles of the late Helen Kelly for employee rights. \n \nShe talked about the walk out in Parliament last year by female Green and Labour MPs in response to accusations by then-Prime Minister Jon Key that opposition MPs were \"backing the rapists\" during a debate over New Zealanders held in detention in Australia. \n \n\"That was a moment when our parties stood together and stood up for our values. \n \n\"I don't need to ask the values of the people here. Or to look up feminism in the dictionary, unlike Bill English. \n \n\"I don't need to ask whose side we're on.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Greens and Labour divided over intelligence network","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Radio New Zealand","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169699817","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"66"},"name":"Radio New Zealand","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.radionz.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200375933","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:59:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

After Hiatt whistled his way through parts of \"Marlene,\" Lovett said he thinks Hiatt should be king of the WWF - the World Whistling Federation. \n \nBut they also talked a lot about each other's music. And listening to them talk, you could tell they had really listened to each other's songs. \n \nThey talked about specific lines in each other's songs. After Hiatt played \"Icy Blue Heart\" from his brilliant 1988 album, \"Slow Turning,\" Lovett joked about the drink the woman orders in the song. \n \nIn the song, when asked by a man in a bar what she wants, the woman replies, \"Give me a love that don't freeze up inside.\" \n \nHiatt and the audience laughed. But such banter also revealed why they're both such great songwriters. It's because they're both great listeners, great observers. They take the time to really get to know other people's songs and the songwriters who wrote them. \n \nAnd that's probably why Lovett and Hiatt exist in such a rare, special place in the music world. \n \nNeither one has ever had a huge, hit record. They don't sell out stadiums or perform at the Super Bowl. \n \nBut such megastars often come and go faster than real shooting stars, their careers flaming out in the wake of the next big thing. \n \nIn contrast, Lovett and Hiatt are marathon runners of the music world. \n \nInstead of chasing hits or instant stardom, they're in it for the long haul. For decades, they have been producing piercing songs that cut through the noise and reveal truths about ourselves we always suspected but could never quite put into words. \n \nThat's why they don't need to worry about whether they have a flashy, new record before they hit the road. Like The Grateful Dead during their heyday, they know their fans will be there for them, no matter where they are on their musical journey. \n \nOn Saturday, dressed in dark suits and ties, they took turns playing their songs for two and a half hours seated side-by-side on stage. They also often joined in on each other's songs, often to sing the chorus or an entire verse. Other times, they joined in on harmonica, including when Hiatt did so while Lovett sang \"White Boy Lost In The Blues.\" \n \nMany of the songs were familiar ones loved by fans. In fact, some fans shouted out their requests, especially for Hiatt, who seemed happy to oblige. \n \nHiatt has always had a subtle touch. Born and raised in Indiana, he cut his songwriting teeth in Nashville, where he wrote songs for many other performers for years in the 1970s. He eventually carved out his own, unique niche writing and performing his own songs. \n \nHiatt writes with laser-like precision about everyday people. Like characters in a Raymond Carver story, the people in Hiatt's songs are often teetering on the margins, struggling with issues that never make the headlines. Although it would be easy to miss such serious undertones since many of his down-to-earth songs are so damn catchy. \n \nDecades later, albums like \"Slow Turning\" and \"Bring The Family\" still resonate. And on Saturday, several songs from both these albums from the 1980s brought the crowd to their feet. But Hiatt isn't coasting on his old hits. He can still write great tunes and played several from his sensational 2014 album, \"Terms of My Surrender.\" \n \nLovett seems to defy classification. A Texas-troubadour who looks like he stepped out of a sepia-toned photograph, he can turn an everyday occurrence, like reading over someone's shoulder or wishing he had a boat, into something magical. \n \nLovett briefly entered the entertainment stratosphere in the 1990s when he married the movie star Julia Roberts. But even since returning to earth, nothing seems to faze him. Whether he's playing with a few musicians or a \"large band\" or solo acoustic shows with Hiatt, he always seems to keep his cards close to his vest. \n \nBut don't let Lovett's poker face fool you. Beneath his wry banter and stone-faced jokes, he knows how to keep an audience enraptured with his spellbinding songs about life on the prairies or the wide-open spaces in south Texas, where Lovett still lives in the small town of Klein, where he was born and raised. \n \nOn Saturday, Lovett played several of his best-known works from albums like \"The Road to Ensenada\" and haunting songs like \"Nobody Knows Me\" or \"North Dakota.\" \n \nBut you don't have to be from North Dakota or Klein to appreciate Lovett's talent. And that's probably why he and Hiatt continue to pack theaters with adoring fans around the world, year after year. \n \nTheir songs defy boundaries, defy classifications. They're timeless and perfect for our imperfect times. \n \nSETLIST \n \n1) The Open Road (Hiatt) \n \n2) The Road to Ensenada (Lovett) \n \n3) The Tiki Bar Is Open (Hiatt) (by request) \n \n4) Downhill From Here (Lovett) \n \n5) Feels Like Rain (Hiatt) \n \n6) Her First Mistake (Lovett) \n \n7) Cry Love (Hiatt) \n \n8) Unnamed Guy Clark song (Lovett) \n \n9) Lipstick Sunset (Hiatt) \n \n10) Good Intentions (Lovett) \n \n11) Marlene (Hiatt) \n \n12) I've Been To Memphis (Lovett) \n \n13) Perfectly Good Guitar (Hiatt) (by request) \n \n14) White Boy Lost In The Blues (Lovett) \n \n15) Icy Blue Heart (Hiatt) \n \n16) Give Back My Heart (Lovett) \n \n17) Long Time Coming (Hiatt) \n \n18) Nobody Knows Me (Lovett) \n \n19) Drive South (Hiatt) \n \n20) Fiona (Lovett) \n \n21) Thing Called Love (Hiatt) \n \n22) Church (Lovett) \n \n23) Memphis in the Meantime (Hiatt) \n \n24) If I Had a Boat (Lovett) \n \nENCORE \n \n1) Have A Little Faith In Me (Hiatt) \n \n2) North Dakota (Lovett)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ken Ross"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: theater news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Concert Review: Lyle Lovett, John Hiatt right at home at Northampton's Calvin Theatre","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Hampden","zipCode":"01101","state":"Massachusetts","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springfield","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"MassLive","feed":{"genre":"Blog","tags":[],"id":"169659891","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"MassLive","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.masslive.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200376123","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:59:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media.masslive.com/republican/photo/2017/01/28/21960414-large.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Here are some key questions about the pact which supporters said would write the rules for 21st-century commerce: \n \nWhat is the TPP? \n \nIt is one of the most ambitious free-trade pacts yet negotiated. \n \nIt brings together some of the diverse economies that abut the Pacific Ocean \u2013 Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the US and Vietnam \u2013 and accounts for a whopping 40percent of the global economy. \n \nUnder former US president Barack Obama, it was sold to American allies as a unique opportunity to seize the initiative on worldwide trade \u2013 and ensure China, with its surging economy and growing global importance, did not get to dictate the terms. \n \nSupporters say it would scrap barriers to the free flow of goods, services and investment capital. \n \nThey claim it would also ensure a level playing field for all firms, protecting labour rights and incorporating important environmental safeguards. \n \nSo why has Trump junked it? \n \nCritics say the TPP was hammered out during secretive meetings in luxury hotels and will do little other than benefit the usual suspects \u2013 big businesses. \n \nTrump\u2019s insurgent presidential bid was built, in part, on a pledge to overturn the trade deals which many of his supporters blame for lost US jobs. They say the TPP was another bad deal for America\u2019s industrial heartlands, allowing foreign manufacturers and food producers tariff-free access to the US market \u2013 meaning US firms and farms, whose production costs are higher, could not compete. \n \nWhat will happen to the TPP? \n \nMany leaders invested serious political capital in the TPP, selling it to reluctant electorates as a way to yoke America closer to the like-minded democracies of the Pacific Rim. \n \nOne option is for the remaining 11 members to press ahead and get the agreement up and running. Australia said it hoped to recast the pact without the US and opened the door for China to sign up. \n \nAnother possibility is to re-open negotiations from scratch, which would give Trump the chance to sell an \u201cimproved\u201d deal to his electorate. \n \nTrump, however, suggested he would pursue bilateral deals, saying he would be \u201cgoing back to those countries one-on-one\u201d to find terms more favourable to the US. \n \nAre there other options? \n \nYes. The Beijing-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership now being negotiated, which brings together the 10 Southeast Asian countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, as well as China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. \n \nSomething of a mirror image to TPP, it includes six of the Washington-led grouping\u2019s 12 members but not the US, and would encompass more than 3billion people. \n \nThe Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership is generally seen as less ambitious on issues like employment and environmental protection. \u2013 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Free-trade deal in limbo","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"African Independent","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"601213584","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"African Independent","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.africanindy.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200376298","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:59:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport on Friday night and was detained for about five hours. \n\nTrump's order signed on Friday upended the travel plans of people without U.S. citizenship who were arriving in the United States from those seven countries, including Syria, Iran and Sudan, causing confusion and sparking protests at airports as immigrants and refugees were stranded. \n\nElamin said she had been in Sudan for academic research and boarded a plane on Friday morning. After presenting her U.S. green card, a designation of legal permanent residence, at JFK, she said she was questioned, patted down and handcuffed. \n\n\"It was an uncomfortable pat down, they touched my breast area and my groin area,\" Elamin said in a phone interview. \"Then I got handcuffed and I just started crying.\" \n\nElamin said the handcuffs were soon removed and it appeared authorities were using them to escort people between areas of the airport. \n\nElamin was released, but she worried about leaving the country again and about her parents in Sudan, whom she hoped one day to help immigrate to America. \n\n\"It scares me that I'm not able to see them if I want to,\" said Elamin, who lives in New Jersey. \n\nTrump's executive order means legal permanent residents who have passports from the seven countries have to be cleared back into the United States on a case-by-case basis, a senior U.S. administration official told reporters. \n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which overseas entry at airports, in a statement later said it will \"treat all of those we encounter humanely and with professionalism.\" \n\nThe executive order also upended the plans of some people planning to leave the United States. \n\nShirana Navabha, 57, a U.S. citizen originally from Iran, said she was scheduled to fly to Iran on Sunday, but will not go after Tehran said it would stop U.S. citizens entering the country in retaliation to Trump's action. \n\n\"I told everybody that I'm coming, everyone was so excited and now I'm not going, it's just frustrating,\" Navabha, who lives in Dallas, said by phone. \n\n(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Editing by Stephen Coates)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sudan news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"North Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"'I got handcuffed and just started crying' - Sudanese student describes U.S. detention","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"SG","country":"Singapore"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Yahoo!

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n\nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen. Tashfeen Malik was from a family of wealthy landowners in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia with her immediate family.

Without funds for an attorney, I accepted deferred probation. It has followed me my entire life. \n \nI graduated from college, law, and graduate school, yet I had to endure a hearing to ascertain my fitness to practice. It also caused employment rejection. \n \nLater, as assistant county attorney in El Paso, and elected district attorney in Willacy County, I routinely dismissed pot cases. Prosecutor\u2019s offices have limited budgets, yet mountains of cases. Dismissing marijuana offenses, allowed me to send more dangerous criminals to prison. \n \nEven probation for pot was wasteful. Curfews and reporting requirements should be for prowlers and burglars, not pot smokers. \n \nThis problem persists, as 620,000 Americans were arrested for pot last year. Yes, illegal marijuana creates jobs for probation officers, prosecutors, bailiffs, chemists, clerical staff and many more; however taxpayers get soaked. \n \nCalifornia and three other states legalized marijuana on Nov. 8. Voters were persuaded by the Colorado experience, where $2.4 billion in revenues and 17,000 jobs were created in legalization\u2019s first year. Some of this boom comes from visiting Texans. \n \nThe Denver Post polled, \u201cWould you repeal legalization?\u201d The answer; \u201cNo\u201d, by a 51 percent to 36 percent margin. Gallup\u2019s 2016 poll showed support for legalization has grown to 60 percent nationally, and recent studies demonstrate no increased use among youngsters since legalization. Colorado is booming, and other states want what they\u2019re smoking. \n \nThe old \u201cReefer Madness\u201d arguments against marijuana have been dispelled. Today\u2019s legalization opponents such as Insys Therapeutics, which develops synthetic painkillers, poured $500,000 into the \u201cNo\u201d vote in Arizona. It\u2019s these legal painkillers which cause so much addiction and harm. \n \nPrescription drugs increase our health costs and Big Pharma doesn\u2019t want competition. The Catholic Church was also a huge contributor, with the Boston Archdiocese donating $850,000 to oppose Massachusetts\u2019 marijuana initiative. \n \nOne lingering anti-pot argument is that people will ingest and drive. This happens anyway and it will be illegal everywhere. \n \nNot satisfied, opponents wonder how they will test for marijuana. Field tests still work, but how about we just arm each officer with a chocolate bar, and they could cuff the stoned drivers as they grab for it. \n \nLegalization will come eventually, as it\u2019s only the oldest age groups who are opposed. \n \nAn estimated 15 million Americans use marijuana regularly, and about half our population has admitted trying marijuana. \n \nMarijuana decriminalization bills for the 2017 Texas Legislature, have been filed, including one by El Paso\u2019s own Joe Moody. \n \nRepublicans are increasingly in favor, because of the fiscal benefits and individual freedom arguments. Democrats are already there, and almost everyone wants to decrease the power of the violent drug cartels who smuggle pot across our border. \n \nLet\u2019s legalize it, and have Mexico put up the wall to keep Texans from trafficking marijuana into their country. \n \nEl Paso attorney Steve Fischer has been a professor of criminology and a Texas State Bar director.

You know, it's the time of the year, where we look at it purely as a business, there's a lot of events around.  \n \n\"But it's been such an iconic Wellington event, we still want to hold it and, if we can turn it around, we'd like to be part of that.\" \n   \nWestpac Stadium chief executive Shane Harmon said the tournament went well from an operational perspective, but poor crowd numbers were a worry for organisers. \n   \nNew Zealand Rugby executive member Nigel Cass will host a conference call with media on Monday morning to outline the parameters of its looming review of the tournament. \n   \nHowever, Dunbar insisted the process was \"standard practice\". \"We go through a review with all the Wellington stakeholders, the council, with the economic development agency, with the stadium, with Wellington Rugby, who are our partner in the tournament. \n \n\"We'll look at the things that went well, we'll look at the things that we could be improving on and go from there.\" \n \nTWO MORE YEARS? \n \nNew Zealand Rugby still has two years left of a three-year licence with World Rugby to host the sevens, but Dunbar said it was possible the tournament could be moved to another New Zealand centre. \n \n\"World Rugby own the series, they give hosting rights to New Zealand Rugby. New Zealand Rugby, then, make recommendations about what city their tournament is held in. \n \n\"At the end of the day, it's [World Rugby's] decision. They will decide, but things need to work well for them, and their measures are broadcast viewership and sponsorship. \n \n\"It needs to work well for New Zealand Rugby. We have different financial risks, and it needs to work well for the city as well. \n \nROOM FOR OPTIMISM? \n \n\"We will get together with the key Wellington stakeholders within the next two weeks. We'll have to have a chat to World Rugby, we'll have to start to mop up the numbers, and that can take a while, as you'd imagine for a tournament of this size.\" \n \nComment was sought from World Rugby, but Stuff was told nobody was available. \n \nHarmon, however, remained an optimist. \"I still think there's a future for sevens in Wellington. \n \n\"The question is, is there enough interest in sevens rugby in New Zealand?

28 states that legally sells marijuana and you're likely to find products with monikers like God's Green Crack, Super Lemon Haze or Skywalker. That's all about to change as a new breed of \"ganjapreneurs\" swoop into the fledgling industry. In a classic consumer-marketing move, they're getting rid of stoner slang and replacing it with supermarket-friendly names that purport to help customers live better. \n \nTheir message: Weed is no longer just for getting high. It's to help users through stress, ease them into sleep and get them in the mood for love. In other words, these marketers want to transform the image of marijuana so that it competes with scores of products already in liquor stores, markets and pharmacies. \n \n\"I think of our competition not as other edibles,\" says Peter Barsoom, a former Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley manager who's now chief executive officer of 1906, a company that makes cannabis-infused chocolates. \"It's that cup of coffee in the morning, it's the pill of Ambien to help you sleep, it's that cup of chamomile tea,\" he says. \n \nLegal marijuana sales are projected to grow to $18 billion in the next four years from $7 billion, according to Arcview Market Research, and a small group of companies are racing to give legitimacy to their products by adopting segmentation techniques to broaden marijuana's appeal. \n \nThe first step is lowering potency and classifying weed according to specific mood-enhancing qualities. Then it gets down to good-old fashioned brand segmentation. 1906 -- named for the year U.S. statutes first cracked down on marijuana -- is introducing products with names such as Go (an energy booster), Pause (for kicking back), Midnight (a sleep aid), Present (to focus) and High Love (for arousal). \n \nWhether they actually deliver such altered states is almost beside the point. Barsoom's reasoning is that a new generation of consumers will flock to stylish cannabis offerings to deal with life's assorted ailments and annoyances. He's not alone. A host of entrepreneurs and pot businesses also sell mood-tailored products. \n \nLowering the amount of drug per hit, bite or swallow is paramount for appealing to new consumers, according to Mike Ray, a former Wall Street trader and founder of Bloom Farms, which makes pre-filled vape pens and pre-rolled joints. \"I think microdosing is the way of the future.\" \n \nMatt Seashols, for one, was frustrated that he couldn't go to a dispensary in Northern California and get something that would give him a specific feeling without getting so high it would knock him out of commission. So Seashols co-founded hmbldt, named for Humboldt County, the unofficial weed capital of the state. \n \nThe company makes pre-filled vape pens for specific \"need state solutions\": bliss, calm, relief and sleep. Hmbldt also claims to make highs easier to control, by designing its vape pen to vibrate after the user has inhaled 2.25 milligrams of oil. By comparison, most edible products have 5-milligram doses. \n \n\"I wanted to be able to take care of some of these core needs that I had from a quality-of-life perspective through cannabis,\" Seashols says. \"I wanted it to help me sleep better, I wanted it to decrease inflammation, I wanted it to help me relax, as opposed to some ulterior methods, and I couldn't find that.\" \n \nRay's father bought a property called Bloom Farms in Northern California in the 1970s and hosted a hippie commune there. Now, Ray is using the farm's name as the masthead for a new kind of cannabis business -- one that makes products that would fit in at a Whole Foods or a suburban boutique. \n \nThe packaging for its Highlighter, a portable cannabis-oil vapor pen, does not scream stoner. It's made of recycled paper embossed with black writing and an artfully designed marijuana leaf. The oils come with designations such as daytime, nighttime and anytime. \"It's the new cocktail: it's the new ladies' night out,\" Ray says. \n \nSuch talk is part of a necessary shift in brand positioning, 1906's Barsoom says, to make cannabis products more like wine and less like Everclear, the 190-proof grain alcohol brand that has been a staple of frat-party punch bowls for decades. \n \n\"For those who have kids, it gives them a chance after they put the kids to bed to take the chocolate and know they're not going to be blasted,\" Barsoom says. \"Most of us don't have six hours to have a date with an edible.\" \n \nSundayMonday Business on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JENNIFER KAPLAN BLOOMBERG NEWS"},"topics":[{"name":"Illegal drugs news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Marketing news","group":"Business"}],"title":"'Pot' labels, doses get marketing makeover","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200392705","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:52:24Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:59:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

which came undone quickly during a recession, will take time to put together again. \n \nHouseholds continue to embrace thrift even as the ruble tests new highs and inflation at the slowest in history strengthens purchasing power. \n \nWhile unemployment unexpectedly declined in December and real wages surged more than estimated for their fifth monthly gain, retail sales plunged 5.9 percent from a year earlier, the Federal Statistics Service said recently. Their decline for a record 24th month was worse than all but one forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 13 economists, whose median was for a drop of 3.7 percent. \n \nWith the economy on the cusp of recovery after its longest recession in two decades, consumers are reluctant to spend. \n \n\"People are still in crisis deleveraging mode and are acting thrifty, so any additional income isn't spent,\" said Vladimir Osakovskiy, chief economist for Russia at Bank of America in Moscow. \"This supports deposit generation, but at the same time constrains spending.\" \n \nConsumer spending, the main driver of Russia's economic expansion in the past decade, is still so brittle because broader economic gains aren't translating into improvements for the millions of people who bore the brunt of the recession. \n \n\"An increase in poverty is causing a divergence between relatively positive income and unemployment figures and consumption patterns,\" said Natalia Orlova, chief economist at Alfa Bank in Moscow. \n \nReal disposable incomes fell the most in four months, shrinking 6.1 percent in December from a year earlier, according to the statistics service. The median estimate in a Bloomberg poll of nine economists was for a drop of 5.1 percent. \n \nA poll published early last week by the Higher School of Economics showed the financial situation worsened for 39 percent of respondents in the past 12 months and improved for only 9 percent. When asked about the future, 23 percent believe their personal welfare will deteriorate in the coming year, with 11 percent expecting it to get better. \n \n\"The population has already adapted to the new reality: in other words, tightened the belt by cutting spending as much possible,\" Georgy Ostapkovich, head of the Institute for Statistical Studies and Economics of Knowledge that conducted the study, said. \n \nThe savings rate, at 10 percent of disposable incomes in January-November, remains at almost double the ratio in 2008. Still, it has fallen from 14.3 percent in 2015, with the central bank mentioning a decrease in the propensity to save as a threat for its 4 percent inflation target this year. \n \nThe average maximum deposit rate offered by the country's 10 biggest holders of savings fell to 8.29 percent as of Jan. 20, the lowest level since February 2014, according to the central bank. \n \nTo encourage savers, the central bank plans to hold interest rates above inflation. Besides keeping down price pressures, the Bank of Russia is counting on the policy to help transform deposits into investment and ensure healthy growth for the economy. It left the benchmark rate at 10 percent in December, while price growth slowed to 5.4 percent from a year earlier. \n \n\"Consumers became much more cautious and rational,\" said Vladimir Miklashevsky, senior strategist at Danske Bank in Helsinki. \"We don't expect a quick recovery in retail sales as cautiousness will remain, along with a high sensitivity of consumers to prices.\" \n \nSundayMonday Business on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"OLGA TANAS BLOOMBERG NEWS"},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Russian consumers holding back","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200392883","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:45:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:59:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2017/01/27/resized_99261-305964593_1-5_78-22506.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

There was talk about avoiding travel to the United States during Donald Trump's four-year term. And one of the Ashland, Pa.-company's accounts was almost canceled because a customer wanted to boycott American clothes. \n \n\"I felt like the wind got knocked out of me,\" Olberding said from Florence. \"I always thought it was a good thing to keep our production in the U.S., and all of a sudden the conversation changes because of this one person.\" \n \nBy all appearances, Trump should be a boon for the \"Made in USA\" brand. The nation's 45th president swept into office pledging to get American factories humming again. \n \n\"We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American,\" Trump said during his inauguration speech. \n \nBut the negative reaction at Pitti Uomo underscores the pitfalls of these polarizing times. Trump by association can act as a double-edged sword. \n \nA backlash against American brands would be a painful and ironic twist for the apparel and footwear companies that have fought to keep production stateside against innumerable odds. \n \nLong before Trump campaigned on the promise of reviving domestic manufacturing, time-tested labels such as Gitman Bros., Filson and Red Wing Shoes were touting their \"Made in USA\" roots and encouraging customers to buy American menswear at a time when competitors had long fled to cheaper countries. \n \nThey rode a wave of popularity in the aftermath of the 2008 recession as trendsetters began rejecting fast-fashion brands like H&M and embracing traditionally stodgy ones like Brooks Bros. -- an acknowledgment that it was better to buy pieces that lasted than support wasteful fads. With a modern cut and higher prices, the movement essentially made your grandfather's clothes cool, at least among a certain subset of fashion-savvy men. \n \nNow, some of those same companies, as well as more recently established ones, are wondering what the \"Made in USA\" label will mean under the new administration. Will it continue to stand for craftsmanship and style, or amount to an endorsement of Trump's policies -- or even the president himself? \n \n\"Is 'Made in USA' in danger of becoming 'Make Made in USA Great Again'?\" said Jonathan Wilde, editor of GQ.com, a men's fashion bible that has been at the forefront of reviving interest in so-called heritage American brands. \n \nWilde sees a contradiction unfolding. On one hand, U.S. apparel makers could benefit from an administration that favors local producers and makes domestic manufacturing more cost effective. On the other, these brands could lose their cool among their prime demographic if Trump turns \"Made in America\" into a political slogan. \n \nNew Balance, whose retro sneaker designs have enjoyed a popular resurgence, may be the first casualty of this new dynamic. The company, which makes some of its footwear in the United States, found itself at the center of a social media firestorm in November after an executive was quoted in the Wall Street Journal saying the Obama administration \"turned a deaf ear to us\" and that \"things are going to move in the right direction\" under Trump. \n \nCustomers were outraged, pledging a boycott and posting videos of the company's chunky sneakers getting tossed in the trash or set ablaze. White supremacists began claiming New Balance as the shoe brand of white people. The company quickly released a statement saying it did not tolerate bigotry or hate and remained committed to manufacturing in the United States. \n \nA similar controversy befell L.L. Bean this month (albeit without the white supremacists) after Trump tweeted support for the Maine clothing brand, which had landed on a list of companies to boycott because of its ties to the president. Those ties, however, were limited to board member Linda Bean, a Trump donor. In a public statement, the company sought to distance itself from Linda Bean, the granddaughter of L.L. Bean's founder. \n \n\"We are deeply troubled by the portrayal of L.L. Bean as a supporter of any political agenda,\" said the company, which still produces some items such as boots in the United States. \n \nThe recent politicization of fashion labels is the stuff of nightmares for executives like Geoff Clawson, president of Birdwell, a surfwear company that has been manufacturing its signature board shorts in the same Santa Ana, Calif., factory since 1961. \n \nKeeping production in the United States is hard enough without having to worry about how partisan politics can affect the bottom line. Supply chain is a constant concern because the success of Clawson's business is deeply linked to the survival of his nylon supplier in South Carolina and grommet supplier in Florida. \n \n\"It's possible for 'Made in America' to come back, but it will require more of this source material manufacturing to also return to the U.S. and be profitable,\" Clawson said. \"Politics aside, it seems like that's what the president-elect is pointing to. For us to be 'Great Again,' we need to reclaim these disciplines.\" \n \nSundayMonday Business on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"DAVID PIERSON LOS ANGELES TIMES"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Clothiers say politics threaten 'USA' label","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200393224","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:35Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:59:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Now chickens are at the center of a bitter fight between South Africa and Europe. \n \nSouth African farmers and labor unions say the European Union is selling chicken legs, thighs and wings at below cost, threatening local companies and jobs. EU producers make enough money marketing breasts in their home market that dark meat is sold as a waste product, they say. Europe says its farmers are simply more competitive than their peers in South Africa. \n \n\"We definitely have distress,\" South African Trade Minister Rob Davies said last week. \"We will not have an industry to raise the competitiveness of\" if imports continue to flood the market. \n \nThe argument has left South Africa with a tough choice: Either upset relations with its biggest trading partner or watch the demise of its chicken industry, which employs 60,000 people and is the source of 65 percent of all meat consumed in the country. The row marks a rocky start to the European Partnership Agreement, a free trade deal signed last year by the EU and southern African countries including South Africa. \n \n\"We're moving into a more protectionist sort of world,\" said Mike Schussler, chief economist at Johannesburg-based research company Economists.co.za. \"South Africa has one of the most open agricultural markets in the world and seems to be paying the price.\" \n \nEurope's share of South Africa's bone-in chicken imports has grown to 80 percent from 0.5 percent in 2012 when tariffs were removed, according to data compiled by the South African Poultry Association. In contrast, South Africa's biggest chicken producers, including RCL Foods Ltd., are cutting 5,000 jobs and saying the industry is under threat. \n \n\"If things stay the same there will be no chicken industry in a year's time,\" Scott Pitman, managing director of RCL's consumer division, said. \n \nShares of RCL, which produces several food brands other than chicken, are 35 percent below a 20-year high of $1.45 in 2014. \n \n\"The market is looking forward and anticipating lower feed costs\" as South Africa's two-year drought eases, said Victor Dima, a Dubai-based analyst at Arqaam Capital. Chickens in South Africa are fed corn among other feed-stuffs. \n \nSouth Africa is the world's fifth-largest consumer of chicken per capita behind the United States, Australia, Brazil and Peru, according to the International Poultry Council. \n \nThe EU says its chicken exports comply with trade laws and there's no reason for South Africa to impose duties against them. The accusation of dumping is a sensitive one for the EU, given that the bloc last year imposed tariffs as high as 73.7 percent on Chinese steel that it says is dumped in Europe. \n \n\"The real problems of the South African poultry industry are not so much caused by the imports from the EU but that it is suffering from structural problems affecting its competitiveness,\" Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU's trade commissioner, said in a Jan. 11 letter to South African Minister of Trade Rob Davies. \n \nDavies agrees that producers must find ways of raising efficiency. \"But they're not going to be solved if we just allow an influx of spare parts from around the world to come in to take over the market,\" he said. \n \nFrozen leg quarters imported to South Africa from Europe cost $2.80 per pound before duties and storage this month, about 30 percent cheaper than local producers, according to Astral Foods Ltd. \n \nThat rankles local producers who say their production costs for whole birds are lower than European farmers'. Researchers at Pretoria-based Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy and the Netherlands' Wageningen University found that South Africa's whole-chicken costs were about 20 percent lower than in Europe in 2013, the latest available data. \n \nEuropean farmers reject accusations of dumping. South African producers inject chickens with brine, or salt water, increasing their weight and reducing quality, said Cees Vermeeren, secretary-general of AVEC, a trade body for European chicken farmers. \n \nStill, South Africa's chicken producers are asking the government to increase protection from European imports. \n \nSouth Africa's government imposed anti-dumping tariffs ranging from 4 percent to 73 percent on some chicken from Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K. in 2015. In December it added a temporary 13.9 percent \"safeguard duty\" while it investigates allegations of dumping. \n \n\"Chicken farming is in crisis and on the cusp of collapse,\" Kevin Lovell, chief executive officer of SAPA, said. \"The trigger will be when the banks stop funding. That moment is getting close. Then the industry will shrink permanently.\" \n \nSundayMonday Business on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"KEVIN CROWLEY AND THOMAS SEAL BLOOMBERG NEWS"},"topics":[{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"South Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"European Union news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Feathers ruffled in S.

A constituency that has more bark than bite, more meow than scratch, if you will. \n \nPetCoach's goal is to become the go-to source for pet care. \n \n\"At the end of the day, I want to transform the pet-health industry,\" said Brock Weatherup, chief executive officer and co-founder of PetCoach, himself an impressive breed of serial entrepreneur. \n \nRight now, the company, based in suburban Philadelphia, operates PetCoach.co, a technology and health-care platform attracting 150,000 visitors and 13,000 questions a month and growing. The site offers personalized answers to questions, articles and educational information, and access to experts, including veterinarians, pet nutritionists and trainers. The philosophy behind the business model is that getting more pet owners to ask more questions will lead to healthier happier, and preferably longer lives for pets -- and more confident owners. \n \nLaunched in 2014, PetCoach was bought by Weatherup in July from founder David Martin, a native of Madrid, now a resident of the Philadelphia region, who continues with the company as chief digital officer, one of 10 employees. They met through a mutual contact when PetCoach was enrolled in a DreamIt accelerator in Austin, Texas, and Weatherup was CEO of Pet360 and mentoring a DreamIt company in Philadelphia. \n \nWhen PetCoach left DreamIt, Weatherup recruited it, giving it office space and valuable insight on the pet industry. At the time, PetCoach's strength was technology. \n \nThey're a long way from knowing whether PetCoach will become the kind of blockbuster endeavor Weatherup's last one became -- a rebranding and scaling that led to the sale of Pet360.com to PetSmart for $160 million in fall 2014. \n \nIn November, PetCoach announced that it had raised $2 million in seed funding, led by Comcast Ventures, a private venture-capital affiliate of Comcast Corp. Maveron, a consumer-only venture-capital firm based in Seattle and San Francisco, also put up money, along with DreamIt Ventures. \n \n\"I was surprised and frankly humbled by their response,\" said Weatherup, 45. \"I've raised money around ideas when there was a highly defined business with lots of metrics, like Pet360. In this case, it was more theory around an idea. I've never done that.\" \n \nThough there are a variety of online sites offering information on pets and pet-related services, such as mobile vets and equipment enabling vets to consult with customers via phone and internet, nobody was bringing it all together or providing customized answers to questions. Growth potential is especially strong for exotics: birds, reptiles, rodents, rabbits. \n \n\"If you're not involved across the board, you don't own the trust of the consumer,\" said Weatherup, who also is president of Philly Startup Leaders, a support group for early-stage companies. \n \nIn funding such young businesses, the selling point for investors is often \"about the team, secondarily about the market,\" said Sam Landman, managing director at Comcast Ventures. He identified Weatherup as a primary reason for his firm's investment, the amount of which he would not reveal as a matter of policy. \n \n\"I've been building a relationship with Brock six or seven years, and I've come to believe he's an extraordinary entrepreneur by any standard -- New York, Silicon Valley, certainly a special entrepreneur in the Philadelphia region,\" Landman said. \n \nWeatherup's pet-industry expertise was a big draw, too, Landman said, calling it \"a very large market that has not evolved significantly over the many decades I have been a pet owner. Not only is it a very large market, but I think the experience for the pet owner and the pet is suboptimal.\" \n \nLandman said his 8-year-old golden retriever, Jackson, has \"gone to the vet enough times he knows he doesn't like it. And so, to the extent you could deliver excellent care in the home, not only is it less stressful for the pet, it's also less stressful and more convenient for the pet owner.\" \n \nBeing a source for in-home care is among the additional services PetCoach plans to provide. Weatherup did not want to reveal other considerations, but made a point of saying vets should not feel threatened by PetCoach. Getting pet owners to ask more questions will drive more people to seek a vet's help, he maintains. PetCoach.co offers help in finding vets. \n \n\"I think the veterinary community is split on whether telemedicine is a good thing or not,\" said Len Donato, a veterinarian at Radnor Veterinary Hospital who has been in practice 20 years. \"I do not feel threatened by it. This would only augment what I'm doing.\" \n \nHe doesn't expect it to reduce the times he treats Weatherup's 5-year-old English retriever, Boulder. \n \n\"I don't typically hear from Brock,\" Donato said. \"His sister is a veterinarian. He just texts her, probably.\" \n \nWeatherup said he also calls. \n \nSundayMonday Business on 01/29/2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"DIANE MASTRULL THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER"},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer: pets news","group":"Lifestyle"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"Entrepreneur news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Startup entrepreneur's firm offers information on pet care","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"72765","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Springdale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North West Arkansas Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669649","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"938"},"name":"North West Arkansas Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nwaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200393861","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:18Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:59:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Sidharth will be a part of the remake version of Yash Chopra\u2019s murder mystery \u201cIttefaq\u201d to be jointly produced by Red Chillies Entertainment, Dharma Production and BR Films. \u201cIt is an adaptation and not a direct remake of \u2018Ittefaq\u2019. There are changes made to the story so it reduces the pressure of filling in the shoes of the mega and huge superstar like Rajesh Khanna Ji,\u201d Sidharth told PTI. The actor says he is a huge fan of the yesteryear actor and picked \u201cAnand\u201d as his favourite from the pack of superhits delivered by Khanna. \u201cI am very excited about doing this film. I am a big fan of him and his films. One film of his that I have liked the most is \u2018Anand\u2019.\u201d The 32-year-old star says that though murder mystery thrillers are quite a rage in the West, not enough films have been made in the genre in Bollywood. \u201cIt is a genre one hasn\u2019t seen in a while. I haven\u2019t done murder mystery so I am looking forward to it,\u201d he said. Beside Sidharth, the film will star Sonakshi Sinha and the shooting will begin in Mumbai from next month.

The U.S. is Britain\u2019s biggest national trading partner. \n   \nIn the meantime, various measures are being considered, including mutual recognition of qualifications, removal of mobile-phone roaming charges, and elimination of blocks on the trade of some agricultural goods, according to an official who asked not to be identified before a formal announcement. \n   \n\u201cThis is the first step leading to a future trade deal with the U.S. which could provide huge benefits to our economic muscle and will give businesses additional certainty and confidence,\u201d May said in a statement. \n   \nThe U.S. receives 47.3 billion pounds ($59.4 billion) of U.K. goods a year, exceeding Britain\u2019s next largest partner, Germany, by almost 17 billion pounds, according to a U.K. government report. \n     \nThe U.S. and U.K. will establish joint working groups to scope out what can be achieved before Brexit.

And if I had a chance to do it all over again, I would do the same thing.\u201d\n\nCompleting a race against an international field for the first time since her testimony helped expose Russia\u2019s vast doping machinery, Stepanova finished last in the 800 meters before a full house at the Reggie Lewis Center in Boston.\n\nStill, it was race winner Charlene Lipsey, from LSU and Hempstead, New York, who congratulated Stepanova after the race and thanked her for exposing the depths of performance-enhancing drug use in the Russian track and field machinery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal that some of the athletes, they like what I did, they come up to me and thank me,\u201d Stepanova said. \u201cBut some of the others, they hate me.\u201d\n\nAsked what she thinks about those who are angry at her, Stepanova said: \u201cI don\u2019t just think so, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nDoping?\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter receiving a suspension in 2013 because of abnormalities in her biological passport, Stepanova and her husband, Vitaly Stepanov, provided evidence to the World Anti-Doping Agency of systematic cheating in Russian sports. Her testimony played a central role in the IAAF\u2019s decision to suspend Russia\u2019s track and field federation from global competition and exclude all but one member of its team from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in August.\n\nStepanova was cleared to return for the European Championships in August, but she popped a tendon in her foot during the race and did not finish.

She said she is not interested in seeking U.S. citizenship and competing as an American.\n\n\u201cI enjoy being a neutral athlete because I don\u2019t have any pressure and I don\u2019t have to deliver medals to anyone,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked if she would ever run under the Russian flag again, she said, \u201cIf you asked me that question a year ago, \u2018Yes.\u2019 I would have loved to compete for Russia again.\n\n\u201cAt this point, I\u2019ve changed my mind _ and they don\u2019t want me back, either,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought the attitude in Russia would change and they would look at me as I was trying to help the sport and I was trying to help the athletes.

This means that the deeper darker purple foods have a higher content of antioxidants and nutrition. \n \nAccording to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), people who eat purple and blue food have a reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, which is a precursor for Type 2 Diabetes. Plus they have lower blood pressure and smaller waist circumferences. \n \nStudies have shown the many health benefits of purple foods, these include: \n Helping fight cancer  \nResveratrol \u2013 a type of natural phenol \u2013 is present in purple grapes, blueberries and even red wine, and has shown promising results in studies which have helped induce cancer cell death.   \n Helping fight obesity  \nStudies have shown that high levels of anthocyanins in purple foods such as purple sweet potatoes are imperative in helping control levels of leptin \u2013 otherwise dubbed the \u2018Obesity hormone\u2019.   \n Reducing damage to the liver  \nAnthocyanins found in purple foods have been known to reduce damage to the liver, which can be caused by a variety of reasons.   \n You might also like: Myths and misconceptions about obesity  Improving heart health  \nAnthocyanins can help play a pivotal role in protecting the heart muscle from oxidative damage.

Furthermore, purple cabbage also contains high levels of vitamin A which is imperative in supporting the body\u2019s immune response. \n \n\n Purple Potatoes  \nSweet potatoes are supplied in a variety of colours which contain vitamin A, vitamin C and manganese. However the deeper the colours (purples, reds), the more antioxidants it contains \u2013 so take note of the colour before buying. \n Purple Carrots  \nPurple carrots contain high levels of vitamin A, (which is also found in ordinary carrots); however, they also contain high levels of anthocyanins which possess a vast amount of health benefits, (as listed above). \n \n\n You might also like: 9 ways to banish belly fat  Beetroot  \nBeetroots are high in vitamin C, which is essential in helping maintain a good, strong and healthy immune system.

With a considerable amount of iron and vitamin E, black rice is known to contain anti-ageing elements and improve heart health. \n \n\n How to eat more purple foods in your diet  Choose black grapes rather than green grapes for a handy snack.  Add aubergine to the meat mixture for lasagne.  Use beetroot in salads and sandwiches.  In your smoothie whizz up blueberries, blackberries and beetroot for the ultimate in purple foods. Remember that when you\u2019re making smoothies it\u2019s advised to use vegetables too, only using fruit ensures there\u2019s lots of natural sugars and very little fibre.

At that point, Ward said the NFL wasn\u2019t really on anyone\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cHe was always our best player, but nobody really thought he would be in the NFL,\u201d \n\nThe two continued their strong relationship after Juszczyk accepted a scholarship to Harvard. Over the next few years, Ward attended a couple of Harvard-Yale games and watched as Juszczyk developed into an NFL prospect. As a senior, Juszczyk was a unanimous first-team All-Ivy League selection as a tight end. The Ravens drafted him in the fourth round of the 2013 NFL Draft. Juszczyk slid into a starting fullback role before his second season and has been a mainstay in the Ravens lineup ever since.\n\nThis season, Juszczyk led all fullbacks with 266 receiving yards on 37 receptions, while also rushing for 22 yards on five carries.\n\n\u201cKyle has put in a ton of hard work to get himself to this point he kept improving each year from high school onward,\u201d \n\nThese days, Ward is retired and lives in Cuyahoga Falls. He remains in close contact with Juszczyk. The two text every Friday during the season and Ward watches the Ravens on TV every week.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk, it\u2019s usually about subjects other than football,\u201d \n\nWard retired from Cloverleaf feeling very fulfilled not only from his relationship with Juszczyk, but also with the dozens of other players he has worked with over the years. He views this weekend as a celebration of all the special bonds that come about due to football.\n\n\u201cSo many of these individuals don\u2019t take credit for what they do, they do it because its the right thing,\u201d \n\nSTRUTHERS \u2014 Struthers took down Western Reserve 64-59 on Saturday.

Government is contemplating to make Aadhaar or Unique Identification (UID) card mandatory to avail rail concession, and an announcement is likely to be made by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley while presenting the first combined General and Railway Budget on February 1. The move will help the government in better targetting of benefits and check misuse of the facility, sources said. The Railways provides concession on tickets to more than 50 categories of passengers which include senior citizens, students, research scholars, teacher, doctor, nurse, patients, sports people, unemployed youth, Arjun awardees among others. At present, Railways is running a pilot project for senior citizens who are entitled for rail concessions. The concessional tickets cost the Railways about Rs 1,600 crore in 2015-16, with the bulk being accounted for senior citizens.\n\nAs per the government data, over 100 crore Aadhaar cards have been issued so for covering bulk of India\u2019s population. The government has decided to end the 92-year-old practice of presenting a separate Railway budget and merged it with the General Budget. Jaitley, according to sources, will contribute few pages of his Budget to programmes and schemes related to Indian Railways. Although there will be a single budget, the Railways will continue to have autonomy as commercial undertaking and the existing financial arrangement will remain.\n\nThe Railways is expected to get exemption from payment of dividend to the Union government, a move which will help strengthening its finances. The organisation will also get budget support to meet part of its capital expenditure and will be allowed to raise extra budgetary resources.

New coach Bruce Arena\u2019s MLS-based player group is clearly optimistic about the tests ahead, but the U.S. needs immediate improvements after two losses late last year put the Americans at the bottom of their World Cup qualifying group. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a new vibe,\u201d Feilhaber said. \u201cIt\u2019s been great. Everybody is fighting for positions, but united in the knowledge that we need to do something special this year in qualifying, and it starts in this camp.\u201d \n \nFeilhaber is an offensive midfielder who could provide a dimension that seemed lacking in the Americans\u2019 attack in recent months. He is just one of several players getting newfound looks and increased attention after fading from Klinsmann\u2019s favor. \n \nDax McCarty, Chris Pontius and Chad Marshall also might have thought they were all done with U.S. national team play after getting passed over by the German coach. Other younger MLS-based players, including Sebastian Lletget and Walker Zimmerman, still hadn\u2019t attracted Klinsmann\u2019s serious attention. \n \nWhen Klinsmann was fired and Arena took over late last year, the veterans had already made their usual January vacation plans \u2014 and McCarty even scheduled his wedding this month. \n \nThey all reported to Carson for the start of another run under Arena, who has been determined to keep an open mind about anyone who could help his team. \n \n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to prove anything extra,\u201d Arena said of the second-chance contingent. \u201cBut they\u2019ve demonstrated they\u2019re good players, and they\u2019ve convinced me that they\u2019re options. At the end of the day, we\u2019ve got to compile all of this stuff after this camp and then look at our pool of players that are in Europe as well as in Mexico and try to see what makes sense for the games in March. It\u2019s not going to be an easy exercise, for sure.\u201d \n \n \nThe match in San Diego is Arena\u2019s first for the U.S. team since June 22, 2006, when the Americans were eliminated from the World Cup with a 2-1 loss to Ghana at Nuremberg. After his first U.S. tenure ended, Arena moved on to build the LA Galaxy into a three-time MLS champion. \n \nFrom veteran Jermaine Jones to youngster Jordan Morris, the MLS-based players appear to appreciate Arena\u2019s confident style of management \u2014 while realizing the results will determine his real success. \n \n\u201cBruce is very open with his players,\u201d Feilhaber said. \u201cHe lets you know exactly what he expects from you, and he\u2019s been very clear with me what position he would like me to play in, and what my responsibilities would be for the team. It\u2019s very straightforward and easy to grasp what my job is. It\u2019s been very few surprises.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Greg Beacham The"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Benny Feilhaber gets second chance with U.S. soccer under Bruce Arena","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"90503","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Torrance","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Breeze","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169676533","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"296"},"name":"Daily Breeze","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailybreeze.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200420530","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.dailybreeze.com/storyimage/LI/20170128/SPORTS/170129414/AR/0/AR-170129414.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Keeping up with changes to the U.S. tax code could add to your stress. \n \nUnfortunately, these changes aren't the only things that we need to worry about. This time of year also brings out an abundance of scammers. \n \nSeniors especially need to be wary of tax scams. The National Council on Aging said that those 65 and older are at the most risk of falling victim to a financial scam. One reason for this is seniors typically have more expendable money than other age groups. \n \nEven though seniors are targeted at a higher rate, everyone needs to be on the lookout for tax scams. \n Fake IRS agent phone scam  \nThe most common tax scam for years has been conducted over the telephone. A victim will receive a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS. The fake IRS agent acts very aggressive and tells the victim they owe past taxes and fees that are due immediately. \n \nMany times the victim is told an arrest warrant is going to be issued if they don't pay ASAP. They are told to send money via wire transfer or prepaid debit card. \n \nThe IRS has compiled a list of things to watch out for that will tip off the call is a scam. Here are five things the IRS will never do: \n Call to demand immediate payment, nor will they call about taxes owed without first having mailed you a bill.  Demand that you pay taxes without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount they say you owe.  Require you to use a specific payment method for your taxes, such as a prepaid debit card.  Ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone.  Threaten to bring in local police or other law-enforcement groups to have you arrested for not paying.  \nIf you receive a call claiming to be from the IRS and hear any of the things on this list, here's what you need to do: \n If you know you owe taxes or think you might owe, call the IRS at 1-800-829-1040. IRS workers can help you with a payment issue.  If you know you don't owe taxes or have no reason to believe that you do, report the incident to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration at 1-800-366-4484 or at www.tigta.gov .  You can file a complaint using the FTC Complaint Assistant : choose \"Other\" and then \"Impostor Scams.\" If the complaint involves someone impersonating the IRS, include the words \"IRS Telephone Scam\" in the notes.  \nAlso, the IRS does not use unsolicited email, text messages or any social media to discuss your personal tax issue. For more information on reporting tax scams, go to www.irs.gov and type \"scam\" in the search box. \n More stories you can't miss:  \n7 ways to find unclaimed money \n \n5 best streaming gadgets \n \nRansomware infected app hitting smartphones now! \n  \nPlease share this information with everyone.

We saw the arrival of classic films and all-time favorites plus original Netflix programs we enjoyed through and through. \n \nNow that February is upon us, it's looking like another excellent batch of movies, TV shows, and original Netflix programming is coming our way.  It even includes a recent Pixar blockbuster that both kids and the kid-at-heart will surely enjoy! \n Contact  \n[embedded content] \n \n\"Contact\" is one of the most thought-provoking sci-fi movies of all time and it's coming back to Netflix on February 1. Based off a Carl Sagan novel, it raises questions about faith, spirituality, science and extra-terrestrial encounters. \n \nIf you haven't seen this classic before, now is your chance. \"Contact\" stars Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey with Robert Zemeckis as director. \n American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson  \n[embedded content] \n \nThe critically acclaimed FX series \"American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson\" is coming to Netflix on February 2. \n \nThis series is an incisive reenactment of O.J. Simpson's murder trial and is based off the book \"The Run of His Life: The People v. O.J. Simpson.\" It delves deeper into the backroom dealings and maneuverings of both defense and prosecution and how these affected the trial itself. \n \n\"American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson\" stars Cuba Gooding Jr. (as O.J. Simpson), John Travolta, David Schwimmer and Sarah Paulson. \n Finding Dory  \n[embedded content] \n \nWith Netflix scoring an exclusive streaming deal with Disney, the latest hits from the House of Mouse just keep coming. \n \nFebruary's Disney treat will be last year's animated blockbuster \"Finding Dory.\" This is the sequel to another Pixar smash hit, 2003's \"Finding Nemo.\" This time, it tells the journey of one of \"Finding Nemo's\" side characters, the forgetful fish Dory, as she searches for her long-lost parents. \n \nThis is a Netflix flick the whole family will surely enjoy. It arrives on February 1. \n Santa Clarita  \n[embedded content] \n \nThere's a slew of Netflix originals coming in February but this is the most interesting of the bunch. \n \n\"Santa Clarita Diet\" is a comedy-horror Netflix series starring Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant. They play a married couple of real estate agents whose lives take an interesting turn when the wife dies and turns into a flesh eating zombie. \n \nBased on the trailers, this will be a disturbing but fun genre mashup of a series. \"Santa Clarita Diet\" comes to life on February 3. \n \nOther additions worth mentioning are Tim Burton's \"Corpse Bride\" and \"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\" the popular Channing Tatum hit \"Magic Mike,\" Seth Rogen's R-Rated animated comedy \"Sausage Party\" and the \"Babe\" movies. February 7 also marks the debut of Netflix's Valentine's Day special, \"Michael Bolton\u2019s Big, Sexy Valentine\u2019s Day Special.\" \n \nAnd as usual, as new content comes, we'll have to say goodbye to other favorites as well. Thankfully, the departure list is not as extensive. Among the notable movies saying goodbye are \"There Will Be Blood,\" \"The Kite Runner,\" \"The Machinist,\" \"Mission Impossible 3,\" and \"Trainspotting.\" If you haven't seen these before, make sure you catch them before they leave Netflix next month. \n \nFor the full list, proceed to the next page. \n Next page: Click next for the full list          \nPrevious Happening Now  Top Story: Tax scams preying on senior citizens - Warn your loved ones!  \n     \nRandom Happening Now  10 flawless pictures from the 10 most popular Instagram accounts","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Francis Navarro"},"topics":[{"name":"Movie business news","group":"Media"},{"name":"Digital distribution news","group":"Internet"}],"title":"What\u2019s in and out of Netflix in February","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Maricopa","zipCode":"85008","state":"Arizona","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Phoenix","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kim Komando","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170292360","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"455"},"name":"Kim Komando","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.komando.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200430419","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.komando.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Finding-Dory-1-148x148.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Father. He who is surrounded by his enemies (Fulani herdsmen and Boko Haram) is always alert. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the latest way forward.\u201d \n\nOther Facebook users praised the priest for arming himself. \n\nOne Ayalogu Emmanuel called for the enactment of a law allowing civilians to use heavy firearms. \n\n\u201cPlease, how can I get my own AK-47 rifle? The National Assembly should be thinking of passing a bill to legalise the use of machine guns,\u201d he said. \n\nAnother commenter, Meg Barn, said it would be a good idea to not only arm church priests but also the parishioners. \n\n\u201cWatch and pray; they (religious leaders) should arm their parishioners too. There is no church without the laity,\u201d she said. \n\nCommending the priest in the picture, a Facebook user, Achukwu Achike, also said, \u201cVery good; God help those who help themselves.\u201d \n\nIgwe Murphy Okwudili, stated, \u201cThat will deter them (herdsmen) from constantly invading people\u2019s lands and property.\u201d \n\nBut another user of the social media platform, Halliday Charles, said, \u201cGod doesn\u2019t help those who help or can help themselves. God helps the helpless; God defends the defenceless. The strength of God is made perfect in our weakness.\u201d \n\nIn August last year, a Catholic seminarian, Lazarus Nwafor, was killed during the invasion of Attakwu community by armed herdsmen. \n\nThe seminarian was murdered during an early morning attack on the community, which is located in Nkanu West Local Government Area of Enugu State.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Mandy Oteng"},"topics":[{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Picture of the day: Reverend father in church with rifle","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Online Nigeria News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"556500462","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Online Nigeria News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://news2.onlinenigeria.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200433188","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It is regrettable that during the ambush and exchange of gunfire between military escorts and the terrorists, many passengers took to their heels into the bush, and most of them fell victim in the cross fire.. \n \n\u201cI cannot ascertain the number of those killed as I managed to escape with my passengers. But I learnt that scores of people were killed or injured.\u201d \n[embedded content] \nREAD ALSO: Catholic priest kidnapped in Delta state, N10m ransom demanded \n \nThe Borno State Police Command has yet to confirm the attack neither have military authorities issued any statement on the attack. \n \nMeanwhile, statistics have shown that January 2017 has been full of deaths for Nigerians. \n \nWhile it is true that people die daily, the deaths recorded below occurred on a scale that affected the country as a whole. \n   \nThink it is important?

It is a day to remember after dare devil hoodlums stormed the High Court premises in the town and rescued one of their own, Henry Chibueze, alias Vampire! \n\nMoreso Governor Rochas Okorocha had offered N5 million bounty to anybody that could give credible information capable of leading to the re-arrest of the fleeing Vampire. \n\n\u2018Vampire\u2019 and other inmates \n\nVampire, described as a native of Nwangele local council area of Imo State, had been on the wanted list of the police and the Department of State Security, DSS, before he was apprehended. \n\nHe was wanted  for crimes, including armed robbery and kidnapping. The state heaved a sigh of relief when the DSS announced his capture in far away Ohafia, Abia State and  paraded him before journalists. After concluding their investigation, the police arraigned him in court and he was remanded in prison custody. \n\nLast Friday was therefore scheduled for the continuation of the hearing of the case and it was the responsibility of Imo State Command of the Nigeria Prison Service, NPS, to produce the suspect in court. \n\nFor the law abiding citizens at the High Court premises, it was business as usual. \n\nMeanwhile, a Sports Utility Vehicle, SUV, drove into the premises while armed occupants waited  patiently for their target. \n\nSunday Vanguard gathered that the scenario changed when the NPS Black Maria conveying over 50 inmates from Owerri prisons arrived. \n\nThe hoodlums attacked the Black Maria as soon as it parked in the court premises. \n\nSix persons, including prison officials and inmates, were critically wounded, even as two were feared dead. \n\nA lawyer at the scene as the hoodlums attacked, said the gangsters were fully prepared for the onslaught. \n\n\u201cThe gangsters were fully prepared for the mission to rescue their man, Vampire. \n\nContinuing, the legal practitioner said that there was total confusion in the court premises as the hoodlums fired sporadically from virtually all corners. \n\n\u201cPeople scampered into safety. Some of the accused persons equally ran  for their dear lives. I ran into the female toilet in the Bar Centre\u201d, the lawyer said. \n\nOne of the litigants present at the scene, whose entire body shook as he spoke with Sunday Vanguard, described the scenario as \u201cakin to what we see in movies\u201d. \n\n\u201cThe attack brought activities in the court premises to abrupt end. The armed men\u2019s mission was to rescue one of their own\u201d, the litigant stated. \n\n\u201cThe sorry thing is that the armoured vehicle which was stationed at the entrance of the court remained silent and unmoved throughout the operation\u201d. \n\nSimilarly, a judiciary staff, who also spoke on the condition of confidentiality, lamented that the hoodlums gained entrance into the premises and operated without inhibition. \n\n\u201cThere is no way I can explain the commando-like incident to the outside world. The booming sound of guns and their operational finesse proved that they were not amateurs in the game\u201d, the judicial staff said. \n\nMeanwhile, some of the suspects being conveyed in the ill-fated Black Maria, who felt that they had good cases, ended their search for safety in nearby Government House, and were later handed over to prison authorities. \n\nWhen contacted, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Taiwo Lakanu, confirmed the incident but explained that it was the headache of the state Prison Command. \n\nThe Public Relations Officer, PRO, of the Imo State Command of the NPS, Mr. James Maduba, equally confirmed the attack. \n\nMaduba also confirmed that Vampire \u201chas escaped from lawful custody\u201d, while six people were critically wounded during the ugly operation\u201d. \n\nThe PRO said the Command had received a call earlier in the day that some armed men were seen in the High Court premises. \n\n\u201cWe thought that they were operatives of the DSS.  As we were conveying over 50 inmates to the court, the gunmen attacked our men and some of the inmates\u201d, Maduba said. \n\nThe prisons image maker also disclosed that the critically wounded officials and inmates had been taken to hospital for treatment. \n\n\u201cMy Comptroller and other security chiefs in the state are on top of the situation\u201d, Maduba assured.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Larry Nwabuoku 8 hours"},"topics":[],"title":"Okorocha places N5m bounty on attackers Owerri High Court","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Online Nigeria News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"556500462","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Online Nigeria News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://news2.onlinenigeria.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200438459","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T23:12:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Nyesom Wike of Rivers has stated that the two seized helicopters by the Nigerian Customs Service belong to the Rivers state government and that he officially wrote to President Muhammadu Buhari asking him to hand over the two armoured helicopters  to Nigeria Air Force (NAF). \n\nThe governor\u2019s claim contradicts the claim of NCS that the owner of the aircraft was not known. \n\nWike, in a statement issued by his spokesman, Simeon Nwakaudu, in Port Harcourt on Saturday, said he wrote the president because of high custom duties and refusal of the Federal Government to grant waiver on the helicopters. \n\nHe said, \u201cthese helicopters were imported by the immediate past administration; and when I assumed office, we wrote to the Federal Government that the helicopters were strictly for security use. \n\n\u201cI went to the Federal Government to give me waiver for us to clear the helicopters but they refused. \n\n\u201cThereafter, I wrote to President Buhari to assure him that the helicopters are meant for security purpose and that it should be handed over to the Nigeria Air Force. \n\n\u201cWe stated that we cannot pay the custom duties because the helicopters are not for commercial use; but to monitor the creeks and track criminals. \n\n\u201cIn any case, where will the Rivers Government get money at this time to import armoured helicopters to which the previous administration imported because it had money (at the time). \n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised that they have started propaganda and political falsehood on the said armoured helicopters. \n\n\u201cWhat am I going to use armoured helicopters for; what kind of country are they turning Nigeria into?\u201d he asked. \n\nWike said it was unfortunate that some security agencies would allegedly resort to political propaganda and outright lies when facts of the seized armoured helicopters were known. \n\nHe said it was shocking that NCS would turn around to claim that it impounded the helicopters rather than telling the truth. \n\nWike claimed that the chief of staff to the president commended the Rivers government when the letter was delivered to the president. \n\nOn Friday, the Murtala Muhammed International Airport Command of NCS handed over two civil model Bell helicopters imported into the country by unknown persons to the NAF. \n\nThe Service said the aircraft were seized on Nov. 7 2016. \n\nIt explained that the aircraft were handed over to NAF because of the failure of the yet-to-be-identified importers to produce end user certificate from the office of the National Security Adviser. \n\nThe Customs said the action contravened the Customs and Excise Management Act.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Larry Nwabuoku 10 hours"},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Seized helicopters belong to Rivers Govt \u2013 Wike","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Online Nigeria News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"556500462","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Online Nigeria News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://news2.onlinenigeria.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200438883","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T21:20:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Nze Chidi Duru, for alleged theft, impersonation, conspiracy and breach of the peace. \n\nAt the commencement of trial on the 16th of January 2017, before a Chief Magistrate Court in Lagos, the police alleged: \u201cChidi Duru \u2018M\u2019,  Smart Iheazor \u2018M\u2019 and others now at large, on the 11th day of January 2017, at No. 65 Kudirat Abiola Way, Oregun, Ikeja, Lagos, in the Lagos Magistrate District, did conspire among  yourselves to commit felony to wit stealing and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 409 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State of Nigeria, 2011\u2033. \n\nAlso, they, according to the charge sheet, alleged that the suspect, alongside others at large \u201cdid steal (3) three office files, (1) one HP Laptop valued at the sum of N250,000 property  of First Guarantee Pension Limited (FGPL)\u201d, contrary to contrary to Section 285 of Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2011\u2033;  and conducted themselves \u201cin a manner likely to cause breach of the peace by wilfully and unlawfully invading First Guarantee Pension Limited (FGPL) offices with an intent to forcefully takeover the management and assets of the company and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 111(d) of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2011\u201d. \n\nOne of the other suspects at large, Mr. Osita Osuagwu, was arrested and arraigned on the same charges on the 18th of January 2017. \n\nThis is the sort of utmost seriousness and professionalism with which issues relating to the protection of pension assets should be treated. After all, we will all become pensioners someday. \n\nThe claim by Duru that he had gone to FGPL to enforce a court order holds no water. While he claims he has a purported court order restraining the National Pension Commission (PENCOM) from acting on the reports of the regular and special examinations on FGPL in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, which allegedly indicted him, he does not tell people there was another court order in favour of PENCOM, while suits relating to the matter, including an appeal by himself, are before the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court. So the issue of disobeying court order does not arise. \n\nBesides, disobedience to court order is a contempt of court and the court knows how to enforce sanctions against a party that acts in contempt to it. So, why hasn\u2019t the court taken action against the said disobedience since 2011 if any such contempt exists? \n\nAlso, Duru does not tell Nigerians that the accounts of FGPL account was in red to the tune of N422,958,000 as of the time he was eased out as the Vice Chairman of the Board of FGPL in August 2011 for alleged practices and constant corporate governance practices, recorded a profit of N1,922,390,000 as at April 2016. \n\nOne must, therefore, commend the police for refusing to fall for  Duru\u2019s claims to the effect that he had a court order to take over the management of the PFA. Besides his inability to provide the much touted purported court order, the police was on point to have reasoned that it was not in Duru\u2019s place to enforce any court order, even if there was any. It was for the court bailiff, working with the police. \n\nThe police were also right in their refusal to fall for the alleged claim by the former lawmaker that he had President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s nod, vide the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), to take over FGPL. How could The Presidency have asked Duru to go and act in contempt of court upon a matter before the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal? But it is reassuring to know that the police was able to confirm that neither President Buhari nor the AGF gave any such directive. \n\nPolice also deserves a pat on the back for refusing to fall for Duru\u2019s claim of \u201csudden illness\u201d while in police custody. We can only make progress in this country once the law is equally applied and without undue privileges to the rich and powerful. We would never make any headway if, as Jonathan Swift put it, laws are rendered mere \u201ccobwebs, which may catch small flies, but let wasps and hornets break through\u201d. \n\nIs it not an irony that he was full of life when he allegedly invaded the head office of FGPL for which he has now been charged, only for him to suddenly take ill in police cell as widely reported by the media. But thank God for the police hospital, which ensured he regained his \u2018failing health\u2019 and he was arraigned. \n\nHowever, for the police and the judiciary to earn the full praise of pensioners, Nigerian workers, and the public on this matter, they should ensure that this matter does not end with the razzmatazz of arraignment as we have seen with cases of corruption involving VIPs. The usual long and windy trial should not apply here if we must ensure justice for all the parties. \n\nDipo Ogunlolu resides in Lagos.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Larry Nwabuoku 8 hours"},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Between Chidi Duru and the police","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Online Nigeria News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"556500462","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Online Nigeria News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://news2.onlinenigeria.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200439414","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T23:23:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The feud between the embattled chief and the palace of the Oba of Benin, Omo N\u2019Oba N\u2019Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Oba Ewuare 11 (Ogidigan), climaxed on Wednesday when top Benin chiefs invaded the palace of Isekhure, located along Sakpoba Road Benin City, allegedly to secure the Erimwi-Idu shrine, belonging to the Oba, and, in the process, destroyed every item that gave the place the semblance of a palace  including the status of Isekhure erected in the palace several years ago. \n\nThe blow dealt on  Isekhure is a pointer that this Oba will not tolerate any attempt by any of his chiefs to take for granted the monarchical rules of the kingdom. The chief priest of the Oba  was alleged to have failed to perform his duties when Oba Erediauwa joined his ancestors and even when Oba Ewuare 11 ascended the throne last year. \n\nThe Iyase of Benin, who announced Isekhure\u2019s suspension, last week, after pronouncing the allegations against the chief priest, narrated the history of the Ihogbe family and cited reasons the rituals usually performed by the Isekhure on behalf of the Oba was returned to the Ihama who, according to him, is the original performer of those rituals. \n\nHe said, \u201cThe Isekhure of Benin is a member of the Ihogbe Palace Society of Benin, the leader of which is the Ihama of Benin. Ihama was one of the traditional spiritual personages who travelled with Prince Oranmiyan from Ife to Benin City in about the middle of the twelfth century AD.   Isekhurhe was, as the family grew in Benin, one of his male children. \n\nThe present responsibilities of Isekhurhe were part of the traditional duties of Ihama. When, as a result of old age, the Ihama found it difficult to walk from his Ogbe in Ihogbe quarters to the palace to perform some of his allocated rites, he pleaded with the reigning Oba Ewedo to empower one of his sons to take over the performance of the rites on his behalf. Uku Akpolokpolo approved and later in about 1280 AD, created the title Isekhure, the position in which the descendants of Isekhure functioned for their father until the present Isekhure decided, for reasons best known to him to desecrate it. \n\n\u201cHe (Isekhure) designated his house as a palace where he held court in which he sometimes reviewed cases already dealt with in the Oba\u2019s palace. Senior chiefs were at times openly bad-mouthed and vilified by him and during those times, he declared that the chiefs were not senior to him and that he would not pay respects to them again as palace cultures demand. \n\nHe turned himself into a be all and end all, and a seeming authority in the Benin Culture and tradition, especially palace procedures. He even pronounced himself the head of the royal family\u201d. The Ihogbe family replied the BTC, describing the allegations or face legal action. When this ultimatum was issued, people who understand Oba Ewuare 11 said the chief priest was asking for more trouble. \n\nIn Benin, it is common knowledge that the BTC speaks on behalf of the Oba and therefore any threat issued against BTC is a threat against the Oba. And as it is generally known, no body fights the Oba, and the Ihogbe family threat to go to court worsened the matter. After the  family issued that threat on Monday, on Wednesday, at about 9am, top palace chiefs, led by Chief Eduwu Ekhator, the Obasogie of Benin Kingdom, invaded the palace of  Isekhure with policemen to execute the instruction of the Oba. \n\nTheir mission was to secure the Erimwi-Idu shrine and other properties of the Oba still in the possession of Isekhure. This created traffic jam along Sakpoba Road, Benin-City for several hours, as some youths, who wore a T-Shirt with the inscription \u201cIhogbe youths\u201d, destroyed the status of the Isekhure and every structure erected in the compound which gave the place a semblance of a palace. \n\nFamily members wept uncontrollably as they watched. Before Ekhator ordered the youths to commence the demolition, Isekhure, who locked himself inside his residence since the Oba\u2019s emissaries stormed his place, came out and engaged Ekhator in a heated argument. He accused them of bringing policemen into his compound to arrest him. \n\nHowever, Ekhator urged him to allow them take possession of the Oba\u2019s property in the palace, but  fearing that he may be arrested, Isekhure ran back into the palace and locked the door.  The action infuriated the Oba\u2019s emissaries who now commenced what they described as the process of ostracizing the chief priest. \n\nExplaining their mission, the Obasogie of Benin said: \u201cThis is the process of ostracizing him. The real power house of the monarchical power of the Oba, some of them are here and information reaching the palace is that some of these things are being tampered with. Obviously the Oba is the owner of that building, even though in his magnanimous manner he kept him there to take care of those things. It is like the sceptre bearer of the Oba, and when the Oba says he needs the sceptre and you run away with it, the Oba will look for it. \n\nWe have had cause to secure artefacts and the shrine and possibly the area they occupy. This house is the Oba\u2019s house, we are not after the man; the Oba has already told him to take the extensions he built in there but the original foundation of the palace property should remain where it is, it is a monumental structure and we have to fortify it. \n\nAnd I think all processes required by the palace has been completed before now. He has locked the door, we cannot get to the place which is the Oba\u2019s domain. For now, he is completely ostracized. All his functions have been revoked by the Oba. This is someone who worked under the Oba; during the period of mourning, he refused to perform his duties and even during coronation he was nowhere to be found. So the Oba has asked him to return all he handed over to him so that the original owner will now control it and he is running away. That is unacceptable\u201d. \n\nAnalysts say this is Oba Ewuare 1 who came back to complete what he started in his first coming. Oba Ewuare I ruled Benin Kingdom between 1440-1473 after ascending the throne through a bloody coup. In a recent interview,  the Esogban of Benin, Chief David Edebiri, who gave an insight into the reign of Oba Ewuare I, said: \u201cOba Ewuare I, was everything. \n\nHe was the 13th Oba of Benin. He was politically sagacious. He was an explorer, he was what is today called a diplomat, he was a good manager of people, he is a warrior. His reign here in Benin brought in a lot of social improvement, good streets, cleanliness and more significantly, it was during his reign that white people first got in contact with Benin. \n\nWhen John Squirrel visited this place in 1472, Oba Ewuare was the King here because they were hearing so much about Benin. Ewuare was the most travelled Oba ever since, how he did it nobody knows. They are signs that he visited areas outside the present day Nigeria and established his presence. He was nick named Ewuare Ogidigan, which means Ewuare the Great. \n\n\u201cHe conquered so many areas such as Ekiti, Akure, Igbo land, he went to all those areas and brought them under the Benin empire. He expanded the empire, I gaze may be because he did not get the throne on a platter of gold that made him great. He organized a coup when his brother betrayed him. \n\nOba Ohen was his father, Ewuare\u2019s native name was Ogun, right from when he was small the Benin people saw him as a warrior or someone if allowed to reign was likely to subjugate everybody. They did not like him starting from when he was a Prince. During that period, the rule of primogeniture was really not established fully. The battle was within the royal family. He was not the senior, his senior brother Ezoti took the throne but lasted for only 14 days before he was assassinated. So the throne became vacant again. \n\nThey drove Ogun into exile, he left here with his younger brother Uwaifioku into exile. They were wandering in the bush. He always come into Benin at night to get information about the political situation after that he sneaks back to the forest. It was one of those situations that he came to town that he met a lady called Emotan. Emotan had a hut where she sleeps around Oba market, Ogun sneaked into the place. But before then, he sent his brother to come to Benin to find out what the political situation was. \n\nHis brother Uwaifioku came to Benin, people saw him and were happy to meet him. Because of the love the people showed to him, he sold out and they made him Oba. So when Ogun (Ewuare) sneaked into Emotan\u2019s hut, he was told that his brother has been Crowned King. He was shocked and said my own confidant, I told him to go and spy and report back to me he went to make himself king. That was how Ewuare organized a coup and Uwaifioku was assassinated. \n\nWhen Ewuare became Oba he changed the name of this place from lle to Edo, the name we now bear today. He was a magician, he had medicines that speaks like human beings. He fought 201 wars, captured some many territories, killed their Kings and colonized them within the Benin empire. Many things are traceable to Oba Ewuare even the beads that we wear today. \n\nOba Ewuare died after a long reign and was buried at Essi town, near Udo in Ovia South West, as commanded before his death. This is the Oba who commanded that if he dies because he was sick, they should not bury him in Benin City but in Essi where his mother comes from. The burial place there is preserved, every Oba who wants to ascend the throne must go there to perform certain ceremonies\u201d. \n\nA critical look at where Oba Ewuare 11 is coming from will better give you an insight into the kind of reform that is currently ongoing in the palace. Since his coming, palace chiefs who were used to boycotting palace activities or meetings are said to have have changed their ways. Every Benin chief, no matter how poor, must dress well now before coming to the palace. \n\nThere is peace in virtually all the Benin communities due to his abolition of Community Development Associations. So, it is a big risk to dare Oba Ewuare II because, as history has shown, he can be ruthless if taken for granted. Meanwhile, as of the time of filing this report, the palace of  Isekhure has been sealed and it is prohibited for anyone to go there.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Larry Nwabuoku 5 hours"},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Benin news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"ROYAL RUMBLE: Oba Ewuare II roars again, Chief Priest ostracized, palace sealed","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Online Nigeria News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"556500462","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Online Nigeria News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://news2.onlinenigeria.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200439836","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:31:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Our hearts are still in grief and awe, we have not yet been given an opportunity to mourn our loved ones such as Matshatha Tshuma, Mvulo Nyathi, Simimba Dube among others, who were murdered by Mugabe's in cold blood and their remains eaten by dogs and were in shallow graves for many years until we the community reburied some of them on our own.\" \n\nThe community said memories are still fresh on how the CIO under Emmerson Mngangagwa hunted their leaders down and murdered them in cold blood, one such is their late Zanu councillor Ndlumbi Mpofu among others while many ZAPU leaders and former ZIPRA cadres who had demobilized were arrested and tortured at Matopos, Hazelside police camp some eventually taken to Bhalagwe. \n\n\"We have names of such people who include Stanley Dube of Silozwe among others. \n\nWe still recall how the notorious leader of the CIOs a certain Officer Donga hounded and kidnapped our relatives, some of whom never returned to this day.

We have no powers to stop His Excellency from celebrating his birthday whereever he wants to if we had, we would not want him to dare step his foot in Matobo but history will record that we are against it and that we warned.\" \n\n\"We appeal to the broader Civil Society, opposition parties, media and everyone who is sane and cares to stand in solidarity with us during this painful time of celebrating Mugabe's birthday. We may be arrested, tortured and even disappear we live in fear but our spirits are unwavering. We are being threatened and forced to attend by the regime against our will. \n\nWe fear this man and his people that seem to have lost their minds worshiping him.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ben Hadley2 hours"},"topics":[{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Matobo Community Development complain over police, CIO harassment","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Online Nigeria News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"556500462","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Online Nigeria News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://news2.onlinenigeria.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200441988","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:55:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Going forward, he told Sunday Vanguard, in this interview, why and how Nigeria should be restructured urgently to unleash economic development in the country, among other issues. \n\nOn Obasanjo\u2019s call for Igbo presidency in 2019 \n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s call for Igbo presidency at the next opportunity for election is rather belated because he had a golden opportunity in 2005 when he convened his National Political Reforms Conference, NPRC, to restructure Nigeria and return the country to true federation with fiscal federalism but he bungled it. That would have meant devolution of power to the states and regions, which would have given Nigeria a very strong economic base and we would not have been in recession that we are now. \n\nObasanjo knows that the Igbo nation wants Nigeria to return to true federalism, which can be done this year. Therefore, Igbo prefer restructuring of Nigeria to presidential ambition under the present unitary system. The last Igbo man, who ruled Nigeria under the unitary system was General Aguiyi Ironsi. He was murdered in the July 1966 counter-coup. Why will another Igbo person want to assume presidency of Nigeria under a unitary system as we have today when the last person was murdered? Ndigbo are not ready to make the same unsavoury mistake again. \n\nMajority of Ndigbo are not interested in the Nigerian presidency in our skewed and dysfunctional constitutional system, which is presently unitary instead of truly federal. \n\nTherefore, the Igbo are at the fore-front of the quest for justice, fairness, equity and equilibrium for all parts of Nigeria and the six geo-political zones, which will make Nigeria to become the pride of Africa and no longer the \u2018big for nothing\u2019 entity we are referred to in West Africa and the rest of Africa. \n\nThe restructuring of Nigeria can be done this year because all the documentation has been done by all stakeholders and groups in the country. It should not take more than two months, between now and Easter and there will be a referendum by June. \n\nThe moment that is done, the economy of Nigeria will be turned around immediately because there will be renewed hope from everybody. Let the best thing for the country to be done now. We should no longer postpone the evil day. \n\nWhat about the 1999 Constitution and amendments  embarked upon by the National Assembly? \n\nThe 7th National Assembly had proposed several amendments to the 1999 constitution after a committee of the House had gone round the states for various testimonies. It is a well known fact that former President Goodluck Jonathan did not execute the proposed amendments of the constitution before he stepped down from office. \n\nThe current 8thNational Assembly has also set up a constitution amendment committee which has been working on the details of various amendments which had been the subject of the political, media and other legislative discussions such as the separation of office of the Minister of Justice from that of the Attorney General of the federation, true independence of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC and Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC and the judiciary, etc. \n\nThere are lot of the piece meal amendments, which have been proposed in the current 8th Assembly that are matters which had been discussed and recorded in some of the resolutions of the 2014 National conference. Some of these proposed amendments are definitely relevant and acceptable but such a piece meal method of constitutional review may not be endorsed as the proper means of introducing a totally new constitution for the country. \n\nTo start with, the issue of the introduction of a new constitution for the country was not part of the electoral mandate of the election of 2015. Constitutional lawyers aver that \u201csovereignty belongs to the people\u201d and a new constitution for the country can only be promulgated by the people of Nigeria by virtue of the referendum. \n\nIt is quite clear that the 1999 constitution of Nigeria was promulgated with a \u201clie\u201d. It was not the people of Nigeria who promulgated the constitution. This lie had been emphasized by late jurist Rotimi Williams, SAN and our constitutional Icon Prof. Ben Nwabueze, SAN, likewise other living jurists because it was only endorsed by the ruling military class not by the Nigerian people. \n\nThe revision of the Nigerian constitution must certainly underline the frame work under which the details are being worked out. The present constitution of 1999 is certainly a \u201cunitary\u201d constitution and not a \u201cfederal\u201d constitution. Therefore, the detailed work of the 8th Assembly has to be done with regard to the system of democratic governance we are to return to. \n\nFlaws of past amendments, conferences \n\nThe previous conferences and consultations under the military and under the presidential government of Obasanjo NPRC 2005 and Jonathan National Conference of 2014 did emphasis the return of Nigeria to a truly federal democracy with fiscal federalism and responsibilities. It must definitely be such that the powers of the regions and states which had been aggregated upward and whittled down to the exclusive list of the central government in Abuja must be devolved back to the regions or states or federating units of Nigeria. \n\nGains of true, fiscal federalism \n\nWith true federalism and fiscal federalism, Nigeria would definitely be out of recession within one year and ensure a growth rate of not one per cent but a minimum of five per cent. With a return to parliamentary democracy massive corruption which has been enthroned by the military for 50 years will be drastically reduced ensuring a drastic reduction of unemployment, high wages for the working populace, increase in education and the diversification of the economy with increased productivity and increased foreign reserves from our exports as well as in coming foreign currencies from Nigerians in the Diaspora as well as Foreign Direct Investments, FDI. \n\nThere must be a sense of emergency in Nigeria. The judicial system must be reorganized with multiple and diverse courts to speedily deal with such matters as corruption. The British Supreme Court has just speedily ruled in favour of their parliament discussing and agreeing to the operation of Art 50 of the European Union Treaty before Prime Minister Theresa May initiates any action on the matter \n\nA lot of the agitations which imperil the rule and the quiet habitation of our kit and kin in various parts of the country, killings by herdsmen or religious killings such as the affairs of the Southern Kaduna, agitators in parts of the country such as the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB and Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra, MASSOB and the unnecessarily and illegal incarceration of Nnamdi Kanu and his colleagues, and other agitators in the North or in the Niger Delta would definitely be severely curtailed as the federating units who will be incharge of their internal securities will take care of a lot of the problems. \n\nNeed for meeting of critical stakeholders \n\nIn consideration of the system to be adopted for the future governance of Nigeria, a lot of the leadership of various cultural unions such as Ohanaeze with the new President General of Chief John Nnia Nwodo, the Afenifere with the leadership of Chiefs Reuben Fasoranti and Ayo Adebanjo and the Yourba elders committees, the Arewa Consultative Forum current leadership, the Ijaw National Congress and the PANDEF leadership under Chief Edwin Clark and others, the religious leaders such as the Sultan of Sokoto, the Christian clerics such as Anthony Cardinal Okogie and John Cardinal Onaiyekan and the leadership of the CAN, the Muslim cleric Dr. Ahmad Gumi as well as other eminent Nigerian elite from the political or professional classes should be invited for a review of the constitutional amendments suggested by the 8thNational Assembly for deliberations before their final submissions are put to the nation by way of referendum. All these can be completed by June 2017, as time is of the essence. Nigerians cannot afford to stall at this time, otherwise the resultant effect may be very tragic for the nation. \n\nA conference of notable Nigerians should be summoned by President Buhari by end of February to confer for 30 days to review the papers of previous conferences and national assembly amendments in order to proffer the best options for a national constitution, for a Nigerian referendum by mid-year of 2017. Such a positive attitude would engender an attitudinal hope and change of heart for our immediate restructuring of One Nigeria and mitigate our current economic inabilities. \n\nPersonalities for such a conference should include ex officio notable representatives such as Hon. Justice Idris L. Kutigi, Prof. Bolaji Akinyemi, Justice S. M. Belgore, Justice Mohammed Uwais, Prof. Ben Nwabueze, Sen. Femi Okurounmu, with 20 persons of note representing each of the six zones of Nigeria, etc. \n\nWhat about autonomy for local governments? \n\nThe issue of autonomy of Local Government Councils can only be analysed within its proper context. Local Councils exist either in a unitary or in a federal constitutional set up. In a unitary system the local governments are the appendages of the unitary central government, whereas in a federal set up local councils are under the direct control of the federating units such as the regions or states. \n\nFor the central government today to be allocating funds and dealing with some matters such as primary Education and Health Care, which are local government matters is clearly an adulteration and mix-up of their cardinal roles. For the current state governments to have joint Local Government and State Government accounts largely operated by the state governments today is clearly another mix-up because it is still not clear whether Nigeria is operating a unitary or a federal system of government. \n\nThe speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, surely misunderstood the current mix-up when he told the visiting executives of National Union of Local Government Employees, NULGE, recently that \u201cit is the desire of the National Assembly to grant financial autonomy to local councils in the ongoing move to amend the 1999 constitution.\u201d \n\nThe amendment of the constitution can only be legalized with its adoption by the constitutional majority of the states and National Assembly. \n\nIf the states assembly in Nigeria today are for the enactment of a truly federal constitution for Nigeria then such a proposed amendment will fail. It is quite clear today that the use of the word \u201cFederal\u201d in our current constitution of 1999 is not only illegal but a fallacy. Nigeria operates a unitary form of government today because since 1976 most of the items in the Concurrent List of the 1963 federal constitution had been transferred to the Exclusive List of the centre by military fiat. \n\nTherefore, what the National Assembly should do without hoodwinking the Nigerian populace and the states, which are currently mere appendages of the centre in Abuja is to reverse the militarisation of Nigeria, from a unitary to a federal democracy as was inherited from the British and our forefathers at independence in 1960. Our Governors, Legislators, Legal and other Professionals should be very watchful and ensure that Nigeria moves forward rather than ignorantly racing towards the calamitous precipices of no return.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Larry Nwabuoku 5 hours"},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"2019: Obasanjo goofed on his call for Igbo presidency \u2013 Guy Ikokwu","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Online Nigeria News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"556500462","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Online Nigeria News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://news2.onlinenigeria.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200443684","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:18:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Meanwhile, the country was buffeted with rumours, wild rumours, about the President\u2019s health, as well as unfounded stories about the Yar\u2019Adua/Jonathan-type ugly power transmission and its attendant  high-wire politics; all of which have since been debunked by the Presidency and the Honourable  Minister of  Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed. This  piece takes a globular look at the activities of Vice President Osinbajo and his style each time he acts on behalf of President Buhari. VP Osinbajo \n \nThis would not be his first shot at discharging the functions of the Office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It is not also the second. It is Vice President Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s third, since May 29, 2015. He is fast learning the job and also proving himself a dependable ally of Mr. President. \n \nIn Nigeria, despite the sacred dictates of the constitution, sitting presidents are not usually known to be generous transferers of the powers of their office to their deputies; instead, they choose to delegate such powers to their Chief of Staff or a \u201cKitchen Cabinet\u201d Minister.  \n \nBut that has never been the case with the present administration. \n \nKeen observers of Nigeria\u2019s political experiment since the return of democracy in 1999 would recall that the scenario hardly existed between former President Olusegun Obasanjo and his Vice, Atiku Abubakar. \n \nSuch was still not the case between the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua and his former deputy, former President Goodluck Jonathan. If it ever existed, it was between Jonathan and his vice, Namadi Sambo. \n \nBut in the present regime, delegating the presidential powers to a deputy has never been a big deal for President Buhari who has always done that. \n \nIn the course of his service to the nation in the Fourth Republic, he has had to publicly transfer the powers of his office to his vice. \n \nFIRST TIME OUT \n \nFirst was in February 2016 when the President took some five days off for a vacation abroad. \n \nWhile the vocation lasted, Osinbajo held sway as Acting President. \n \nFor the period, he oversaw the day-to-day running of the affairs of the country. \n \nThe second time Osinbajo was also made the Acting President was in June, 2016 when the President also announced a vacation to London to attend to an ear infection. \n \nFor the 13 days Buhari was abroad  Osinbajo effectively fitted in the shoes of his boss. \n \nAmongst the major tasks he undertook were the meeting with governors of Niger Delta states and the Service Chiefs on the threats of the Niger-Delta Avengers to bomb government buildings in Abuja,. \n \nIt was also during that time that he inaugurated a Task Force on Rice and Wheat production. \n \nThat was not all \u2013 the launching of Home-grown School Feeding Programme was also done. \n \nOn a sad note, it was the lot of Osinbajo to issue condolence messages on the demise of ex-Super Eagles Coaches, late Stephen Keshi and Amodu Shuaibu. \n \nChairing the meetings of the Federal Executive Council, FEC, and the National Economic Council, NEC \u2013 he is constitutionally empowered to chair the latter \u2013 had become almost a norm by this time. \n \nTHE FIRE THIS TIME \n \nYet, on January 19, 2017, another opportunity availed itself for the Vice President to act as President. \n \nInterestingly, Osinbajo was made Acting President while he was in far away Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum, WEF, summit. \n \nUpon his return on Friday, January 20, the Acting President journeyed straight to Ibadan, Oyo State, for a function. \n \nComing back to Abuja, the seat of power, later that evening, he received  updates and briefings on the situation in The Gambia where Nigerian troops were stationed to give effect to the transition from the recalcitrant Yahya Jammeh, to then President-elect, Mr. Adama Barrow. \n \nOsinbajo also took briefings from a number of cabinet ministers. \n \nOn Monday, Jan 23, he chaired the Second Presidential Business Forum which held at the Old Banquet Hall, located within the precinct of Aso Rock Presidential Villa, Abuja. \nKicked off last September, the Forum is a platform to engage and interact with the private sector operators to keep them abreast of government\u2019s economic policies, programmes and activities. \n \nThe Acting President, at the meeting, underscored the need for full public/private partnership in the salvation of the sick economy. \n \nHe said: \u201cI am extremely pleased to welcome you all to this second quarterly business forum. The last one was held in Sept 2016.   This is the first this year and we will ensure it keeps running.   The main plan of our economic plan is the sustenance of the robust private sector partnership. Indeed, it is our strong belief that sustenanable economic growth is only possible if it is private sector led and a great deal of attention has been paid as you will possibly find in sustaining private sector leadership, especially in the plan of economic recovery and growth plan 2017, which is to be launched next month.   The pivot of that plan is the private sector-led recovery growth and plan. So, this Forum is an important one for engendering the continuous engagement that this partnership will entail.\u201d \n \nTuesday, Jan 24 was yet another busy day for Osinbajo. \nHe launched the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises,   MSME Clinics in Abuja. \n \nOrganised in-conjunction with the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, the programme is designed to not only to sensitise operators of Small Scale Enterprises, SMEs in Nigeria on the best business strategies, but to also assist them financially to grow their businesses. \n \nAbia and Kwara State governors were amongst various dignitaries in attendance as the programme was billed to be replicated in the 36 States of the federation starting with Abia. \n \nOne take-away from that event that also held at the Old Banquet Hall was Osinbajo\u2019s displeasure with the activities of most revenue generating agencies of the federal government that delay registration of SMEs and inadvertently, stifle the growth of the SMEs. \n \nEarlier that same day, he had presided over the meeting of Presidential Enabling Business Council, PEBEC, where a decision was taken to begin the evaluation of various options that would eliminate hitches in the Nigerian business climate. \n \nOn Wednesday, Jan 25, the Acting President presided over the Federal Executive Council, FEC, meeting in Abuja. Of course, this was not his first time. It can only be the umpteenth time. \nCuriously,  Wednesday  ended with a stinging controversy. \n \nThe day ended with a wicked rumour that Nigerian Governors were pressuring on Osinbajo to resign his office amidst the rumoured fears of concerns for President Buhari\u2019s health. But his office through the Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters, in the Vice President\u2019s Office, Sen. Femi Ojudu, quickly dismissed the resignation threat in a statement. \n \nThursday, Jan 26, the Acting President performed a function at the National Defence College, NDC, Abuja, and later at  noon  took off to Abia State to launch the first phase (State-wise) of the MSME. \nHe returned to Abuja later in the evening. \n \nFriday, Jan 27, the Acting President was also seen in his office. But it was unknown if he had any functions that required media coverage. At least, not at  5:30 pm  when this piece was being written. \nThe Man, Osibajo \n \nApart from ex-president Olusegun Obasanjo who was lucky to rule Nigeria as a military man and later elected President for two terms, former President Goodluck Jonathan who was within the corridors of power for 16 years; served as Deputy Governor, Governor, Vice President, Acting President and President, and President Buhari who, like Obasanjo, ruled the country militarily and now elected President, Osinbajo is another lucky Nigerian. \n \nHis political profile may not be as rich as those mentioned above but he got lucky, becoming the Vice President of Nigeria from just nowhere \u2013 only  having served as commissioner for justice in Lagos State between 1999 and 2007. \n \nThis is because, Buhari had run for the Number One office in the land for three consecutive times without luck. But Osinbajo, a Pastor of the Redeemed Church of God, RCCG, got elected with Buhari at his fourth shot at the presidency. \n \nThe Acting President is also a Professor of Law. He\u2019s adjudged to be cerebral but to many people, Osinbajo is very carries his professorial calling one step too many in politics (meaning there is too much talk coming from his office) \n \nOsinbajo is a workaholic as well as the typical Lagosian who wouldn\u2019t stay outside of the city for weeks. \n \nSunday Vanguard had observed that most times, he leaves his office as late as  10 pm. Sometimes also, he returns to the office to perhaps, clear his table. \n \nUnlike what characterised the Obasanjo/Atiku Presidency, Sunday Vanguard is yet to notice any face-off between him and his boss. In fact, the feeling is that he\u2019s totally loyal to President Buhari.   This informed why he has been allowed to represent the President in many fora both within and outside the country. Should there be problem between them, many believe that such would have been influenced by external forces. But at the moment, he\u2019s Buhari\u2019s Man but not his Man Friday. \n \nReligion \n \nIs Osinbajo a religious man?   Yes, he is. To him, prayer is key and that\u2019s why the Acting President spares time to pray. \n \nBut just as the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, had to confront him last Friday, it was asked whether the Acting President has for one day shown compassion on his people in the face of the violence unleashed by some criminals on Christians by keeping a disturbing silence as  christians are being slaughtered; to which his office said he   will always defend the rule of law..  \n \nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM: General \n \n    Chuka (Webby) Aniemeka  \nChuka is an experienced certified web developer with an extensive background in computer science and 18+ years in web design &development.

It is regrettable that during the ambush and exchange of gunfire between military escorts and the terrorists, many passengers took to their heels into the bush, and most of them fell victim in the cross fire.. \n\n\u201c I cannot ascertain the number of those  killed as I managed to escape with my passengers. But  I learnt that scores of people were killed or injured\u201d. \n\nEfforts to confirm the story with the Borno State Police Command Public Relations Officer, DSP Victor Isuku, proved abortive as his cell phone lines were not reachable at press time, and the military authorities did not  issue any statement on the attack. \n\nAbout Article Author \n\nChuka (Webby) Aniemeka \n\nChuka is an experienced certified web developer with an extensive background in computer science and 18+ years in web design &development.

I just finished it for the simple reason that it has been difficult to understand how a tiny nation of only three million people could achieve what the GIANT of Africa had failed to do. \n\nWhile Yew\u2019s Singapore continues to move in tandem with the first world, Nigeria keeps sliding inexorably into the Stone Age. Of all the measures taken by the leader of Singapore, admittedly a dictator, from 1965 to 2000, none strikes me as being more important for our needs at this time than his institutionalisation of psychiatric tests for candidates for vital official positions. He made sure, or at least tried, that those appointed to the most important positions in the nation are people who were mentally well-adjusted. \n\nThe Nigerian President who should have borrowed several leaves from Yew was Olusegun Obasanjo who had grown up very close to Nigeria\u2019s first Psychiatric Hospital, at Aro \u2013 just outside Abeokuta. But, like most sensible ideas, the two-time Head of State missed the opportunity; instead, he appointed so many people who should have been inmates at Aro.  Several of our institutions can benefit themselves and Nigeria by adopting Yew\u2019s methods of screening candidates for employment. \n\nOnly God knows how many innocent lives we have lost on account of lunatic police officers shooting fellow citizens for refusing to offer bribes as low as fifty naira. Less frequently are the incidents involving other members of our armed forces taking laws into their own hands and wasting human lives. Senior officers sat in their official cars while junior staff assaulted women on account of a traffic dispute; some have drafted their subordinates to intervene in civil matters. \n\nBut, right now, the most pervasive of all the injustices and atrocities Nigerians, rich and poor, young and old, male and female, face, are those associated with the Nigerian Power Sector. Forgive the tough language; but if a totally deranged person were to be asked to design a system and foist it on a society which is meant to make their lives totally miserable, it would be difficult to imagine one worse than the Nigerian Power Sector. From the Ministry down to the fellows carrying ladders around, mainly to disconnect the lines of people who enjoyed no power supply but are forced to pay, it is really impossible to believe that those responsible for these atrocities don\u2019t deserve the Yew treatment. \n\nFashola and Buhari \n\nPermit me a slight diversion \u2013 but, it is necessary to drive home the point that the Power Sector had gone out of whack. \n\nIn the 1960s to early 1970s, when studying in American universities, it was common for the graduating class, at least undergraduates, to elect among themselves the Student Most Likely To Succeed. It was even done in some High Schools. Based on comparative performance with his peers, somebody always emerges. If that idea had been adopted in Nigeria when Buhari announced his list of Ministers, it is almost certain that Babatunde Fashola would have been voted the Minister Most Likely to Succeed. But, here we are, fifteen months after they were given portfolios and the Ministry that is making our lives most miserable is the Ministry of Power. And, it is not only doing it 24/7, it is impoverishing us as well. Meanwhile, what we have been getting are the same excuses and promises of \u201cpolicies put in place to make the situation better\u201d.   In short, the same stuff we heard from late Chief Bola Ige, Lyel Imoke, Professors Bart Nnaji and Nebo. They can\u2019t even think of a new excuse to offer anymore. In Yew\u2019s Singapore, Ministers offer excuses only once and then provide solutions or get kicked out. \n\nClearly, it seems fair to ask those in charge that if they cannot provide power they should not drive us crazy as well because what we now have is a situation which can only be described as bedlam. Let me provide what is now becoming an increasing occurrence. Then, you can judge if people in full control of their senses would be doing those things to the people they are actually paid to serve. \n\nJanuary 20, 2017 was a Friday. It was also the day President Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States of America. That date will remain indelible in my memory, not because of Trump, but because of what the operators of the Nigerian Power Sector did to me and millions of Nigerians. There was no power supply for more than ten days and we had been watching Trumps inauguration programme using expensive petrol costing N3000 per day. Suddenly, the power change-over alarm went off indicating that DISCO power had been restored to the neighbourhood. Predictably, the kids in unison shouted UP NEPA!!! We switched immediately from generator to DISCO line. In less than one minute we were back in total darkness. That bit of nonsense had occurred more than ten times in this new year alone. \n\nThe obvious questions everybody, the Minister included, involved in power supply should answer is: if they were not ready to restore power supply, why tease the people? Do they realize the emotional trauma they inflict on people who had been financially burdened and who thought relief had been offered to them? \n\nUnfortunately, the matter did not end there. Power was restored about forty-five minutes after the first one. Once again, those with generators turned them off. Power failure occurred ten minutes after. From ten o\u2019clock on the evening of January 20, 2017 until six o\u2019clock in the early morning of January 21, 2017, the same pattern was repeated seven times. The next morning, there was only one question on the lips of everybody: are these people insane? Suddenly Nigerians have stopped questioning the sincerity and honesty of their leaders; they now worry more about their sanity!! \n\nJust in case you think that these are members of the political opposition, let me assure you that these were individuals who voted overwhelmingly for Fashola in his two elections and have always been proud of his achievements. They also voted almost totally for the All Progressives Congress, APC in 2015. They are the ones questioning the sanity of those in charge of the Power Sector. For most of us, the matter is simple. If you have no power to supply \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 don\u2019t continue to dribble us with one minute power supplies. We wonder about the sort of individuals occupying the top positions in the power generating, transmission and distribution stations. We ask: what sort of individual, presumably in his right senses, will authorize power supply for one minute to a community which had been deprived for weeks or months? Do they derive joy from the psychological stress they cause people by teasing them with one minute power supply? \n\nLet me close with a true story. A fellow in his mid-70s living in his own house had for safety reasons placed the generator far from the main building in a shed about fifty metres away. One stormy day, while operating his gen-set, the warning signal came \u2013 \u201cNEPA\u201d power was available. To save funds, he went to the backyard to turn off the gen-set. He had barely entered the main building when power failure occurred. He went back to turn on the gen-set; walked a few steps and NEPA was on again. He turned back; turned off the gen-set; took a few steps and black out again. All these occurred in drenching rain. What do you call people who do that sort of thing to their fellow citizens? Do they enjoy it? \n\nFashola has choices to make. He can either turn the situation around very quickly; or find his well-earned reputation go down on account of failure; or\u2026.. \n\nCan he not offer the suggestion to Buhari to employ shrinks for those working in the Power Sector? One minute power supply is absolutely abnormal; let\u2019s face it. \n\nAkoba adaba Olorun maje kari\u2026. \n\nTHANK GOD FOR TRUMP. THE WORLD MUST STAND UP TO AMERICA \n\nAn empire founded by war has to maintain itself by war \n\nCharles Montesquieu, 1689-1755.\u2014(VANGUARD BOOK OF QUOTATIONS, VBQ, p 47. \n\nAmerica was founded on war and it has been fighting wars, major and minor, ever since \u2013 until the last few years. The Obama years have seen the gradual winding down of American war-mongering. And Americans don\u2019t like that. The American military-industrial complex is declining and they don\u2019t want that. For the arms suppliers nothing is more profitable than a government which orders those expensive war-toys; sends them out to be destroyed; and comes back for more. Obama was not that sort of President and Clinton was cut out of the same piece of cloth as the immediate past president of America. Now, they have a gun-slinger in Trump. Predictably, he had taken t a page out of the play-book of another eager warrior, Adolf Hitler, 1889-1945. \n\nBefore becoming Chancellor, Hitler had written a book, in which he promised, if elected, to repudiate virtually all agreements signed by Germany with other nations because, he, Hitler, regarded them as unfair to Germany. There would be no negotiations to consider alterations. Hitler was going to tear them up. Trump also promised to tear up agreements he regards as unfair to America and among his first executive orders was to start tearing up those he unilaterally disapproves of. \n\nMany of our readers would recollect his promise to build a wall between Mexico and America and make the Mexicans pay for it. Hitler also invaded Poland, destroyed the poor and weaker country and made the Poles pay for his losses during the invasion. \n\nEach time a former power is in decline, a leader emerges promising to \u201cmake the country great again\u201d. It invariably means declaring war, at first verbal but later military, on those perceived to be standing in the way of that ambition. Yet, all empires must fall like Assyria, Sparta, Greece, Rome and Great Britain. One million Trumps cannot create an eternal global power irrespective of what they do. \n\nHowever, Trump has done the world, and Nigeria, a favour. He had ordered a reduction in foreign aid to other countries. I honestly hope that Nigerian leaders will be courageous enough to henceforth reject any assistance from the USA as some countries are already planning to do. We should throw away the begging bowl we now place in front of America and with pride chart our own course \u2013 however difficult the road to self-reliance might be. Given Trump\u2019s known character, he can only be a patron \u2013 \u201ccommonly a wretch who supports with insolence\u2026\u201d (Dr Samuel Johnson, 1709-1784, VBQ, p 183). The man will expect us to lick his behind in exchange.

Mama Helen Oritsejafor, as she is fondly called, is one of the surviving 18 children of the late Pa Gabriel Ojo Falegan. \n\nSpectacular traditional costumes, displays by  Ijaw dancers, Urhobo dancers, Ogonor for Jesus (Itsekiri evangelical group of entertainers) and Ukweke Show in four carefully decorated long trucks depicting fishing boats and canoes with very colourfully attired young men and women bearing  paddles representing the different traditional riverine cultures with diverse traditional musical instruments toured major streets of Ado Ekiti with the grey-colored casket of the high chief in tow. \n\nThe loud procession began from Ile-Abiye Hospital on Ilawe Road and snaked its way to the Ado Ekiti Local Government Secretariat for a commendation service and a brief lying-in-state for the late father-in-law of Oritsejafor, the immediate National President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, who had  mobilized the Itsekiri, the Urhobo, the Ijaw and other well wishers from across the country for the five-day event in Ado-Ekiti. \n\nAs at Wednesday when a lecture was delivered by Prof. Gbenga Aribisala in honour of the fallen politician, facilities in most hotels in Ado Ekiti and several adjoining public facilities including the NYSC Corpers Lodge had already been overstretched and no one was left in doubt that something spectacular was in the offing that weekend.  The Atunluse of Ede and Atunwase of Ise-Ekiti was laid to rest on Saturday at his residence in Falegan Estate, Ilawe Road, Ado Ekiti after a funeral service at The Name of Jesus Ministries, Iyin Road, Ado Ekiti. \n\nAn elaborate reception where guests were entertained took place at the Ekiti State Pavilion, along Secretariat Road, Ado Ekiti. There was plenty to eat and drink for all those who thronged the various venues throughout the duration of the funeral ceremony with a cow roasted on a daily basis as barbecue. \n\nApart from the loud display of culture from the riverine communities of Nigeria deployed to honour Helen (nee Falegan) the matriarch of the Word of Life Bible Church, the Oritsejafor Family\u2019s In-Law Greeting on Thursday evening was a spectacle to behold. It featured several traditional dances, most of which was evangelical in nature as the entertainers sang, danced to showcase the virtues of the Rock of Ages. \n\nThe large Warri family was led by a former Minister of State for Defence and Ogwa of Warri Kingdom, Chief Roland Oritsejafor, who used the occasion to extoll the virtues of the fallen chief and his noble family of Ado Ekiti for \u201cthe beautiful daughter they have given to us and who has been a wonderful wife, a great mother, a spirit-filled daughter of God and source of mighty blessing to us all in Delta State and beyond\u201d.  He added: \u201cWe are grateful to God specially that this rare gem, Mama Helen, is our daughter-in-law. \n\n\u201cWe are most sincerely grateful to God who had given her the power and wisdom to build a beautiful house for the Oritsejafors and we are most sincerely for the Falegans who had released her to us. We want to express our gratitude to friends, well wishers from far and near who had taken time to join us in this glorious celebration of life. We are celebrating Papa because indeed, he had achieved a lot in this short period of his life. So, we are very delighted to be partakers of his life and achievements. Through his children, friends and well wishers will continue to remember papa\u201d. His statement naturally elicited  applause from the crowd. \n\nThe Chairman of Ado-Ekiti Progressive Union, Chief David Fasuan, also extolled the virtues of the fallen chief in a brief remark, saying Falegan gave scholarship to several students of his school who were unable to pay their fees, and actually harboured many who today are movers and shakers in the Nigerian nation. \n\nWhile speaking on behalf of the Delta State governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, his Special Senior Adviser on Religious Affairs, Rev. (Mrs.) Omatsola Williams, urged all those present at the ceremony to strive to imbibe the many good testimonies that had been so eloquently spoken of the fallen chief, stressing that the legacy any human being would leave behind should and must be the good reports people give of you. \n\nThe special adviser described the former CAN President as a spiritual icon who had moved Delta State to Ado Ekiti to join in establishing his love that he has for the Falegan family in view of what he came several years ago to plead for a hand of one of daughters of the family, and has thus become a part of Ekiti people, stressing \u201cyour effort in ensuring peace in Delta State and numerous contribution to the development of many both spirtually and physically in the state and beyond has earned you this support from the Delta State government.\u201d \n\nOne of Nigeria\u2019s versatile music producers/gospel singers and incidentally a son of the soil, Yinka Ayefele, was on hand to entertain the large crowd and 74-year old highlife/juju maestro, Evangelist Ebenezer Obey, former Ekiti State governor, Engineer Segun Oni, Bishop G.O. Onifade, Chief Joseph Otumara, Chief Brown Mene, and others danced heartily to the medley of praise songs.  \n\nEarlier, we had the current PFN national president, Rev. Felix Omobude and his wife, Abiola, former CAN Vice President/presiding bishop of TREM, Bishop Mike Okonkwo, Rev. Don Odunze Jnr, senior pastor of Hilltop International Christian Centre, Port Harcourt, Rev. Chris Oarhe and his wife, Administration Secretary of PFN, Pastor Damilare Akinola among others came to facilitate with the Falegans in solidarity with Papa Ayo Oritsejafor who was full of gratitude to all.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Larry Nwabuoku 8 hours 1 minute ago"},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"The day Ijaw, Itsekiri, Urhobo stormed Ekiti for Oritsejafor\u2019s in-law","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Online Nigeria News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"556500462","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Online Nigeria News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://news2.onlinenigeria.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200450084","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T23:58:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The site said while taking some time away from her mommy duties, Angela took time to show off her incredible figure. \n \n\u201cThe 29-year-old showed off her incredible figure in a patterned bikini and a sheer cover up \u2013 less than four months after giving birth to son Sutton Joseph.\u201d \n \nThe site also included photos of Simmons wearing a thong swimsuit as she put her booty on display.

Let us be honest. As the governor of Edo State, we have had to sponsor, and the records are there, first, Nigerian medical doctors, who request for it in black and white that they had to be treated in India, the UK or US and they give me a variety of reasons why they need that foreign medical check. \n \n\u201c\u200eI have seen villagers approaching me that they had prostrate (cancer). They had gone to some local hospitals and they had challenges and they want support to go to India. I had used state funds to support very ordinary people and all kinds of people, including the media, politicians and farmers. \n\u201c\u200eI have had course to travel outside Nigeria for a comprehensive medical check, when I was in doubt. And the experience of Gani Fawehimi shows that if ordinary Nigerian labourers, medical doctors find course to go and do what we call routine physical check, why \u200ewould anybody make it such a big issue that any Nigerian, including our president, should be denied the right for a thorough check.\u201d \n \nOshiomhole stated that it was unfortunate that some Nigerians preferred to peddle negative speculation \u200eto the extreme, rather than wish the President well. \n \nHe, therefore, urged Nigerians to be cautious of their utterances. \n \nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM: General \n \n    Chuka (Webby) Aniemeka  \nChuka is an experienced certified web developer with an extensive background in computer science and 18+ years in web design &development.

Like I have always said, we have an end to white collar jobs, so the future and now is for those who are creative, innovative and those who can use their energy and talent to create employment\u201d. \n\nGovernor Ambode said his administration believes that no nation or state can achieve its full potential without adequate attention to matters of heritage and culture or without due encouragement for the teeming youthful population that sees and seeks opportunities in the creative industries. \n\n\u201cCreativity is the most valuable asset in any progressive society. Therefore, progressive governments must embrace creativity. We are committed, and we must reward contributors of creative ideas with incentives. \n\n\u201cThis is why we are keenly interested in further development of our creative talents; in providing them with support and opportunities to be engaged; in helping to create platforms such as today\u2019s to excel and compete globally and in showing to the world that Lagos is more than ready to announce its arrival as the continent\u2019s frontline destination of choice that gives arts and culture their due,\u201d the Governor said. \n\nHe said with the Arts Exhibition, aside seeking to immortalise the sterling contributions of the late Co-Chair of the Lagos @ 50 Committee, Chief Rasheed Gbadamosi, presented a veritable platform for his administration to show its passion for the creative arts especially by encouraging young and budding talents. \n\nAbout Article Author \n\nChuka (Webby) Aniemeka \n\nChuka is an experienced certified web developer with an extensive background in computer science and 18+ years in web design &development.

Our colleagues in the North, South-East and South-South are running their own businesses because they are selling above the pump price.\u201d \n\nAhmed urged the Federal Government to fully deregulate the petroleum sector so that individuals could buy and sell the product at a price considerate enough to keep everyone in business. \n\nAnother executive of the association, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said his members bought fuel at N145 from private depots in Apapa, Ejigbo, and Oghara. \n\nAccording to him, the non-availability of the product at depots owned by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation for some years has compounded the problem. \n\nHe said, \u201cWe decided not to cause panic by not openly announcing our intention to stop lifting fuel. The people will start feeling the effect as from Monday if the government fails to do anything about it. We have held series of meetings with the owners of private depots to reduce their price but they refused, claiming that it would affect their business too. \n\n\u201cI am still running some of my stations because I have my own trucks. I bought fuel at N143 per litre at a private depot in Apapa and would transport a litre with N6 to Akure and other towns. This means I am running at a loss because I have to sell at N145, being the official pump price. I am doing this just to keep the stations running. I usually load eight trucks. But I load just two now.\u201d \n\nThe IPMAN Chairman, Ore Depot branch, Mr. Shina Amao, also confirmed the development and attributed the problem to the non-functional state of NNPC-owned depots where the product could be bought at N133.38k. \n\nHe said, \u201cGovernment should, without further delay, resume the pumping of fuel to the NNPC-owned depots in Ore, Ibadan (Mosimi), Ejigbo and Warri so that we can buy at the official landing cost of N133.28k as against the N145 per litre at the private depots.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Mandy Oteng2 hours"},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Marketing news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Independent marketers threaten to stop lifting fuel this week","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Online Nigeria News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"556500462","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Online Nigeria News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://news2.onlinenigeria.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200452915","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:42:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He  announced that the leaders had chosen Senator Ken Nnamani to be the leader of the APC in the South-East. \n\nObasanjo had, last week, at an event in Abeokuta, Ogun State capitl, said the Igbo people should be allowed to produce the president, possibly in 2019. \n\nAmong those present at  yesterday\u2019s  meeting, held at the Imo International Convention Centre, IICC, Owerri, were Nnamani, Sir Emeka Offor, Senator Ifeanyi Araraume, Chief George Moughalu, Tony Eze, Ebuka Onunkwo, Jombo Offor, Eze Madumere, members of the National Working Committee of  the APC and some  prominent politicians in the zone. \n\nSpeaking after the meeting held  behind closed doors, Okorocha said: \n\n\u201cNow that Igbo leaders are together in APC, Nigerians will hear us. There is a vacuum of leadership in the South-East APC. I am a governor. My brothers Chris Ngige and Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu are Ministers. Hence the importance of Ken Nnamani coming at this time. I decline the leadership of Ndi-Igbo in APC. With Ken Nnamani, the question of who is the leader of APC in the South-East has been answered. Ken Nnamani is the leader of APC in the South-East. \n\n\u201cSenator Nnamani should then work with other leaders like Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, Jim Nwobodo and a host of others to give Ndi-Igbo political direction. Those who have joined the party or who want to join should do so to build the party and not to cause  confusion. APC is the right party for the Igbo, and the only party that can guarantee Igbo presidency. \n\n\u201cWe are going to support President Mohammadu Buhari for the eight  years he is going to lead the nation. This is the time for Ndi-Igbo to come and work together. We are also going to use the Anambra election to show that APC has arrived South-East. The Igbo  played bad politics in 2015. Today, we have lost a lot. We are not anywhere because of our bad politics\u201d. \n\nOkorocha also disclosed that three serving governors in the South-East were in touch with him and will soon join APC, adding that being the only APC governor in the South-East did not give him joy and advised that other political leaders in the South-East to take advantage of the moment and  join  APC. \n\nIn his speech, Nnamani said the Igbo needed  more of their leaders at the national leadership of the APC where decisions are made, and even at the National Assembly and other strategic levels.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Larry Nwabuoku 5 hours"},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Igbo APC leaders rebuff Obasanjo, endorse Buhari for 2019","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Online Nigeria News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"556500462","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Online Nigeria News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://news2.onlinenigeria.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200455111","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:21:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We know that as an administrator you must have  challenges, one of which is the issue of staff salary.  How  have you have been coping? \n\nThe truth of the matter is that the UCTH does not owe  staff salary. In  October, November and December 2016, we had a shortfall which was a national challenge. In fact, the first two hospitals to be affected were the Federal Teaching Hospital, Irua  and the Federal Medical Centre, Yenogoa. \n\nYou are also aware that at the beginning of last year, the Federal Government reduced personnel allocation to Ministries, Departments and Agencies ,MDAs, by about 10 per cent and most of us who knew this told our staff that we were    going to have shortfall and that they may not receive October salary. Some of them thought we were    unserious. I was even blackmailed that I put their money in MMM, and    I don\u2019t know what MMM means. I won\u2019t do that, you don\u2019t touch people\u2019s money as they have wives and husbands who depend on them. \n\nLuckily, the Federal Government  corrected the shortfall because money was sourced and paid to all MDAs that had shortfall, including teaching hospitals. So when people say we ate their money, going around blackmailing us that we put funds in MMM, I look at them and  laugh because there is no truth in it. UCTH and most teaching hospitals  across the country are not owing staff salary. \n\nWhat about salary  and promotion arrears in  the university  teaching hospital system? \n\nPromotion arrears in  the teaching hospital system date back to 2013 when IPPIS came in. The Federal Government has not been paying promotion arrears since 2013. In 2013, they made part, payment, promotion arrears for 2014 to 2016 have not been paid. Even the promotion that was done in 2016 in most  teaching hospitals, including Calabar, the report has not come out from the Federal Ministry of Health. The implication is that we depend on our supervisory ministry, and if money is not given to you, how do you pay? For now, 2014, 2015, 2016 and part of 2013 promotion arrears have not been paid. Government has calculated it, it is in the budget office and all that is needed is for the Federal Minister of Finance to give cash \u2013backing. The government is doing their best to ensure that civil servants in the health sector do not suffer unnecessarily because it is their right not a privilege. \n\nProfessor Thomas Agan \n\nOutside  salary arrears and promotion, what of the area training of doctors- what has your administration been doing about it in terms of sponsorship? \n\nWhen you talk of sponsorship, there hasn\u2019t been  budgetary provision for sponsorship. At a time we were paying sponsorship from personnel allocation but we were stopped. For instance, if I am given N6 million to manage this teaching hospital- this overhead is  supposed to take care of diesel supply- a truck load of diesel of 40,000  liters is how much? It is almost N12 million. Then you talk of other things. You need to buy stationery, you need to do repairs, you need to maintain, and you need to do all kinds of things. The overhead cannot carry the head. So for now, we owe resident doctors  sponsorship allowance and we are appealing to them to exercise patience, by God\u2019s grace, government will take into consideration some of these things. Some of these things are things that if we look critically inwards, we can  resolve. \n\nRecently, you tried to do away with outsourced services in UCTH. Was it an internal decision or the decision came the Federal Ministry of Health? \n\nThe decision to outsource services  is a government decision- some of the services being rendered by staff were outsourced. The staff affected include security personnel, cleaners, laundry. The implication is that a contractor will now bid and then recruit people to come and do those jobs. Unfortunately, something went wrong and since 2009 till date government has not been funding it. So, there no budgetary provision for outsourced services. We were funding from internally generated revenue. \n\nBetween 2009 and 2012, we were paying from personnel. In 2012, ICPC invited some of us and gave us stern warning over it and even wrote to us that we were liable to be jailed if we pay that way. It came to a point where we were asked to pay from capital allocation and as the budget is coming out it is expunged. So, we are owing part of 2013, 2014 and 2015. As I am talking, many of them have taken us to court while some have assaulted us physically, and some have even gone as far as assaulting our family members. \n\nAs of November 2016, we are owing about N229 million to outsourced companies.   As Chairman of the  Committee of CMDs, I have written to the Minister of Finance to authorize the payment because it is their right, not a privilege. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about  infrastructural development in  UCTH. Could you let us know how far it has been in terms electricity, the state of the theatre, the toilets  and bathrooms?  \n\nWhen you talk about infrastructural development, it has been very slow because of the dwindling economy. Recession is affecting everything in  this country. I can tell you that from when I took over in 2011, we had capital budget of about N600 million, out of which only 52 per cent  was released. In 2012, we had about N400 million, out of this only 48 per cent was released. In 2013, out of  about N400, only 38 per cent was released. So it has  continued to dwindle. \n\nThis hospital was constructed in 1977 and, somewhere along the line, it was  abandoned and then hoodlums removed the glasses, the roof and everything. Well, we have moved in but it is not possible do what we should do. We couldn\u2019t develop because you can give what you don\u2019t have. \n\nBesides infrastructure, electricity bill is one of  our  greatest challenges. In fact, we pay almost N6m monthly. And in the absence of public power supply, the generators are functioning very well. We have  a 515 KVA generator  mounted inside the laboratory and it can supply electricity  to the entire hospital.  It is just that I don\u2019t like them to do that because it can break down easily. We also have a 500 KVA generator  mounted at the theatre which supplies light to the theatre and some parts of the hospital. Recently we  contemplated acquiring  a 200 KVA generator only  for the radiology department because the equipment there are very sensitive- they cannot withstand public power supply. Due to this off and one, the equipment there break down easily, so we are working on that and we will get it soon. \n\nLet me take you back to some of the issues patients have been complaining about. One is the issue of drugs revolving in the hospital. How functional has that scheme been? \n\nYou know too well that when the Federal Government introduced the Treasury Single Account (TSA), every money generated, whether it is from  drug revolving fund or from anywhere, must go to  the TSA. There is nothing special about TSA, so any money that is going there is utilized. Secondly, if you generate N5, 000  and  you are looking for N10, 000, from which subhead do you get that money? If the pharmacy generates N5, 000 and they are looking for N10, 000, where do you get the money from? The drug suppliers claim that the hospital is owing them, the hospital cannot owe you. Suppliers are being paid, not that they are not being paid. Sometimes I hear stories outside and they gets me very offended- that because they are owing GRF, who is owing GRF? Is it the teaching hospital or government? We are paying and we will continue to pay, anybody who is being owed will be paid fully. I have vowed that this 2017 I want to clear as much as possible all debts owed to some of these people so that I will have peace. When I am leaving, I leave in peace. \n\nLet me take you back to the issue of the Committee of CMDs. Doctors  allege that the committee is responsible for the crisis in hospitals. What crisis are they talking about? \n\nThe crisis the doctors keep raising is that the CMDs don\u2019t cooperate with them, they don\u2019t discuss with them. Every staff is staff and as a chief executive, you don\u2019t just come and open the books and announce on television and radio that government has sent you  money for this or that. It is administratively wrong. Sometimes people have to know the basics, it is not everything you analyse to staff. Worse still, people who need positions are the people who instigate crisis in  hospitals. \n\nThey are not only instigating resident doctors, they are instigating other staff. They blackmail you; write petitions to EFCC, ICPC, police headquarters, media, every nook and cranny of the world. I have told doctors nationwide that I am ready to solve their problems as long as they are ready to stop striking unnecessarily. I will join the Federal Government to solve their problems which are very minor as far as I am concerned. Abroad you pay school fees to be trained as a resident doctor. In Nigeria government pays you and trains you. As far as I am concerned, it is a privilege and not a right because they are paid salary. \n\nThe Minister issued a directive on the detention of patients following inability to pay hospitals bills.  As  the Chairman of the Committee of  CMDs, what is your response? \n\nThe truth of the matter is that people are not ready to pay; it is not that there is no money to pay. Nigerians want to be treated free, not that they don\u2019t have the money. Now we insist that anybody that comes must pay deposit unless the person comes unconscious, and they are paying. Nobody should deceive you that they don\u2019t have money; they will tell the public that they are being detained but they are not being detained by anybody.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Larry Nwabuoku 3 hours"},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sponsorship news","group":"Business"}],"title":"I was blackmailed for allegedly putting UCTH funds in MMM\u2014 Prof. Agan, CMD","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Online Nigeria News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"556500462","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Online Nigeria News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://news2.onlinenigeria.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200455830","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:29:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Stay is national,\u201d ACLU Voting Rights Project Director, Dale Ho, said on Twitter. \n \nCrowds outside the Federal Court in Brooklyn, New York, cheered the news. \n \nThe ACLU said the judge ordered a list of detainees to be provided, and said it would go through the names and ensure they are released. \n \n\u201cBut the critical point tonight is no one can be sent back to one of these countries,\u201d Lee Gelernt, Deputy Director of the ACLU Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said. \n \nThe order, signed by Trump on Friday, puts in place a 120-day hold on entry of refugees to the U.S., and indefinitely suspends the admission of Syrian refugees until the president is satisfied that changes have been made. \n \nIt also suspends entry for 90 days from certain countries based on statute related to the Visa Waiver Programme. \n \nThe most recent version of that programme lists Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as countries to be affected by the President\u2019s order. \n \nTrump said the order was necessary to keep foreign terrorists out of the U.S. \n \nThe president had during his campaig and after taking office called for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of some people entering the country. \n \nThe order has drawn many criticisms since Friday, prompting widespread protests especially in New York. \n \nProtests erupted in several airports across the U.S. on Saturday over the executive order, which turned into celebrations after the stay was granted. \n \nDemonstrators at a terminal at John F.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 36 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lancaster","zipCode":"17603","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lancaster","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WGAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169674001","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"166"},"name":"WGAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wgal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200465918","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Saturday night's ruling came in response to a challenge filed on behalf of two Iraqi men detained Friday night at JFK International Airport and impacted up to 200 others held across the country. \n \nAn unknown number of others intending to come back to the United States are trapped in other countries, unable to board planes. \n\n \nJudge Ann Donnelly's emergency stay, issued after an emergency hearing in Brooklyn, does not allow those detained at airports and those  in transit Saturday to enter or re-enter the United States. Her ruling, however, prevents the government from returning them to their home countries. Dozens of airport arrivals remain in limbo, unable to enter the country. \n \nThe judge also ordered the federal government to turn over a list of everyone currently being detained. \n \nShe did not rule on the constitutionality of Trump's order. And the order did nothing to quell the uncertainty and chaos at U.S. entry points caused by the order, issued without notice and little or no guidance to immigration agents on how to handle those arriving. \n\n \nTrump made no exception for people already vetted and admitted into the country legally but who were out of the country when he signed the executive order. \n \nOne of the Iraqi men, who was handcuffed at JFK Airport, worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army in Iraq for 10 years. He had been granted a special immigrant visa. He was among dozens of people stopped at airports around the United States on Saturday. At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , as many as 18 people were reportedly detained, including children and a man with a green card returning from a family wedding in Saudi Arabia . The detentions at the nation's major airports moved thousands of people to arrive at airports in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities to protest, chanting \"let them in\" and \"this is what democracy looks like.\" \n \n\"We won,\" said the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Voting Rights Project, Dale Ho, reacting to the ruling. \n \nJack Vimo, policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center, said the lawyers for the two JFK detainees met four crucial factors: \n the executive order causes irreparable harm; they have a likelihood of success on merits; there is no harm to the government; there is a likelihood of receiving class certification. \nVimo tweeted that the ACLU informed the judge the government was putting someone on a plane back to Syria. The judge saw that as putting someone at risk of irreparable harm. \n \nThe ACLU said it will continue to file suits on behalf of anyone who is stopped. \n \nIt was not clear if the government would appeal the judge's ruling. If it does, both sides will file briefs and a hearing will likely be held within days. \n\n \nShortly after the ruling, another judge, hearing a similar case in the federal court in Virginia, struck another blow against Trump's order. \n \nJudge Leonie Brinkema ordered that the government refrain from deporting any green-card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport and allow lawyers to meet with the detainees. \n\nA third federal judge - this one in Washington - also ordered a stay. \n\nJudge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay forbidding the government from removing two individuals from the United States until a hearing next week. \n\nThere are also cases pending in Chicago, New York, and other cities. \n \nTrump's executive order \u2014 which exempts certain diplomats traveling to the United States but does not mention those legally residing in the country as lawful permanent residents or with student or employment visas who might be returning to the U.S. \u2014 has created a new class of detainees in the United States. \n\n \nLawyers involved in the case heard in Brooklyn put the number of those held at 100 to 200. \n \nWhile many of Trump's executive orders have been met with criticism for their message, the immigrant ban has already had real impact on real people. \n \nThe seven countries in the order are not named but officials say they include Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Yemen and Sudan. Trump's order also bans the resettlement of refugees for four months and indefinitely suspends the entry of Syrian refugees. \n\n \nPeople who had been given visas to enter the United States after putting their families at risk by helping American troops were stopped as they exited airplanes arriving in airports in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, and other cities. \n \nThe lawyers for two Iraqis who had been granted visas to enter the United States and were detained at John F. Kennedy airport, also are seeking class certification so that they can similarly represent all individuals covered by the executive order. That includes people with approved refugee applications, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas and other individuals from the seven countries banned by the executive order but who would have otherwise been granted legal admission to the U.S. \n \nWhen signing the order, Trump said it was aimed at keeping out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n \nLawyers consulted by ProPublica said the ban could apply to hundreds of thousands of people from these countries who already live in the U.S. under green cards or on temporary student or employee visas. Reuters reported that green card holders from the seven countries who are now out of the U.S. will have to be cleared on a case-by-case basis to re-enter. \n \nA State Department statement reviewed by the Wall Street Journal but not been officially released says the ban would also apply to citizens of those seven countries who hold dual nationality. A federal law enforcement official told The Associated Press that those already in the U.S. with a visa or a green card would be allowed to stay. \n \nA senior administration official pushed back on the idea that the order was a Muslim ban, listing several predominantly Muslim countries that were not affected by the ban. \n \n\"We\u2019re dealing with a relatively small universe of people,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s important to keep in mind that no person living or residing overseas has a right to entry to the U.S.\" \n \nAsked about the immigration executive order on Saturday, Trump said it was not a Muslim ban. \n \n\"It\u2019s working out very nicely,\" he said. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n \nThe administration is still working to define \"in transit\" for the purposes of the hardship exemption for refugees who have been approved to enter the United States but are currently in a third country, according to the official. \n \nThe ACLU has lawyers stationed at airports across the country. \"If you know someone entering country, tell them not to sign anything before talking to lawyer,\" the ACLU tweeted . \n \nEven after the stay was issued Saturday night, it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to refugees and immigrants detained at airports across the country. \n \nAt JFK International Airport in New York City, dozens of attorneys huddled in the Terminal 1 arrivals hall attempted to explain to anxious family members what would happen to their relatives, who were still in federal custody. \n \nJennifer Johnson, another attorney volunteering Saturday at JFK, said she and others were still being denied access to the detainees. She said that tried to deliver a printed copy of the stay to the airport's CBP headquarters, but officers wouldn't accept it \u2014 so she slipped it under the door. \n \n\"Where are our clients? Where are our friends? Where are our family members?\" she said. \"Let's talk about the people still detained.\" \n\n \nSoon after, one Syrian woman in a wheelchair was released from Terminal 8 at JFK. \n \nIn Chicago, where the international terminal was packed with protesters, both inside and out, tearful reunions took place amid cheers as some detainees were released. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, responding to the O'Hare detentions, blasted the president's actions. \n \nTrump's actions \"have tarnished America's standing as a beacon of hope for the free world,\" Emanuel saidin a statement. \"Following the stay that was granted this evening, I am calling on the federal government to immediately produce a list of the names of anyone currently being detained at O'Hare or Midway airports, and calling on those unjustly affected to immediately be released and allowed access to legal counsel.\" \n\n\nAfter the judge's ruling in Brooklyn, those detained in Chicago were released. \n \nNBC Philadelphia reported two Syrian families detained at Philadelphia Airport were sent home on a return flight. The New York Times reported that the trip of a Syrian family of six headed for a new life to Ohio had been called off. According to the Times, a young Iranian woman and her family were ordered to leave a flight that had stopped in Istanbul. \n\n \nSEE ALSO: \n \nHameed Khalid Darweesh, one of the Iraqis detained at JFK, had worked on behalf of the U.S. in Iraq for 10 years and the other, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was coming to join his wife and young son who live in Houston. \n\n \nDarweesh and his family were granted special immigrant visas, according to the lawsuit. Between 2003 and 2013, he worked for the U.S. military and two U.S. government projects. Because of his association with the U.S. Armed Forces, the lawsuit states he was directly targeted twice. To obtain the special immigrant visa, Darweesh had to obtain a Chief of Mission approval from the embassy, a lengthy process that determines whether the applicant provided a \"faithful and valuable service to the United States.\" \n \nAfter receiving COM approval in January 2015, he and his family were granted the visas on Jan. 25, 2017. The suit states that they immediately boarded a flight to the U.S. because of the sensitive and dangerous nature of Darweesh's situation. \n \nDarweesh was later released from detention. Photos posted to Twitter by New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Lydia Velazquez showed Darweesh standing with the two representatives past the passport control and customs section of the airport. \n \nAt a press conference outside the airport, Darweesh thanked those who supported him. \n \n\"This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,\" he said. \n \n\"I'm very happy, really I forget what all I faced, whatever happened to me.\" \n \nAsked by a reporter what he thought of America, Darweesh replied that \"America is the greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.\" \n \nDarweesh worked as an interpreter for Brandon Friedman, who posted a photo of the two from 2003. \n \nThe second man, Alshawi, had been given a Follow to Join Visa to be with his wife and young son. His wife worked as an accountant for a U.S. contractor in 2006, as did her brother, which made them a target for insurgents, according to the lawsuit. She applied for refugee status for her and her son in 2011 and the two currently live in the country as lawful permanent residents. \n \nAlshawi's wife, who identified herself as D to the New York Times , said their 7-year-old son did not know that his father was coming home. \n \n\u201cIt was a surprise for him,\u201d she told the Times. \n \nNew York representatives Nydia Velazquez and Jerry Nadler, went to the airport to help those being detained. Velazquez says she was told by CBP agents that they are waiting for direction from the Department of Homeland Security to act. A protest at JFK  Saturday targeted the detention. \n \nChants of  \"hey hey JFK, no more fascist USA,\" and \"no hate, no hear, Muslims are welcome here,\" could be heard coming from the crowd. Around 300 people were gathered across the street from Terminal 4 at JFK near the arrivals area and the number was swelling. \n \nSpeaking at the protest, Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in addition to Alshawi there were 10 others being detained at JFK but the organization was unable to take legal action on their behalf because their names had not been released. She called on CBP to release the names. \n \nThe lawsuit filed Saturday was the first of what is expected to be several legal challenges to Trump's executive order. The Council of Islamic Relations said on Friday that it would hold a news conference on Monday announcing the filing of a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. \n\n \nJohn Santore, Marc Torrence, Simone Wilson, Alison Bauter, Jonah Meadows, and Colin Miner contributed reporting. \n \nMain Image via Nydia Velazquez \n \nPhoto Credit: Terminal 4 at JFK by lemoncat1 via Flickr/Creative Commons","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Feroze Dhanoa"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"U.S. Judges Halt Trump's Deportations Of Dozens Held At Airports","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nassau","zipCode":"11553","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Uniondale","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Rockville Centre Patch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"172146886","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Rockville Centre Patch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.rockvillecentre.patch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-executive-order-could-block-legal-residents-from-returning-to-america","http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-visa-ban-also-applies-to-citizens-with-dual-nationality-state-department-says-1485628654?mod=e2fb","https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/825443851808669696","http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Two-Syrian-Families-Detained-at-Philadelphia-International-Airport-Told-to-Fly-Back-Family-Member-Says-412047173.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?emc=edit_na_20170128&nl=breaking-news&nlid=72675407&ref=cta","https://www.facebook.com/events/623562661169807/","https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/14062-cair-to-announce-constitutional-challenge-to-trump-s-muslim-ban-executive-order.html","https://www.flickr.com/photos/lemoncat1/"],"sequenceId":"695200467258","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T16:53:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cdn20.patch.com/users/22877259/20170128/091105/styles/T600x450/public/article_images/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1485654598-9499.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 32 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bernalillo","zipCode":"87125","state":"New Mexico","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Albuquerque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KOAT","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659419","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"169"},"name":"KOAT","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.koat.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200469534","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Donnelly ordered a halt to any removal of refugees or others who hold valid visas to enter the United States \u2014 meaning those who have arrived at U.S. airports from the seven predominantly Muslim countries named under the president\u2019s executive order can remain, for now.\n\nThe judge did not rule on the legality of the executive order, nor did she say that others who have not yet arrived in the U.S. can be allowed to proceed.\n\nThe ruling came in response to a petition filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of two Iraqis detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York: Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who was an interpreter for the U.S. military, and Haider Alshawi, who was on his way to join his wife, who had worked for a U.S. contractor in Iraq.\n\nACLU attorneys argued that returning either petitioner could cause \u201cirreparable harm\u201d by exposing them and their families to retaliation from extremists.\n\nThe two lead plaintiffs were held by authorities and threatened with deportation, even though both \u201cassert a fear of returning to their countries, and if they are not admitted pursuant to their valid entry documents, [they] seek an opportunity to pursue asylum,\u201d the lawyers argued in the emergency petition.\n\n\u201cThis ruling preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil,\" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case.\n\nThe executive order Trump signed Friday suspends all refugee entries for 120 days, blocks Syrian refugees indefinitely and bars for 90 days the entry of citizens from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia.\n\nWhile the court did not take on the legal merits of that action, the judge\u2019s order said the Trump administration and its employees are \u201cenjoined and restrained from the commission of further acts of and misconduct in violation of the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe petitioners have a strong likelihood of success in establishing that the removal of the petitioner and others similarly situated violates their rights to Due Process and Equal Protection guaranteed under the United States Constitution,\u201d the court ruled.\n\nSurrounded by a throng of cheering demonstrators, who had rushed from Kennedy airport to the Brooklyn courthouse, an exultant Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU, said, ``This was a remarkable day. What we\u2019ve shown today is that the courts can work. They are a bulwark in our democracy when President Trump enacts laws or executive order that are unconstitutional and illegal.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn a separate case, a federal judge in Virginia ruled preliminarily in favor of three legal permanent residents and at least 60 others detained under Trump's executive order at Dulles International Airport.\n\nU.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema late Saturday issued an order barring immigration officials for at least a week from deporting lawful permanent residents detained at Dulles, outside Washington. She also ordered immigration officials to allow lawyers access to those detainees.\n\nThe New York order appears to affect the 100 to 200 people who have been detained in transit to the United States. While the order will prevent them from being sent home, it is less clear whether they will have to remain in detention while their asylum cases are being decided.\n\nDarweesh was released earlier Saturday.\n\nThousands of New Yorkers had rushed to Kennedy airport, which is located in Queens within the court\u2019s jurisdiction, earlier in the day to protest the detention of the passengers.\n\nKaren Tumlin, Los Angeles-based legal director of the National Immigration Law Center, said she was \"incredibly relieved\" by the stay.\n\nShe said lawyers were contacting federal immigration officials late Saturday to ensure the stay is enforced.\n\n\"There are people on planes at different airports to be removed, so we're trying to get the word out to Border Protection,\" Tumlin said, noting that the stay applies to everyone affected by the executive order. She said the judge specified from the bench that the stay is nationwide.\n\n\"That doesn't mean they have the ability to move freely in the United States,\" Tumlin said of those detained, although she said her group plans to argue that they should.\n\nWhile Tumlin said access to counsel for all those affected by the executive order is a concern going forward, \"my chief concern is that nobody is sent back where they can be harmed.\"\n\nShe said dozens were detained at JFK, at least 50 Iranians from one KLM flight were held at Los Angeles International Airport, and more than a dozen were held at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.\n\n\"I would hope that this means they will all be safe,\" she said. \"But we will have to be vigilant.\"\n\nHave the women\u2019s marches started a movement?

Trump and his team insisted the order was not intended to target Islam and its followers, but the hashtag #muslimban trended, and many Muslims both in America and abroad said they viewed the measure as a broadly conceived and stinging exclusion.\n\nCapping a day of high-stakes drama, a federal judge in New York, Ann M. Donnelly, ordered a halt to deportations of travelers who arrived at airports with valid visas to enter the U.S., saying that sending them back to the affected countries could cause them \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d But she did not rule on the legality of the executive order, nor did she say that others who have not yet arrived in the U.S. can be allowed to proceed.\n\nOpponents of the president\u2019s directive vowed to seek a wider court win. Lawyers from groups including the American Civil Liberties Union said they intended to press ahead with efforts to overturn the president\u2019s overall order on constitutional grounds. And they rejoiced at their early victory.\n\n\u201cClearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country,\u201d said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero. \u201cOn week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d\n\nIn a separate and more limited ruling, a federal judge in Virginia ordered a weeklong stay against removing people with permanent U.S. residency who had been detained under the presidential order at Washington Dulles International Airport.\n\nAs the directive\u2019s effects spread, thousands staged spontaneous protests against refugee detention at airports across the country, including in Los Angeles and San Francisco. At New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, demonstrators waved signs and read from the famous Emma Lazarus poem inscribed in the Statue of Liberty.\n\nAt more than a dozen airports, including Los Angeles, Newark, Boston, Dallas, Chicago and Atlanta, immigration attorneys stepped up in droves to offer free services to those detained. \u201cA lot of tears and emotion here,\u201d said Hassan Ahmad, a lawyer from northern Virginia who hustled to Dulles airport.\n\nThe New York order appeared to affect the 100 to 200 people who were detained in transit to the United States. While the order will prevent them from being sent home, it was less clear whether they will have to remain in detention while their asylum cases are being decided.\n\nOne of the two detained Iraqis named in the case, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was an interpreter who had worked on behalf of the U.S. government. Freed after 19 hours in custody, he wept as he spoke to reporters, thanking supporters and calling America \u201cthe land of freedom, the land of rights.\u201d\n\nThe groups bringing the legal challenge, who also included the International Refugee Assistance Project and the National Immigration Law Center, said a separate motion sets the stage for a larger action involving other would-be refugees, visitors and immigrants stopped at other ports of entry.\n\nArab American advocacy groups also were reacting to the new order, warning that it was disrupting travel all over the world.\n\n\u201cWe see complete chaos in the way this has been implemented,\u201d Abed A. Ayoub, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said in a conference call with reporters.\n\nThe directive, he said, had caught up not only desperate refugees who had thought themselves within a hairsbreadth of safety, but many more with already established lives, homes and families in the United States. \u201cThis order needs to be rescinded,\u201d he said.\n\nIn another legal challenge, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would file a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the order. The suit, to be filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Virginia, argues that the executive order is unconstitutional because of its apparent aim of singling out Muslims.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that refugees \u2014 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2014 are a threat to national security,\u201d the group\u2019s national litigation director, Lena F. Masri, said in a statement. \u201cThis is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\u201d\n\nThe order, signed Friday by Trump during a visit to the Pentagon, suspends all refugee entries for 120 days. In addition, it indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees and bars entry to the U.S. for 90 days for those traveling from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nProminent Muslim figures raised their voices in opposition to the temporary refugee ban, saying children would be among those suffering the most from it.\n\nNobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by the Taliban, said in a statement that she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d that Trump was closing the door on \u201cchildren, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said the travel ban also covered holders of green cards, who are authorized to live and work in the U.S. Some reports have put the number of such permanent residents from the affected countries as high as half a million.\n\nAn administration official said that current green card holders from the affected countries would be allowed to remain in the U.S. \u2014 but that those caught outside the country at the time of the ban\u2019s imposition would have to be allowed back in on a case-by-case basis. Those with business overseas will have to meet beforehand with a consular official.\n\nThe measure\u2019s scope was also widened by a State Department announcement that dual nationals from the seven affected countries who also held passports from third countries such as Britain or Canada could be blocked \u2014 in effect denying U.S. entry to citizens of closely allied nations.\n\nAs the measure\u2019s far-reaching impact became clear, and the airport chaos mounted throughout the day, Trump denied it was a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and said the process was going smoothly. \u201cWe were totally prepared,\u201d he told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely, and we\u2019re going to have a very, very strict ban.\u201d\n\nThe move has hit the technology industry, which employs thousands of foreign-born workers, many from Muslim-majority countries. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai on Friday slammed Trump\u2019s executive order in a memo to employees, saying about 100 employees were affected, and advising those traveling abroad to reach out to the company\u2019s immigration teams for assistance.\n\nInvestors and start-up employees are worried as well. Tech workers from countries such as Egypt and Jordan fear the list could soon expand to include their countries.\n\nThe entertainment world felt repercussions, too. It\u2019s uncertain whether Iranian filmmaker and Oscar nominee Asghar Farhadi will be able to attend next month\u2019s Academy Awards ceremony, though there are artistic waivers to the ban.\n\nRelatives wondered when they would see loved ones again. Iranian American Milad Sharifpour, a physician at Emory University in Atlanta, was worried for his brother, Ali Reza, a green card holder who was in Tehran visiting family when the directive took effect. \u201cI am sad, I\u2019m upset, and I feel very frustrated,\u201d Sharifpour said.\n\nMany feared that what they intended as temporary trips abroad could become prolonged ordeals. A Syrian clarinetist who lives in New York and holds permanent U.S. residency was in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, for a concert when the order took effect.\n\nIt left him unsure whether he would be able to go back to his Brooklyn apartment, he said, \u201clet alone all the concerts and residencies I have in the U.S. in the coming few months.\u201d\n\nHe asked not to be identified, because he will soon be trying to return to the U.S.\n\n\u201cI am not sure how to describe how I feel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is certainly not about me; it is about so many individuals whose lives were deeply affected.\u201d The United Nations human rights agency issued a statement calling the long-standing U.S. refugee resettlement program \u201cone of the most important in the world.\u201d It called on the Trump administration to ensure the U.S. \u201cwill continue its strong leadership role and long tradition of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race,\u201d the group said.\n\nAcross the United States, refugee advocates scrambled to ascertain the status of those who were already en route or about to leave when the order came down. A total of 30 refugees were scheduled to arrive in Atlanta next week from Somalia, Afghanistan, Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nAll had gone through months of security checks.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d said J.D. McCrary, executive director of the International Rescue Committee\u2019s Atlanta office. \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with anything like this ever happening on such a mass scale in the entire history of this program. Slamming the door on those fleeing persecution is deeply un-American.\u201d\n\nIn Congress, reaction to the immigration chaos tended to break down along party lines, with vociferous criticism from Democrats while Republicans largely remained silent.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Trump had chosen a \u201cdark path,\u201d while both Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco said the Statue of Liberty would have wept.\n\nOne of the few Republicans to speak out against the directive was Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who said the order could play into the hands of jihadist groups by being excessively sweeping in nature.\n\n\u201cWhile not technically a Muslim ban, this order is too broad,\u201d Sasse said in a statement.\n\nAirports overseas and in the U.S. found themselves at ground zero for the spreading chaos. Five members of one Iraqi family, along with a Yemeni, were prevented from boarding flights in Cairo.\n\nAt the Frankfurt airport in Germany, a major hub for travel from the Middle East and onward to Europe and the U.S., more were stranded. A German radio network quoted federal police as saying that 20 people from all seven countries on the list were stuck in the airport\u2019s transit zone, unable to board flights for the U.S.\n\nIn Atlanta, a growing cluster of family members and lawyers gathered Saturday at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after at least five permanent U.S. residents who had traveled to Iran on vacation were detained by federal immigration officials.\n\nMansour Kenareh, 55, an Iranian software engineer who lives in Suwanee, Ga., said his brother-in law, his wife and their 10-year-old child had been detained after returning from a vacation in Tehran to visit family.\n\n\"They have green cards, they have bank accounts, they have a house here,\" Kenareh said as he paced the arrivals hall of the international terminal after an unfruitful visit to a Customs and Border Protection office. Officials, he said, had detained the family for more than five hours, even though they had lived legally in the U.S. for more than a year. \n\nSarah Owings, an immigration attorney, said that she had not been allowed to meet with the detained immigrants at the Atlanta airport. \n\n\u201cThese are people who live here; they have houses, they have dogs, cars,\u201d Owings said. \"This should not be happening. They can't send back a permanent resident without a hearing.\"\n\nLate Saturday, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said that all 11 people who were detained at the airport had been cleared and released.\n\nIn Europe, there was blowback from U.S. allies, who have absorbed a wave of refugees over the last two years and are already deeply unhappy with Trump for disparaging the NATO alliance and predicting the breakup of the European Union.\n\n\u201cWhen he rejects the arrival of refugees while Europe has done its duty, we should respond to him,\u201d said French President Francois Hollande.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, well aware of Trump\u2019s evangelical Christian base of support, said pointedly, \u201c\u2018Love thy neighbor\u2019 is part of this tradition, the act of helping others.\u201d\n\nOn social media, users bemoaned what they said was a blow to what remained of the world\u2019s respect for American ideals.\n\n\u201cFascism USA 2017,\u201d tweeted Mona Eltahawy, an Egyptian American author and activist.\n\nThe prospect of reciprocal measures was raised almost immediately \u2014 a factor that could potentially affect Americans including aid workers, tourists and business travelers. Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry, condemning Trump\u2019s order, said Saturday that Iran \u201creserves the right of reciprocity,\u201d official outlets reported.\n\nTrump\u2019s move could also dampen hopes for negotiating the release of U.S. citizens held in any of the affected countries. Several Americans of Iranian descent are imprisoned in Iran on spy charges.\n\nSo-called sanctuary cities were once places of refuge.

Nadal saved one but not the next as a thundering serve sent the match to a decider. \n \nNadal raced out of the blocks, opening up three break points in the first game, but failed to convert, and then it was Dimitrov\u2019s turn, a stinging backhand down the line giving him 30-40 but Nadal also held on. \n \nThere were two more break points apiece before finally Dimitrov submitted at 4-4. Nadal whipped away a forehand pass, hunted down Dimitrov\u2019s retrieval and drove it down the line for the break. \n \nServing for the match, Nadal delivered an ace for match point, called out but shown to have nicked the line on review. Dimitrov saved one with an ice-cool smash and then another with a blistering forehand. \n \nA third match point proved beyond him, however, as a weary backhand drifted past the baseline. Nadal fell to his knees in celebration after an enthralling four hours and 56 minutes.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Nadal sets up Federer final","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"LK","country":"Sri Lanka"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Sri Lanka Sunday Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169829571","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"266"},"name":"Sri Lanka Sunday Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thesundayleader.lk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200485382","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:53:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.thesundayleader.lk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Nadal-Pg23-4th-lead-PIX.png"}],"video":[]}}

Italy, as ever, are the tournament outsiders. \n \nIn the 2016 tournament, England completed a first Six Nations Grand Slam since 2003 by beating France 31-21 in Paris. \n \nIn Eddie Jones\u2019 first campaign as head coach, the Red Rose bounced back from their World Cup failure under Stuart Lancaster in the best way possible by ending a run of four successive runners-up placings in the tournament by claiming victories over Scotland, Italy, Ireland, Wales and finally France to achieve a clean sweep. \n \nWales ended up runners-up this time, with defending champions Ireland having to settle for third place ahead of Scotland. Italy took the wooden spoon. \n \nThe RBS 6 Nations title launched Jones\u2019 regime with Twickenham\u2019s first silverware for five years and by the end of 2016 the Australian had presided over a sequence of 13 successive Test victories. \n \nEngland are now second in the global rankings and the next stage on their mission to supplant New Zealand at the pinnacle of the sport is to rid themselves of any conservatism against their European rivals. \n \n\u201cYou don\u2019t defend a Grand Slam, you\u2019ve got to win it again and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to be absolutely daring going into the Six Nations,\u201d Jones said. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a big part of how we want to develop our game because we want to be a side that has the courage to play our sort of rugby from the very first game of the tournament. \n \n\u201cFor the first couple of games last year we were quite reticent to play any rugby. We got better against Ireland and Wales and then went back into our shell against France. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s the challenge ahead. We\u2019ve got a short period of time to change mindsets but I think we can do that.\u201d \n \nThis year\u2019s Six Nations will also see the introduction of a bonus-point system \u2013 details of which as follows: \n \nPoints System (including bonus details) \n \n\u2022FOUR points awarded for a win \n \n\u2022TWO points awarded for a draw \n \n\u2022NO points awarded for a loss \n \n\u2022ONE bonus point awarded for scoring four tries or more \n \n\u2022ONE bonus point awarded if a team loses a match by seven points or less \n \n\u2022THREE bonus points if a team wins all five of their matches \n \n  \n \nTherefore a winning team can gain a maximum of five points while a losing team can still earn up to two points. The maximum total number of points a team can win over the tournament is 28 (5×5 plus three Grand Slam bonus points).","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Coach Jones Wants Bold Approach As England Defend Crown","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"LK","country":"Sri Lanka"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Sri Lanka Sunday Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169829571","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"266"},"name":"Sri Lanka Sunday Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thesundayleader.lk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200485543","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:58:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.thesundayleader.lk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rugby-Pg23-2nd-lead-PIX.png"}],"video":[]}}

The amount of preparatory work I do for class has been multiplied, from looking over texts I haven\u2019t read in years to converting my old lecture notes to the formats and technologies I now use. It\u2019s been exhausting ... and exhilarating. \n \nThe feeling is not unlike visiting someplace where I used to live or work \u2014 that pleasant nostalgia of returning to favorite places. I find myself smiling or laughing with delight quite often lately. It\u2019s as if I were attending a reunion with old friends and reminiscing over old times. \n \nThe feeling has crept into other aspects of my life. The perpetual de-cluttering of my house \u2014 that project that never seems to be finished \u2014 has slowed as I \u201cre-discover\u201d things I should have tossed many years ago ... and then remember why I didn\u2019t. Shifting books around on the shelves the other night, I found a popular book from a few years ago and was about to toss it in the \u201ctrade pile.\u201d It needed reading when it was popular, but I can\u2019t imagine that I\u2019ll ever want to read it again. \n \nThen it hit me why I kept it in the first place. I had given it as a gift to my mother. She gave it back to me and told me how much she enjoyed it and that I should read it. It\u2019s the only book I have that she and I both read. Not just the same \u201cbook,\u201d but the same BOOK \u2014 we both read the same physical copy. Back on the shelf it went. I\u2019ll probably re-read it again, too. \n \nThese little voyages of re-discovery set off in uncharted waters, too, which is counter-intuitive. Usually, \u201cre-discovery\u201d means that the voyage covers familiar waters, someplace the voyager has been, even if not in a while. This \u201cun-charting\u201d and \u201cre-charting\u201d of the charted has taken the form of re-watching favorite old movies. Sometime around New Year\u2019s Day, for example, I got that 1942 movie \u201cNow, Voyager\u201d on my mind and dug out my copy of it. Before watching, I remembered that I\u2019d bought a copy of the novel by Olive Higgins Prouty on which the movie is based. It was in the \u201cto-read\u201d pile, so I dug it out and read it before watching the film. \n \nThe whole experience was a real hoot. Frankly, \u201cNow, Voyager\u201d is not the best movie ever made; it\u2019s not even the best Bette Davis movie ever made (it may be the best movie Bette Davis ever made with Paul Henreid and Claude Rains, though). It is a wonderful and memorable movie, worthy of far more recognition that it now has. The treat of the movie as compared to the book is watching Bette Davis go from frumpy, dowdy spinster to chic, sophisticated socialite in a few minutes. The treat of the book as compared to the movie is finding out more about why the transformation occurs. \n \nI don\u2019t remember when I first saw the movie. It was either back when local television stations used to show the classics late at night, or on Turner Classic Movies, which is the 24 hours-per-day version of that. What I do remember is that I didn\u2019t focus in on that aspect of the movie then, but I did now. Perhaps that\u2019s the true definition of a classic, whether it be book or movie \u2014 every time a classic is experienced, it is a NEW experience, no matter how often it is RE-experienced. Those waters aren\u2019t \u201cun-charted\u201d or \u201cre-charted\u201d as much as they are simply \u201cun-chartable.\u201d \n \nDigging \u201cNow, Voyager\u201d out of the to-read pile uncovered the novel under it \u2014 Vera Caspary\u2019s \u201cLaura,\u201d which was filmed as a now-classic murder mystery movie. Y\u2019all know where this one is going ... and there went my weekend. \u201cLaura\u201d is a true classic and one of my favorites, so when Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney flickered on-screen, I knew exactly the waters I was about to sail, but I saw things in it this viewing that I never noticed before. I\u2019m sailing the novel right now. \n \nWhat was next to the DVD of \u201cLaura?\u201d The classic western \u201cDestry Rides Again\u201d with Jimmy Stewart and Marlene Dietrich. I saddled up and watched it again. I think this old favorite was based on a Max Brand novel, but I don\u2019t have it. Come to think of it, Madeline Kahn\u2019s character in the Mel Brooks classic Western comedy \u201cBlazing Saddles\u201d is a parody of Marlene Dietrich\u2019s performance in \u201cDestry Rides Again.\u201d Of course, Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder are brilliant in \u201cBlazing Saddles,\u201d and I\u2019ve got a copy of it around here somewhere ... \n \nThis is why I never get the house de-cluttered. \n \nDavid Murdock is an English instructor at Gadsden State Community College.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 36 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Baltimore City","zipCode":"21211","state":"Maryland","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Baltimore","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WBAL Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659774","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"477"},"name":"WBAL Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wbaltv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200493545","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\u201cMr. President, look at us,\u201d said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \u201cThis is America. What you have done is shameful.

No wall!\u201d \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\u201d \n \nAirport arrests \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov.

JULIA SUMERLING No wooden hulls were found, most likely having been destroyed by the passage of time. \n\nThe expedition was a collaboration between Silentworld and the Australian National Maritime Museum.\n\nANMM maritime archaeology curator James Hunter said the next, and more difficult step, would be identifying the wrecks.\n\n\"This will take months of careful examination of the archaeological discoveries against historical records, including ship's logs and accounts of shipwrecks in newspapers from the period,\u201d Dr Hunter said.\n\n\"It's an amazing feeling to look down through the water at an anchor and know that we're likely the first people in over 150 years to set eyes on these ships...albeit what remains of them.\u201d\n\nDISCOVERY: The expedition was a joint venture between the Silentworld Foundation and the Australian National Maritime Museum.

JULIA SUMERLING The majority of wrecks along Kenn Reefs are 19th century trading vessels on their way north to places like India and Indonesia.\n\nKenn Reefs is part of the underwater geological feature called the Kenn Plateau and covers about 42sqkm. \n\nIt's not the first time the Silentworld team has struck gold in its mission.\n\nIn January 2009 the team found and identified the colonial government schooner Mermaid wrecked in 1829, 20km south of Cairns, and in 2012 found the Royal Charlotte, wrecked on Frederick Reef in 1825.\n\nPhotos View Photo Gallery SILENTWORLD\n\nThe 40m luxury vessel was built in Spain in 2006.The yacht can take up to 12 people and eight crew. Features include a full-size jacuzzi, sun deck with teak lounges, cherry wood floors in the main salon and upper deck, marble floors in the bathrooms, a VIP cabin on the upper deck, two seabobs, ski tubes, wakeboards, paddleboards, kayaks, snorkelling and scuba equipment and fishing gear.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Research team finds four shipwrecks after leaving Bundy","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"NewsMail","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662480","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"11"},"name":"NewsMail","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news-mail.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200505969","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://media.apnarm.net.au/img/media/images/2017/01/29/b88557782z1_20170129175458_000garg495n2-0-4w7t2a60552s4w3jnn2_ct300x300.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Federer, 35, and Nadal, 30 are once again at it. Both men, who rouse nostalgia, are in a Major final. The Swiss and the Spaniard will be facing in the Australian Open men\u2019s final on Sunday. It is a tough one to predict. First and foremost, there is not a lot that has separated the two players as far as hard courts are concerned. \n \nWhile Nadal has been clearly the better player on clay, the grass would have favoured Federer\u2019s game. That equation of dominance does not stand with respect to hard courts. No player can claim that he will dominate his great rival and opponent on a hard court because the man at the other side of the net is equally capable on the same surface. \n \nHere are 10 key stats ahead of the big final: \n \n1) Federer has won 17 Majors, Nadal has bagged 14 Majors \n2) Federer will be playing his 28th Major final, Nadal will be in his 21st Major final \n3) Federer is looking for his fifth Australian Open title, Nadal for his second Australian Open crown \n4) This will be Federer\u2019s sixth Australian Open final, it will be Nadal\u2019s fourth \n5) Federer has won more Majors than anyone else, Nadal is tied for the second spot with Pete Sampras \n6) Nadal leads the head-to-head record against Federer at 23-11 \n7) In Majors, Nadal leads Federer 9-2 \n8) In Major finals, Nadal leads Federer 6-2 \n9) At the Australian Open, Nadal leads Federer 3-0 \n10) Both have contested at an Australian Open final only once before. It was in 2009 when Nadal won 7\u20135, 3\u20136, 7\u20136 (7\u20133), 3\u20136, 6\u20132 \n \nNadal leads Federer 13-2 on clay. More importantly, Nadal has won the French Open nine times. Federer has won in France only once. On grass, the two have met only three times. Federer leads 2-1. And significantly, Federer has won Wimbledon seven times. Nadal on the other hand has won there twice. \n \nOn hard courts, it is really close with Nadal leading Federer 9-7. On the other hand, Federer has won nine Majors on hard courts (five in the US and four in Australia). Nadal has bagged three Majors on hard courts (two in the US and one in Australia). \n \nBoth have not played a Major final in six years. They last played at the French Open in 2011 when Nadal won 7\u20135, 7\u20136 (7\u20133), 5\u20137, 6\u20131.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sattwik Biswal"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Australian Open 2017, Live updates: Roger Federer vs Rafael Nadal, Men\u2019s singles final","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"India.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597540856","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"India.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.india.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200509083","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:54:29Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://s3.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fedal-700.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

There must be positive comprehensive gold policy and I believe it is so important for economy that so many people are dependent on it,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cCrores of rupees are traded in the market and so many consumers, so many are producers, and from the linkage it to financial sector is increasing. Therefore, it is time for the government to think of White Paper on positive comprehensive policy for gold,\u201d Reddy said in his speech titled \u2018Gold \u2013 Black, White and Yellow\u2019. \n \nHe said in 2015-16, for the \u201cfirst time\u201d there was some positive signal with regard to gold from the government\u2019s side. \n \nAccording to Reddy, launching of a gold scheme and making PAN number compulsory for purchases of gold jewellery worth more than Rs 2 lakh shows the seriousness of government in making the making gold a commodity. \n \n\u201cWe also found that the gold jewellers were asked to provide PAN details of consumers who bought jewellery worth more than Rs 2 lakh so that it can be tracked. Recognition of gold as commodity or something is important that the public policy cannot ignore. These are signs of positive policy,\u201d he opined. \n \nRecalling the experiences faced by the Centre in 1990 on BoP crisis, he said the government had very little gold of its own and most of the metal put out in the international market was seized from smugglers. \n \n\u201cGovernment of India had leased gold to SBI (during 1990 crisis). How did the Government of India come into possession of gold? Most of the gold was confiscated from smugglers. So the smuggled gold, the confiscate gold came handy,\u201d Reddy said. \n \n\u201cSmugglers also helped us to get over the BoP crisis,\u201d he said in a lighter vein. \n \nHe maintained that gold is the ultimate currency in the world, though domestically possessing it is part of Indian culture and for women it acts like insurance. \n \nThis is published unedited from the PTI feed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Time to come out with comprehensive gold policy: Y V Reddy","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"India.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597540856","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"India.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.india.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200509344","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:56:08Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://s3.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/indiacom-image-banner_06.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

In fact, one in particular: B3, or niacin. \n \nResearchers led by Mathilde Tissier at the University of Strasbourg had set out to determine whether hamster diet affects their ability to reproduce in the wild. \n \n\n \nEarlier work had looked at the impact of pesticides and mechanised ploughing, which can destroy their underground homes, especially during hibernation in winter. \n \nBut the possible link with what they eat remained unexplored. \n \nA first set of lab experiments with wild specimens compared wheat and corn-based diets, with side dishes of clover or worms. \n \nThere was virtually no difference in the number of pups born, or the basic nutritional value of the different menus. \n \nOur hamster habitat is collapsing \n \nScientist Gerard Baumgart \n \nBut when it came to survival rates, the difference was dramatic. \n \nAbout four-fifths of the pups born of mothers feasting on wheat-and-clover or wheat-and-worms were weaned. \n \nOnly five per cent, however, of the baby hamsters whose mothers ate corn instead of wheat made it that far. \n \nWhat was most disturbing is how they perished. \n \nDon\u2019t feel so sorry for the male black widow spider: he has an awful sex habit, too \n \n\u201cFemales stored their pups with their hoards of maize before eating them,\u201d the scientists reported. \u201cPups were still alive at that time.\u201d \n \nThe cannibal mothers showed other signs of abnormality. \n \nThe usually cute-and-cuddly hamsters ran in circles, \u201cclimbing and pounding their feeders,\u201d when scientists entered the room. \n \nThe females also had swollen and dark tongues, and blood so thick it was difficult to draw for samples. \n \nThe researchers recognised the symptoms, and had a hunch as to what was causing them. \n \nVitamin B3 deficiency has been linked to \u2018black-tongue\u2019 syndrome in dogs, and a condition in humans called pellagra, also known as the \u201c3-D\u201d disease: diarrhoea, dementia and dermatitis, such as eczema. \n \n\u201cImproperly cooked maize-based diets have been associated with higher rates of homicide, suicide and cannibalism in humans,\u201d the researchers note. \n \nPellagra is thought to have decimated some three million people in North America and Europe from the mid-18th to the mid-20th century. \n \nThe dire consequences of the B3-deficient corn diet, the scientists concluded, stemmed not from reduced maternal hormones, but rather a change in the nervous system that induced the same \u201cdementia-like\u201d behaviour diagnosed in humans.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Agriculture news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"France news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Corn may be turning French hamsters into deranged cannibals","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Eastern Asia","countryCode":"HK","country":"Hong Kong"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"South China Morning Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169685908","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"216"},"name":"South China Morning Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.scmp.com","publisher":"South China Morning Post Publishers"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200512695","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:57:08Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/140x87/public/images/methode/2017/01/29/463043e0-e5f6-11e6-8801-9f557f980a64_image_hires.jpg?itok=5zMl6sqW"}],"video":[]}}

We have a squad of 17 girls at the moment which is really, really good,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe had nine or 10 girls play over the weekend, and it's been really pleasing to see how the new girls in the group. We have some girls from Portland who had never played with the group before.\n\n\u201cIt was good for them to get some games with the girls to really get into our style of basketball and how we want to play. \u201cFrom our point of view, this weekend was a good success for us. Losing the final was disappointing but we won every other game.\u201d\n\nBrown said good performances at the carnival meant Mermaids coaching staff would have selection headaches when it was time to trim the squad to 12.\n\n\u201cAll of the girls stood up and performed at some stage throughout the carnival. They are very promising signs and will make my job very difficult,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBecause the season doesn\u2019t start until March 18 we have a month and half of pre-season and at the moment, we\u2019re training twice and doing a fitness session once a week.\n\n\u201cBecause we have so many new girls too we just need to play together and to get used to each other so we\u2019re fit and ready to go from round one.\u201d\n\nShe earmarked youngster Taylah Nelson as one of the Mermaids\u2019 most promising youngsters for the upcoming season.\n\nBrown also conceded the return of Holly Green from Melbourne would be a godsend for the side.\n\n\u201cTaylah could play in a guard-type position \u2013 not quite a point guard \u2013 but she is a very nice shooter,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a very exciting junior and is quite raw but has a lot of potential. \n\n\u201cHolly is another who is great to have in Mermaids colours again. She\u2019s had a short break from the game but you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell.\u201d The Warrnambool Seahawks \u2013 led by playing coach Matt Alexander \u2013 were unable to get the job done on the back of success in the pool games.

Raees was already a well-researched story by two journalists, but Rahul wanted to give it a spin to make it more than just a niche movie. I normally play more urban characters. It was interesting for me to go into this space to play a character which is within my repertoire, but still a little different. I have never played this kind of a small-town and earthy character. I found it very intriguing how bootleggers in the \u201980s and \u201990s bypassed restrictions. We have studied a lot of cases for this film and it\u2019s in a very Narcos and Breaking Bad space. \n \nDo you enjoy gangster movies? \n \nI like some gangster movies, but I am not crazy about them. I like Narcos. I liked The Godfather while I was growing up. I have never done a gangster movie, so to speak. But this was interesting as it has a touch of reality. Some of these were real case studies. \n \nDo your recent choice of films such as Fan, Dear Zindagi and now Raees, indicate a shift? \n \nNo. This is just coincidental that these three films released last year. I have never shifted from where I am. I have always done movies like this. Now, people look at the time period and say, \u201cOh, this is what he is doing\u201d. We are very quick to judge and analyse. I have been here for so long that people have forgotten my last 15 years during which I did Baazigar, Darr, Ashoka, Paheli, Swades and My Name is Khan. I have always tried to do a mix if it is available. If it is not, then you have to do what you have to do. It is a job. In my mind, I have done semi-commercial or middle-of-the-road movies like Chalte Chalte and Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani. I have failed very often trying to do different things. Then I try to do a more popular film by making an event film like Dilwale, Happy New Year, Ra.One or Chennai Express. \n \nShah Rukh In His Gangster Avatar Has The Audience Charmed  \n \nI had finished Happy New Year and shooting for Raees was supposed to start. But I was injured and we had to postpone the film. Fan was scheduled to release even before Dilwale, but we realised that the VFX would take 11 months and it got delayed. Dear Zindagi was a commitment I had made to Gauri Shinde three years ago, since I had loved the story. Normally, I try to make a movie in the popular space and a second one which can say new things within my scheme of thinking as an actor. It is by chance that these three movies came out within a year. \n\n \nA recent blog said you have sent out a \u2018brave message\u2019 by playing Muslim characters in three back-to-back films. And before that, I played 55 Hindu characters. \n   \nThough the premise of Fan was great, do you think it suffered from the post-interval curse? \n \nWe did not sit down and analyse the second half. It was an expensive film and we tried to have a wider reach. We have been wanting to make this film for seven-eight years and waited till we worked out the VFX. Maybe, what went wrong in the film is when Gaurav starts asking : \u2018Ek baar sorry keh de.\u2019 I could be completely wrong, but at this point you don\u2019t know who to go with \u2014 you may think the star should have given in. Suppose he did say sorry, would Gaurav start watching his films and loving him back? We should have retained the fact that this fan takes being shunned by the star very angrily. I do all my film with lots of love and care. It was quite a schizophrenic film, but Fan was extremely close to my heart. For Maneesh (Sharma, director) and Adi (Chopra, producer), it was a brave film. I am always disappointed when I let down people. So many people wanted to be entertained by the film. It will take me some time to get over this. \n \n © Provided by Screen  Has music taken a backseat in your films now? \n \nIt depends on the genre and the filmmaker. You can\u2019t have that in a move like Fan. If I have to keep on putting songs like Gerua in every film, there will be another set of fans who will believe that he keeps putting the same kind of music in his films. Happy New Year had an over-the-top kind of score, Jabra Fan was an interesting track too. In Raees, though, you can\u2019t put a lot of singing and dancing. \n \nHow much of a conflict is it for you to stick to popular parameters while doing \u2018realistic\u2019 movie like Raees? \n \nIt is not easy at all. Rahul wanted to make Raees in a way that doesn\u2019t hurt either of the two genres (realistic and commercial cinema). If I have to make a popular movie, I will go all out and make a Happy New Year. I believe every movie has its own space. You can\u2019t popularize Dear Zindagi by putting two songs of mine. That\u2019s silly and uneducated. In Happy New Year, you can put as many songs as you like and flaunt six-packs. We did not try to commercialize Fan, but the attempt was to have cat-and-mouse-like chase sequences to give the audience an adrenaline rush. Of course, it neither made space for critical acclaim or popular cinema. \n \nOf late, you have been sporting your salt-and-pepper beard with panache. \n \nEven in my upcoming film, directed by Imtiaz Ali, where I play a Punjabi character, I sport a beard because Imtiaz wanted it. If my next film demands me to be clean-shaven or bald, I would go for that look. \n \nSo, you are saying these are not attempts to look closer to your age? \n \nYou can put this as a headline: Shamelessly, I will keep playing a 25-year-old. Are you trying to figure out if I am settling into my age now? No. I am completely unsettled about it. Growing a beard does not make me older. It makes me sexier. I am doing it only for a film. I am shooting 400 days a year. So I am always in a hairstyle and look that the role demands. The look also won\u2019t be a reflection of what my state of mind is. \n   \nAbRam has been running around Mehboob Studio throughout the day. How often does he accompany you? \n \nSince Mehboob Studio is close to home, he drops in when I am here. Also, Gauri had to meet someone outside Mumbai today. There are so many lovely girls from the marketing and publicity teams here. He knows them and is fond of them. There are some cocks and hens roaming in the studio premises, he loves playing with them. Since he has not joined a formal school yet, he can accompany me. \n  © IANS  \nAfter Meryl Streep\u2019s fiery speech at the Golden Globe awards, there was a lot of talk about Indian celebrities, especially film personalities, not speaking up. \n \nAfter Meryl Streep\u2019s speech, asking me why Indian actors are not doing the same is weird. It is like asking me suddenly why I am not playing golf like Tiger Woods. I appreciate what she said and think it was very brave of her to say that in an event organised by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Our actors do speak. So do our actresses, filmmakers, producers and journalists. \n \nBut the bottom-line is, you\u2019ve got to speak to people who understand what you are saying. More than the platform Streep used for speaking, she had the platform where people understood what she said... Like I have said before, journalists are not used to stardom \u2014 theirs as well as celebrities\u2019. Suddenly, everybody looks better, does better make-up and the anchor is the star of every show. The editor is the star of every snippet. Everybody writes an article with a picture. Everybody is trying to lose weight, look nice. When I was seven years into stardom, I used to behave like this. \n \nI am waiting for media persons to get over their wonderful, newly-gained stardom. I am friends with most of them and really want to ask them: why do you want to join the bandwagon of faceless people on social media who just want to say a thing and become famous? You don\u2019t need to do that. You used to present the point of view of people, so that I can take your opinion, other people\u2019s opinion, and decide what\u2019s happening around the world. You are the first source of knowledge about what\u2019s happening... \n \nWhy would you say that I wish Indian actors spoke like this (Streep)? Can I say I wish Indian journalists presented me like that too? Is that fair? Give me a platform where you present my point of view, not as part of the agenda you have in your storyline. I would speak \u2014 I always did, I always will.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: celebrity gossip","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Shamelessly, I will keep playing a 25-year-old: Shah Rukh Khan","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"CA","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"MSN Canada","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657344","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"MSN Canada","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ca.msn.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200517695","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And if the Falcons prevail, Webster\u2019s favorite son will be former South Sumter High School and University of Florida standout Keanu Neal. \n \nNeal, a rookie defensive back with Atlanta, will put the finishing touches on a storybook rookie season in the world\u2019s biggest football game this year. The 17th overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft, Neal has helped transform the Falcons\u2019 defensive unit from a liability into an asset. \n \nHeading into the Super Bowl, Neal has made 106 tackles, despite missing the Falcons\u2019 first two games with a knee injury. Neal also forced five fumbles, which is an NFL record for rookies. \n \n\u201cIt feels almost surreal right now,\u201d Neal said on Tuesday. \u201cI mean every boy dreams of playing in the Super Bowl and I\u2019m actually going to do it. It seems like only yesterday that I was watching my brother (former NFL defensive back Clint Hart) playing for the San Diego Chargers against guys like Tom Brady and now I\u2019m getting ready to play against him in the biggest game of my life. \n \n\u201cSurreal.\u201d \n \nWhile playing in the Super Bowl seems like a dream to Neal, it doesn\u2019t surprise anyone who has known him for years and watched him grow up and mature. \n \n\u201cThe only thing that surprises me is that he\u2019s playing in the Super Bowl at the age of 21,\u201d said former South Sumter football coach Inman Sherman. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised Keanu\u2019s playing in the Super Bowl \u2026 just that he got there so quickly. He is the best student athlete we put out at South Sumter while I was at the school. A 1-in-100 kid, the total package. No one ever outworked him on the football field, in the weight room, or in the classroom.\u201d \n \nSherman said Neal derives his work ethic from his parents, Kathy Hart Neal and Clinton Neal. Both of his parents worked in the oranges groves that once dotted the landscape in Central Florida in order to provide for their family. \n \nBy watching his parents grind through each day, Neal learned the value of hard work. \n \nAt South Sumter, the work ethic ingrained in him by his parents helped Neal become an All-State performer and a member of the prestigious Parade All American team. In his final two seasons with the Raiders, Neal totaled 221 tackles and eight interceptions. \n \nHe was also a complete student athlete. In addition to his football heroics, Neal compiled a 3.8 grade point average. \n \n\u201cWe should\u2019ve just given him a key to the school,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cHe was always there. I remember driving by the school one day during spring break and he was out on the football field, by himself, doing foot work drills in the rain. So many people today talk about the problems in public schools, but I think KeKe (Neal\u2019s nickname) is proof of the good that can come out of a public school education.\u201d \n \nSherman believes that not only is Neal the best student athlete to graduate from South Sumter during his 32 years at the school, but he is likely the greatest student athlete ever to graduate from South Sumter. And if that is true, Neal feels that Sherman deserves much of the credit for his success. \n \nIn fact, he is so grateful for the impact Sherman had on his formative years that he recently presented the coach and his wife with tickets to the Super Bowl. \n \n\u201cYou can\u2019t put a value on everything coach Sherman has done for me,\u201d Neal said. \u201cHe\u2019s a big reason I\u2019m the man and the football player I\u2019ve become. He was always there for me, and he\u2019s been there for every player he\u2019s ever coached. Without his coaching, his friendship, and his guidance, I don\u2019t know if I would\u2019ve ever made it to the National Football League.\u201d \n \nAtlanta coach Dan Quinn might also owe Sherman a debt of gratitude. After all, he was the one who wanted to take Neal with the Falcons\u2019 first-round draft pick, a decision that left some pundits and fans scratching their heads. \n \nHowever, Quinn\u2019s faith in Neal proved prophetic as the season wore on. Neal\u2019s role in defensive game plans increased and he grew into an impact player. \n \nNeal added an element of toughness to a defense that many felt was \u201csoft\u201d when the season began. \n \n\u201cKeanu\u2019s become our best run stopper,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cWe play him down in the box a lot and we do that intentionally. He\u2019s very active and we want him where we expect the action to be. He\u2019s been somebody who brings the right intent to the field. He doesn\u2019t try to hit the target \u2014 the running back or receiver. \n \n\u201cHe tries to hit through the target.\u201d \n \nNo matter what happens in Super Bowl LI \u2014 whether Falcons win or lose and regardless of what kind of impact he has on the game \u2014 Neal insists he will be the same when he returns to Sumter County after the game as was before. \n \nHe\u2019ll still be a small-town kid who relishes spending time with family and friends. Neal doesn\u2019t feel as if he is different from any other native of Webster; he\u2019s just fortunate enough to get to make a living doing what he loves. \n \nIn fact, he\u2019s not even the first resident to play college or professional football. His brother was the first to play professionally and others who went on to play college football include Earl Everett and A.J. Bryant. \n \n\u201cWe always joke about something being in the well water in Webster,\u201d Neal said. \u201cIt tastes like any other water, but I don\u2019t know. Maybe somebody should bottle it and start selling it.\u201d \n \nThat\u2019s a debate for a different time. Neal is busy right now, getting ready for a game. \n \nA big game. \n \nOne that could put himself \u2026 and Webster \u2026 on a much-larger map. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to treat this as just another game and preparing for it like we would any other opponent,\u201d Neal said. \u201cBut, we know it\u2019s not just another game. It\u2019s the Super Bowl. \n \n\u201cThe most important game I\u2019ve ever played in.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Frank Jolley @DC_Sports"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NFL - Atlanta Falcons news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Webster's Keanu Neal worked hard to get to Super Bowl","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lake","zipCode":"34749","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Leesburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Leesburg Daily Commercial","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663137","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Leesburg Daily Commercial","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailycommercial.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200530248","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They get separated based on how quickly they respond to electric fields. \n \nWhile capillary electrophoresis has been around since the early 1980s, this is the first time it has been tailored specifically to detect extraterrestrial life on an ocean world, said Jessica Creamer, a postdoctoral scholar at JPL. \n \n\u201cOur method improves on previous attempts by increasing the number of amino acids that can be detected in a single run,\u201d Creamer said. \n \n\u201cAdditionally, it allows us to detect these amino acids at very low concentrations, even in highly salty samples, with a very simple \u2018mix and analyse\u2019 process,\u201d she said. \n \nThe researchers used the technique to analyse amino acids present in the salt-rich waters of Mono Lake in California. \n \nThe lake\u2019s exceptionally high alkaline content makes it a challenging habitat for life, and an excellent stand-in for salty waters believed to be on Mars, or the ocean worlds of Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus and Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa. \n \nThe researchers were able to simultaneously analyse 17 different amino acids, which they are calling \u201cthe Signature 17 standard.\u201d These amino acids were chosen for study because they are the most commonly found on Earth or elsewhere. \n \n\u201cUsing our method, we are able to tell the difference between amino acids that come from non-living sources like meteorites versus amino acids that come from living organisms,\u201d said the project\u2019s principal investigator, Peter Willis of JPL. \n \nThe study was published in the journal Analytical Chemistry. \n \nThis is published unedited from the PTI feed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[],"title":"New test to detect signs of life on alien planets","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"India.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597540856","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"India.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.india.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200530707","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:58:07Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://s3.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/indiacom-image-banner_03.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Best friends with local stars Torin Yater-Wallace and Alex Ferreira, he\u2019s spent a lot of time in the area. \n \nLike his friends, Blunck is an X Games Aspen veteran competing in the ski superpipe. Unlike his friends, he\u2019s never found success in competition. In fact, he had never executed a complete run before Friday\u2019s finals at Buttermilk. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of this as a little kid and I cannot be more stoked,\u201d the 20-year-old Blunck said. \u201cTo win here is unbelievable. I\u2019m so stoked right now. I cannot actually believe it. It\u2019s always been a dream to me, but to actually do it is unbelievable.\u201d \n \nIn a fast pipe that caused everyone trouble, Blunck put together a spectacular second run of 84.66 to win X Games gold, an absolute Cinderella in a competition that included three-time gold medalists Kevin Rolland and David Wise. \n \nBlunck\u2019s previous best finish in Aspen had been seventh place. \n \n\u201cIt was icy and it was really fast. With that, everybody was going so big, which makes them get a little bit closer to the deck,\u201d Blunck said. \u201cSecond run, I knew what I had to do and I jumped in, and right before I dropped in I kind of got in the zone and I was just feeling so good.\u201d \n \nBlunck wasn\u2019t a factor after the first run. A 71 from Canada\u2019s Noah Bowman was the best anyone could muster in the icy superpipe, France\u2019s Benoit Valentin\u2019s 58 being second best and Yater-Wallace\u2019s 36.66 a surprising third. \n \nBut, midway through the second and final round, New Zealand\u2019s Miguel Porteous laid down what was then the best run of the night, his 81 vaulting him into first place. Only a run later, Blunck surpassed him with his 84.66. \n \n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m still shaking,\u201d the 17-year-old Porteous said. \u201cI\u2019m unbelievably humbled to come back and to come away with the second, I can\u2019t even fathom it. I\u2019m so stoked.\u201d \n \nIt was Porteous\u2019 first career X Games podium. Bowman took bronze. \n \nYater-Wallace, who had two promising runs that each ended with late crashes, finished sixth. Ferreira was a late scratch from the competition. \n \n\u201cComing into the last few X Games I felt a lot of stress,\u201d Blunck said. \u201cI\u2019m also just skiing and realizing it\u2019s all just for fun. It\u2019s not just about the competition or the money anymore. I ski because I love it, and that\u2019s what has really changed for me.\u201d \n \nRolland, last year\u2019s gold medalist, took eighth. \n \nacolbert@aspentimes.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Austin Colbert"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: winter sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: extreme sports news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"VSSA grad Aaron Blunck wins X Games ski superpipe","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Eagle","zipCode":"81657","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Vail","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Vail Daily","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169711930","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"115"},"name":"Vail Daily","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.vaildaily.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200533022","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:51:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.vaildaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mensskipipe-atd-012817-620x413.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Brent Bozell III and Tim Graham, : In a conversation about homosexuality a few years ago, a Catholic priest made a powerful observation. \u201cDo you realize Heaven is full of gay saints?\u201d he said. His point: The homosexual condition exists; the exercise is sinful. Those honoring God\u2019s law carry an especially heavy cross through life, and for that they are rewarded with paradise.\n\nThe atheist cannot separate the sinner from the sin because he doesn\u2019t acknowledge the existence of sin. What to do about those who condemn the sin but also demand that the sinner be loved? The atheist hates Christianity, and Christianity-haters have no problem purposely distorting the Church\u2019s teachings while slandering its leaders if it will advance their agenda.\n\nEnter HBO and \u201cThe Young Pope.\u201d In the fourth episode of a ten-episode series, the implausible American pontiff Lenny Belardo, or Pope Pius XIII, proposes to Cardinal Angelo Voiello, a \u201creformist\u201d prelate who wants to manipulate the eponymous young pope, that all the gay priests be drummed out of the priesthood.\n\nBut the conversation continues to smear the Catholic hierarchy. The cardinal protests, \u201cThen what becomes of mother church\u2019s capacity for forgiveness?\u201d Pope Pius shoots back: \u201cWith our abuse of forgiveness, we\u2019ve become a laughingstock, Your Eminence. As unreliable as some miserable little third-world country.\u201d That insult clearly wasn\u2019t good enough for the scriptwriter, since the cardinal replies in kind, saying, \u201cWith your methods, on the other hand, we are likely to become as reliable as, say, North Korea.\u201d\n\nSo, take your pick. In HBO\u2019s opinion, the world\u2019s largest church is either a \u201cmiserable little third-world country\u201d or North Korea, which is pretty much the same thing, the latter with a heavy layer of Marxist totalitarianism.\n\nThis malignant \u201cHoly Father\u201d doesn\u2019t recognize any rules. There\u2019s really nothing Catholic about him. In the first episode, when he goes ostensibly to confess his sins to a priest, he demands that the priest tell him the sins of other confessors, which is a confidence, or seal, priests are not supposed to violate. Then, still during confession, he asserts to God: \u201cI do not believe in you. I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re capable of saving me from myself.\u201d When the priest expresses grave concern over this tidbit, he clarifies, \u201cI\u2019m saying I don\u2019t believe in God.\u201d Then he insists, \u201cI was joking.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Television industry news","group":"Media"},{"name":"Pay television industry news","group":"Media"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"HBO\u2019s Supervillainous \u2018Young Pope\u2019","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Before It's News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"557901141","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"326"},"name":"Before It's News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Financials","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://beforeitsnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200539876","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.cnsnews.com/s3/files/styles/ap_image/s3/young-pope_0.jpg?itok=ZZfF2Vx_"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 34 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"40202","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Louisville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Louisville Channel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"540"},"name":"Louisville Channel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wlky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200549605","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But mixed more good than bad. If I\u2019d only visited for hiking, the memories would all be good. But I made the mistake of camping at its primitive campsite \u2026 with five rambunctious middle-schoolers. \n \nThe three-day/two-night Camp Adventure program is for teens having experienced a loss and participating in a hospice bereavement counseling program. The idea is remove teens from daily peer pressure so they can lower their guard and bond with the group. Mike Barnett was the children\u2019s bereavement counselor who weaved grief and loss themes into basic survival activities. \n \nThe tough part was the sleeping arrangements. Mike\u2019s son was one of the three boys, and naturally he tented with his dad. I had two teens who didn\u2019t want to sleep at all. \n \nStill, it was an interesting way to view the trail, but my last primitive camping trip there \u2014 or anywhere else. \n \nI\u2019ve probably hiked Flat Island more than any other Lake County trail. And I\u2019ve written about it more too, between talking about volunteers or my fateful camping trip. \n \nFlat Island Preserve is a 2,300-plus acre conservation area located in southwest Leesburg, just north of Lake Denham. The Lake County Water Authority (LCWA) has preserved two beautiful wooded islands, Flat Island and Magnolia Island, and the vital wetlands that surround them. \n \nIt is a great place to hike for several reasons. The looping trail(s) tops the list. I prefer parking at a spot, hiking and winding up back where I started. Its main trail is the 4-mile Daubenmire Trail. It has an access trail, a 3-mile loop, and two cross trails, and is located on Flat Island. The trail honors botanists Rexford and Jean Daubenmire, who performed the initial botanical surveys and developed plant lists for Flat Island Preserve. \n \nThe main loop trail leads through several different plant communities, each with its own set of animal inhabitants. The island is generally flat but has slight changes in elevation and subtle differences in soil type and water table. The result is distinct biological zones visible to the careful observer. \n \nHeavily forested wetlands dominated by cypress trees occur outside of the main loop trail, toward the marsh. A must for me every time I hike is the 440-foot long boardwalk that extends southward from the southern loop of the main trail. The last time I hiked another visitor said he couldn\u2019t find the boardwalk. My guess is he just didn\u2019t walk far enough along the marked trail. The boardwalk crosses the forested wetland and reaches a dock on the canal leading to Lake Denham. I have yet to travel the canal in a boat or the canoes available through the LCWA. Maybe one day. \n \nThere are several cross trails to extend or shorten hikes. Make sure you take one of the brochures when you sign the visitor log. Also bring water and water equipment you deem necessary. \n \nThe Corley Island Trail is a 1.19-mile trail that runs between the main parking area and the Corley Island Mobile Home Park. The mobile home park was home to my mother-in-law for years and I have many fond memories of traveling its trails even before Flat Island became a nature preserve. My nephew Roy and I got in some hot water one Easter Sunday when we went down to the clubhouse to shoot pool. I laughed about an hour into our games when I realized we hadn\u2019t told anyone where we were. They didn\u2019t think it was funny because they envisioned us lost in the swamp. And called the cops. \n \nAs far as the trail, it winds through upland hardwood hammocks dominated by oak, hickory and bays, with an island of hardwoods in the center of the marsh. \n \nFlat Island and Magnolia Island are good examples of natural Florida and are located close to Leesburg. Visitors can become quickly immersed into the natural world, escaping the distractions of civilization. \n \nFor those with a historical bend, humans have left evidence of life on Flat Island for thousands of years. The island was homesteaded and farmed, and its timber was harvested and taken out by small gauge steam trains called trams. The residents hunted the abundant wildlife as a source of food. But most signs of human activity are no longer visible. \n \nDirections \n \nFrom Leesburg: Take U.S. Highway 27 south from Main Street or Dixie Avenue. Just south of the Southside Shopping Center off to the right (west) will be CR 25A. Head south on 25A for approximately 1¼ miles until you come to Owens Road. Turn right (west) and follow the clay/sand road to the end. Turn right into the pasture for parking. The trail starts near the sign-in kiosk. \n \nFrom the South: From the Leesburg exit of the Turnpike take U.S. Highway 27 north about eight miles and look on your left for CR 25A, which veers off just south of a defunct building which housed a recreational vehicle sales operation. Head north on 25A until you come to a cemetery. The road on the north side of the cemetery is Owens Road. Turn left (west) and take Owens to the end. Turn right into the pasture for parking. The trail starts near the sign-in kiosk. \n \nFor more information visit the LWCA at 27351 State Road 19, Tavares, which is Hickory Point Park. Phone: 352-324-6141 or email: info@lcwa.org.

Pilant, who finished with a game-high 20 rebounds, had already completed her double-double at the break. \n \nBut while Donahue was only 2 of 16 from the field in the second, they were still within striking distance, down 28-20 at the half. \n \nA total of seven turnovers prevented Magnolia from getting any more separation in the third as the Eagles led 43-32 heading into the final eight minutes. The Bishops got their second buzzer-beating 3-pointer when freshman Abigail Martin beat the horn. \n \nThe fourth quarter was a different story as Taylor Ludewig and Jordan Delaney each tallied six points to put them into double-figures and Magnolia used a 15-0 burst to pull away. \n \n\u201cThat first half we missed a lot of early shots, but Bishop Donahue had a lot to do with that,\u201d Tisher said. \u201cThey have a nice team, but they are also going through an awful lot right now with their school situation. \n \n\u201cI felt like we really regained our focus in the second half and that was the big difference for us.\u201d \n \nWhile Pilant finished with 15 and 20 on the day, Chapman equaled her with a game-high 15 points while grabbing 13 rebounds. Delaney, who missed the final 6:16 of the first period with two fouls, finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds while Ludewig added 11 points. Logan Spencer, who has added a spark to the lineup with Cecil out, scored eight points and had four rebounds. \n \nJewell Purpura had a team-high 10 points for the Bishops while Campbell finished with eight and Martin seven. Bishop Donahue was a mere 12 of 61 from the floor for just 20 percent in the game. \n \n\u201cWe had to miss 15 lay-ups in the first quarter,\u201d Shawn Martin said. \u201cIf we make our lay-ups we would have been ahead in this game. We also forced some turnovers, but we just couldn\u2019t finish. We talk about finishing all the time, and we are going to talk about it again before our next game. \n \n\u201cAs far as rebounding goes, we are not a very tall team, but we seem to get our hands on most of them, but we are not strong enough to pull them in and lose control of the ball. \n \n\u201cBut our girls played hard, Magnolia just did a better job of hitting their shots in the second half.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Magnolia Downs Bishop","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Ohio","zipCode":"26003","state":"West Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Wheeling","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Intelligencer Wheeling News-Register","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"246835686","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"37"},"name":"Intelligencer Wheeling News-Register","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://theintelligencer.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200556932","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 32 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Chatham","zipCode":"31405","state":"Georgia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Savannah","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WJCL.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"607684195","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"WJCL.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wjcl.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200559564","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 35 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"MyNBC5.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"610316583","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"MyNBC5.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mynbc5.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200567160","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Here is a peek into this hidden location.\n\nAntony Woodland Garden near Torpoint reopens to the public on March 1. A haven of peace and tranquility, it is one of the least-known gems among the many public and private gardens the county has to offer. This year the Carew Pole Garden Trust, which runs the gardens, is hoping more people than ever before will visit the unique location, an International Camellia Gardens of Excellence.\n\nWatch and discover stunning Antony Woodland Garden:\n\nSir Richard Carew Pole, former president of the Royal Horticultural Society, said: \"This is not the lost garden of Cornwall, but the undiscovered one. Sitting on the banks of the Lynher the garden has something for both serious gardeners and those after a relaxing walk in beautiful surroundings.\" The gardens run along the Lynher Estuary, an area of outstanding natural beauty, and are also renowned for their stunning magnolias, rhododendrons, wildflowers and sculptures - loved by professional and amateur gardeners alike. \n\nThe variety of flora and fauna has been planted by successive generations of the Carew Pole family, who have lived at grade one-listed Antony House since the early 18th century. The 100-acre garden is home to more than 600 varieties of camellias, including the National Collection of Camellia japonica, and nearly 250 types of magnolias. All of these come alive when they bloom in the spring, with walks covered in wild flowers including celandines, primroses, bluebells and campion. \n\nThe gardens are divided into two areas \u2013 the Woodland Garden and the Woodland Walk, situated where the River Lynher flows into the Tamar, with views across to Brunel's Royal Albert Rail Bridge. They boast beautiful walks, stunning scenery and the chance to see wild birds, including oystercatchers, grey herons, egrets, cormorants and shelducks along the estuary. Antony Woodland Garden will be open from 11am until 5pm every day except Mondays and Fridays, although they will be open over bank holidays and Good Friday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"C_Becquart published Watch this sneak peek at hidden gem: the majestic Antony Woodland...","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Cornwall","zipCode":"TR1","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Carrick","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Cornish Guardian","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"369185999","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"148"},"name":"Cornish Guardian","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://cornishguardian.co.uk","publisher":"Local World"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cornwalllive.com/9-pictures-that-prove-polhawn-fort-near-torpoint-should-be-named-top-coastal-wedding-venue-in-the-uk/story-30083151-detail/story.html#GA910g8glhj9WW8o.99","http://www.cornwalllive.com/rick-stein-to-host-his-sixth-beer-mussels-festival-in-cornwall/story-30081967-detail/whatson/story.html#e7z5zzrL80OzFuEr.99","http://www.cornwalllive.com/st-ives-b-b-west-by-five-named-the-ninth-best-in-the-world-in-tripadvisor-travellers-choice-awards/story-30079379-detail/story.html","http://www.cornwalllive.com/1-in-5-of-us-has-one-major-exhibition-of-british-tattoo-art-at-national-maritime-museum-cornwall/story-30085215-detail/story.html#zHKvxKdwIthD7UKx.99","http://www.cornwalllive.com/","https://www.facebook.com/cornwalllivenews/"],"sequenceId":"695200573277","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.cornwalllive.com/images/localworld/ugc-images/276391/Article/images/30086504/15820075.jpg"},{"url":"http://www.cornwalllive.com/images/localworld/ugc-images/276391/Article/images/30086504/15820075-thumb.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Sixteen groups and projects in England have shared the funds. The Isles of Scilly have also received funding form the Arts Council England to promote cultural tourism.\n\nCornwall 365 bosses said the funding will be used to support young people to be cultural ambassadors, help build a distinctive events programme, and create a new travel app for Cornwall.\n\nFiona Wotton, director of Cornwall 365, said: \"Tourism and the creative industries are very significant sectors in the Cornish economy and by working in partnership we are connecting new audiences with our year-round cultural experiences, creating economic value and celebrating our distinctive and fascinating region.\" Cornwall 365 is a network of leading cultural and tourism organisations and since its launch in 2014, has been helping locals and visitors to experience a deeper sense of the region, enhancing their bond with the place and putting culture at the heart of Cornwall's visitor economies.\n\nThis has increased audiences and footfall, added economic value and ensured visitors return to the area. \n\nCornwall 365 has also run a series of sessions encouraging people in the tourism sector to become 'cultural ambassadors'.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 33 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sebastian","zipCode":"72904","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fort Smith","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"4029 TV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659416","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"195"},"name":"4029 TV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.4029tv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200574950","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 33 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Oklahoma","zipCode":"73131","state":"Oklahoma","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Oklahoma City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KOCO 5","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660636","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"245"},"name":"KOCO 5","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.koco.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200577181","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

With two breaks down, they couldn\u2019t manage to earn a comeback in the set as by the time they found some rhythm and managed to hold on to their next two serves, it was way too late. The unseeded American-Colombian pair took the set in just 26 minutes to take the lead. \n\nIn the second set however, it was an inspiring start from both Dodig and Sania as they earned the break early on in the second game and held on to their serves well. It was an inspiring display of class and commitment from the Indo-Croatian pair but once Sania failed to hold on to her serve in the seventh game, the second seeded pair lost the momentum and lost five consecutive games on the trot.. \n\nDodig was far from his best in the match and had a forgettable day with his serves. He served two double faults; the second one coming on the break in the ninth game to allow Cabal to serve for the championship. The Indo-Croatian pair in fact had just a 32 per cent winning rate on the second serve. They committed 16 unforced errors in comparison to just nine from the unseeded pair and had five double faults to their name. They could also manage to convert just one break point out of three in the match. \n\nAfter pairing up last season, this was the second Grand Slam final for Sania and Dodig who had lost the French Open to Martina Hingis and Leander Paes last year. While this would have been a fourth mixed doubles trophy for the Indian tennis ace, Dodig was eyeing for his maiden title. \u201cI would like to thank my partner (Sania) for the great week. We played another final and I hope to we go one more step next time,\u201d Dodig said at the post-match ceremony. \n\nThis was the fifth appearance in the Australian Open final for Sania Mirza. She had won the women\u2019s doubles last year with Martina Hingis and the mixed doubles in 2009 with Mahesh Bhupathi. She ended up being the runner-up in 2008 with Bhupathi and in 2014 with Horia Tecau. \n\nAP/NS","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Sania Mirza-Ivan Dodig face defeat in Australian Open mixed doubles final","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"GM","country":"Gambia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daily Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"606923863","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Daily Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.observerbd.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200625904","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T19:50:46Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In boardrooms they are charming and charismatic. This hides their true character which is weakness, low self- esteem and fear. Truly confident people do not need to belittle others.\"\n\n\"Very often targets are too fearful to bring grievances and when they do they are often left alone, vulnerable which can lead to isolation, anxiety and depression.\n\nMany people who have come to me for support to recover from Workplace Bullying have a history of domestic abuse, are people pleasers with low self-esteem..the pattern of abuse will continue until the target takes their power back and starts to take care of themselves first. Getting support as soon as possible is fundamental to ensure you start to recover.\"\n\n\"If you know of or are part of an organisation that believes in CSR and would like to know more about this opportunity to do good in our society then contact me directly on Tel: 07714762012 or email:info@alisonfoxcounselling.co.uk\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Human resources news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Workplace Bullying - Don't Suffer In Silence","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Dorset","zipCode":"DT1","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"West Dorset","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Wessex Fm","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662270","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Wessex Fm","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wessexfm.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200634422","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cml.sad.ukrd.com/image/554448.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

A memorial and awards service is set for Tuesday night at the Tower of Power Church in Steubenville to reflect on the life of the late 15-year-old Steubenville High School freshman and to recognize two teachers and three local activists who have an impact on youth in the community. \u2014 Dave Gossett \n\nSTEUBENVILLE \u2014 Cookie West still mourns for her son, Lee Alexander West, as only a mother who lost her 15-year-old in a fatal house fire can. \n \n\u201cI never forget Lee. Every time I am with family or attend a sporting event or see one of his friends who are now in college, I think of Lee. This is something I think about every day. But I know Lee is looking down on us and encouraging us to move forward. I will never stop loving my son and missing him very much,\u201d Cookie West said quietly. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s why we are continuing with our fifth anniversary memorial and awards service at 6:15 p.m Tuesday at the Tower of Power Church on Maryland Avenue. We will have a 15-minute pictorial of Lee and then 15 minutes of silence to reflect on our lives and Lee\u2019s life,\u201d said Cookie. \n \n\u201cFollowing the reflection, we will honor two Steubenville High School teachers who were nominated by students who wrote essays on the teachers who have the most impact on their lives. Eliza Kelley and Toni Wukelic will receive the teacher awards, while the village impact award will go to Pastor Bobbyjon Bauman, Brenda Ware and Glenda Young-Jones. \n \n\u201cThis is the second year for our village impact award, and God put this on my heart to recognize these three wonderful people. Bauman is always working with kids and doing everything he can to help them. Ware raised her own daughters but plays an important role for the young kids involved in the Steubenville Tigers organization. She is a mother to all of those kids. And, Young-Jones works at Jefferson County Children Services, helping the young people who may not have anyone else in their lives,\u201d declared Cookie. \n \n\u201cMany people knew Lee as a great athlete, but Lee was an excellent student as well. He was an honors student at Steubenville High School. There were several teachers who helped shape Lee into the young man he had become,\u201d said Cookie West. \n \n\u201cLee was in transition at Steubenville High School. He was becoming a man. Lee loved all sports, but he was also very passionate about his education. Lee\u2019s dream was to become an engineer and he was already checking out colleges and universities that offered engineering courses,\u201d recalled Cookie West. \n \n\u201cI believe Lee is looking down from Heaven. I believe Lee is always with me. I know I will see Lee again. I understand and respect God\u2019s plan. He needed Lee. God has comforted me. My tears are tears of joy because Lee is in heaven, and they are tears of sorrow because I miss him,\u201d Cookie West stated. \n \n\u201cI am inviting the community to join us at the Tower of Power Church for a positive evening,\u201d she added. \n \n\u201cI can\u2019t thank Pastor Everett Mitchell and the Tower of Power Church community enough for their prayers and support since Lee died. God and the church are everything to me because if I didn\u2019t have them I know my life would be very different. That support has helped me to be joyful and help others and to move forward. If I didn\u2019t have that support I wouldn\u2019t have made it this far. I am grateful to have people who have supported me through these challenging times,\u201d stated Cookie. \n \n\u201cLee loved people and never met a stranger, and now he continues to give to others. We are very thankful we have the opportunity to do something that impacts others. My daughters and I are impacted by not having his presence around us. My daughters grieve in their own ways because their brother and best friend is not here. Lee may be absent from our lives but he will never be forgotten,\u201d remarked Cookie. \n \n\u201cWe want to make this community a safer and viable place for young people to hope, dream and aspire to be better than they thought they might be,\u201d she said. \n \nCookie said the service is open to the public.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Annual awards in memory of Lee West, Steubenville teen who died in fire, to be presented Tuesday","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"43952","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Steubenville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659347","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hsconnect.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200636160","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Spence has remodeled the store and now offers a variety of fresh baked and prepared foods. The store now also has a gasoline station that features Sunoco fuels. \u2014Dave Gossett \n\nSTEUBENVILLE \u2013The new owner of the Convenient Food Mart at the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Lovers Lane has created an entirely new look for the business, based in part on her career working with Kaufmann\u2019s Department Stores. \n \nIt is nearing lunch time and the women behind the hot bar and deli area are busy providing customers with a sample of something new in the display case and preparing a fresh sandwich from scratch. \n \nOwner Lucy Spence is checking the pasta that is cooking in two large pots on the stove while answering customer questions and juggling phone calls in between. \n \nAfter a 38-year career in management at area Kaufmann\u2019s stores, Spence was talked into buying the Convenient store that had been closed and has turned the location into a place where customers now shop for wine, homemade foods and, of course, state lottery tickets as well as gas. \n \n\u201cMy career in retail could not have been more successful. I started as a buyer for Horne\u2019s right out of college and then moved to Kauffmann\u2019s, where I was a store manager. But when Macy\u2019s bought the May Co., which then owned Kaufmann\u2019s, I initially left that business and was then hired by a former Kaufmann boss to open a new Kohl\u2019s store in Wheeling,\u201d said Spence. \n \n\u201cMy brother-in-law, Greg DeSantis, owns the Convenient Food Mart franchise in the area and he started talking with me about buying this store from my brother, Johnny DiCarlantonio. The store had sat empty for two years, but because of the location Greg felt we could remodel the store and re-open it. So when I decided to re-open the store it was with my vision in mind,\u201d Spence related. \n \n\u201cEvery customer who walks in our doors is impressed with our new look because we have a beautiful store that has something for everyone. The hot bar offers a variety of food and sandwiches from early in the morning when we have regular customers coming in for breakfast to lunch time and dinner. We offer incredible homemade food and a variety of great, made-to-order sandwiches. And, in the deli we have everything from the traditional chip-chop ham to prosciutto to a selection of cheeses. Our sliders are a work of art. We create a sandwich you can\u2019t get anywhere else in Steubenville or Pittsburgh,\u201d Spence said. \n \n\u201cWe cut our own meat and grind it every day for meatballs and sausage. Everything is fresh. Our sauce is made by my Aunt Phil. She handles all of the sauces and our wedding soup. My cousin, Tommy, makes our sausage and handles our butcher work,\u201d Spence said. \n \n\u201cThe food is the most successful part of our operation. But we have also added a beautiful wine section and we have great baked goods for sale. And, of course, we have recently added our Sunoco gas pumps where the gas station once stood on the corner,\u201d she noted. \n \n\u201cI basically ran out of time last fall with the installation of the gas pump area. But once spring returns we will be doing more renovations on the exterior of our store as well as paving the parking lot,\u201d Spence commented. \n \n\u201cI was born in Italy but have lived in Steubenville since I was a small child. I have always loved this town. This is a community where the people are incredible and they work hard. \n \n\u201cAfter I left the Kohl\u2019s store, I wanted to do something in Steubenville for the people of Steubenville that I could be proud of for myself,\u201d explained Spence. \n \n\u201cI felt this corner of the city needed some attention. So when I had the opportunity to do this I did it for myself and my family so people could stop at the store and see something very nice. I always felt Steubenville deserved the best and that is what we are working to offer our friends and neighbors. I love what I am doing here just as much as I loved my retail career,\u201d Spence said. \n \nIt was a major life change for Spence, who had managed the Kaufmann\u2019s store at the Fort Steuben Mall before moving to the downtown Pittsburgh Kaufmann\u2019s store and then the Robinson and finally to the Kaufmann\u2019s at South Hills Village. \n \n\u201cI was driving 100 miles a day to work and back home. But it was something I really enjoyed. I learned a lot working at Kaufmann\u2019s and have brought that experience to my own store,\u201d she pointed out. \n \nToday, Spence often works seven days a week, starting at 5 a.m. and continuing until 7:30 p.m. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t have much of a social life. I work, go home, get up and do it all over again. But it has been worth it. I really enjoy this store and the people who work here and the people who stop in. I really believe if you are passionate about something you can make a difference in your life and the lives of others.

I set the example and, in turn, the employees welcome the customers into the store. I have found the people who work here make my job a lot easier, and I want to thank Brittany Wiggins, Laura Schall, Angel Rice, Jo Jo Mort, Linda Agresta, Lexi Mastroianni, Taylor Bednar, Lisa Ostrowski and Natalie Walker for everything they do to make the store so successful,\u201d Spence said with a smile. \n \n\u201cI am always looking for new ideas and ways we can do things better. I am meeting new people all the time who come in the store. I did all of this because I want people to have something special in Steubenville. I admit I can be a workaholic. I took my vision and put it in place. Now I want to add to that vision and make our store even better,\u201d stated Spence. \n \n(Gossett can be contacted at dgossett@heraldstaronline.com.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Convenient Food Mart on Sunset in Steubenville has new life from former Kaufmann\u2019s exec","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"43952","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Steubenville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659347","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hsconnect.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200636478","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Joining in honoring the school counselors were Richard Wong, president of the American School Counselor Association; and Julie Baumgart, who chairs the organization\u2019s board of directors. \u2014 Contributed \n\nKelley Richardson Mills knows the role of a school counselor often is overlooked by adults, but the Brooke County native recently received attention for her efforts in the job at Austintown Elementary School in Mahoning County, Ohio. \n \nAs both the state\u2019s Elementary School Counselor of the Year and School Counselor of the Year, she was one of 50 state school counselors of the year invited to be recognized by then first lady Michelle Obama at the White House on Jan. 6. \n \nThe 50 were chosen for the honor by the American School Counselor Association for their creative school counseling innovations, effective school counseling programs, leadership skills and contributions to student enhancement. \n \nA 2000 graduate of Brooke High School, Mills graduated with an undergraduate degree in psychology from Bethany College in 2004 and a master\u2019s degree in school counseling from the University of the Southwest in 2009. \n \nObama has recognized the state counselors of the year in each of the last two years. Her address to the counselors was her last public speech as first lady. \n \n\u201cShe said she knows as counselors, our jobs aren\u2019t always recognized,\u201d Mills said. \u201cThat was really neat, just to be recognized by someone in her power.\u201d \n \nMills noted the Obama launched the Better Make Room campaign to encourage youth to further their educations after high school, whether through a professional training program, community college or four-year college or university. \n \nThe campaign involves a variety of organizations and media outlets to share details about preparing for college entrance examinations, the procedure for applying for federal student aid, scholarship sources and other relevant information. \n \nMills said during her three-day visit to Washington she and others heard from Don Yu, the program\u2019s director, and how social media can be used to connect youth to professionals in the fields that interest them. \n \n\u201cI think it\u2019s cool they are using these things to get youth excited about thinking about the future,\u201d she said. \n \nMills and the other counselors also toured the White House. \n \n\u201cIt was beautiful,\u201d she said, adding the Blue Room was a highlight for her because of its elegance and because it was where she met Obama. \n \nMills said she was impressed by the forthrightness of the Obama. \n \n\u201cShe seems like a genuine and down to earth person,\u201d she said, adding the same can be said of Connie Britton, star of television\u2019s \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d and \u201cNashville,\u201d who was among several celebrities and political leaders on hand. \n \nOthers included U.S. Secretary of Education John King, former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, singer Usher and Bravo talk show host Andy Cohen. \n \n\u201cIt was a whirlwind weekend. They treated us like celebrities,\u201d said Mills, who said the counselors also attended a black tie gala at historic Union Station. \n \nWhile she enjoyed the experience, Mills was happy to return to her school, where she has served as counselor for eight years. \n \nThe school is attended by about 1,200 children in grades kindergarten through second grade, and she has gotten to know many of them personally. \n \n\u201cMy favorite part of the job is the positive response I receive from them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey know I\u2019m a person they can come to if they have a problem.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Brooke native, Ohio honoree meets Mrs. Obama","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"43952","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Steubenville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659347","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hsconnect.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200642112","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But since you do have so many years until you retire, you\u2019ve got the luxury of putting time on your side as you save and plan for retirement. \n \nHere are some suggestions for making the best use of that time: \n \nInvest early \u2013 and often. Even if you are at the very beginning of your career, make investing a priority. At first, you might only be able to contribute a small amount each month, but something is far better than nothing \u2013 and after a year or so, you might be surprised at how much you\u2019ve actually put away. \nTake advantage of your employer\u2019s retirement plan. If your employer offers a 401(k) or similar plan, contribute as much as you can afford. At the least, put in enough to earn your employer\u2019s match, if one is offered. Your contributions can lower your taxable income, and your earnings can grow on a tax-deferred basis. \nInvest more as your earnings increase. As your career advances, and your earnings rise, you\u2019ll want to increase your contributions to your 401(k) or similar plan. And if you ever \u201cmax out\u201d on your annual 401(k) contributions (the limits change over time), you can probably still contribute to another tax-advantaged retirement plan, such as a traditional or Roth IRA. \nThus far, we\u2019ve only discussed, in general terms, how much and how often you should invest. But it\u2019s obviously just as important to think about the type of investments you own. And at this stage of your life, you need an investment mix that provides you with ample opportunities for growth. \n \nHistorically, stocks and stock-based vehicles provide greater growth potential than other investments, such as government securities, corporate bonds and certificates of deposit (CDs). Of course, stocks will rise and fall in price, sometimes dramatically. But with decades ahead of you, you do have time to overcome short-term losses. And you may be able to reduce the effects of market volatility by spreading your dollars among many different stock-based investments, along with a reasonable percentage of bonds and other, more conservative securities. \n \nHere\u2019s something else to consider: Many millennials want more from their investments than just good performance \u2013 they also want their money to make a difference in the world. This interest in \u201cimpact\u201d investing (also known as \u201csocially responsible\u201d investing) has led some of your peers to screen out companies or industries they believe have a negative impact on society in favor of other businesses that are viewed as contributing to a more sustainable world. If this viewpoint resonates with you, then you may want to explore these types of investment opportunities with a financial professional. \n \nBut most importantly, keep on investing throughout your life. As a millennial, you\u2019ve got plenty of the one asset that can never be replaced: time. Use it wisely. \n \nPeter Monego of Medway is a financial advisor with Edward Jones in Framingham.

N1SCO has gone from strength to strength in the last couple of years. \n\nStand Up Paddle Boarding is the fastest growing water sport in the World so to showcase this in the UK is fantastic.\n\n\"Swanage has been chosen for the event venue due to its sheltered waters, golden sands and characterful town centre. \n\nThe bay is fantastic, sheltered, safe and with a beach that paddlers and their family can enjoy. \n\nIt really is a postcard spot that has everything we need to run the championships whilst families can also enjoy a weekend on the coast.\"\n\nRacing will take part over the weekend of the 10th and 11th June 2017 from outside the Mowlem Theatre right, so spectators will be able to view the racing.\n\nCompetitors will take part in three races: 100m sprints, a 500m and a 10km race.\n\nCaroline Finch, Chairman of Swanage Town Council Tourism Committee said: \"Swanage Bay is a fantastic venue for the Paddleboard European Championship.

Plans are under way to recognize the achievement following the theme \u201cAlways There,\u201d and JCBDD Superintendent Michael Mehalik said the board has been committed to ensuring that people with developmental disabilities have received quality services and care. \n \n\u201cThe primary function of the board is to ensure that residents of the county with developmental disabilities are receiving appropriate services, including early intervention services, preschool and school programs, adult services, residential services and assistance through service and support administration to assist individuals and families make needed connections to other community services,\u201d Mehalik explained. \n \nKnown as the 169 board, which is derived from the number of the legislation that established the county panels, the group is charged with overseeing operations of developmental disabilities programs in their respective counties. \n \nUnder the Ohio Revised Code, each board is comprised of seven members, five of which are appointed by county commissioners and two which are named by the county probate judge. Qualifications include being a county resident and an American citizen; an individual interested and knowledgeable in the field of developmental disabilities; someone with experience in business management, finance, law, health care, personnel administration or government service; and a person who reflects the composition of the county. \n \nEach member volunteers to serve four-year terms and can participate for a maximum of three terms, while the board meets 10 times per year. Members are Jim Padden, Lorie Sullivan, Bill Kerr, Jim Morgan, Chris Irvin, Dick Allen and Ed Florak, who recently replaced longtime member and two-time board president Charles Joyce. \n \nThe board recently reorganized and named Padden as president for 2017, and approved general plans to operate services for an estimated 350 county residents with special needs. \n \nMehalik said since its inception, the JCBDD has helped expand services to fulfill the needs of both children and adults, be it through the School of Bright Promise to adult services at the Jeffco Production and Training centers or Shaffer Plaza, or by working with local school districts and community organizations. \n \n\u201cThe members of the current BDD board are truly committed to the well-being of individuals with disabilities. A number of members have served multiple terms and do an invaluable job in giving direction to the management staff. It is a super board that works hard to benefit the people of the community,\u201d Mehalik said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"JCBDD marking 50 years","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"43952","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Steubenville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659347","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hsconnect.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200653230","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Sponsors of the event presented the university with a check. Among those participating in the ceremony were, from left, Dave Werkin, Trinity Health System chief financial officer, sponsor; Kuzma\u2019s grandson, Jordan Kuzma; Kuzma\u2019s wife, Kay; Jim Emmerling, EM-Media owner, sponsor; Pete Rogaschi, university assistant athletic director; Tricia Maple-Damewood, Jefferson County Chamber of Commerce president; and Mike Florak, university executive director of community relations and interim athletic director. \u2014 Mark Law \n \nSTEUBENVILLE \u2014 Franciscan University of Steubenville, in conjunction with the Jefferson County Chamber of Commerce, took time Saturday between the Baron\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball games against the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford to remember Hank Kuzma, Franciscan\u2019s legendary men\u2019s basketball coach. \n  \nThe second-annual Hank Kuzma Community Day brought together chamber members and the university. \n \nTricia Maple-Damewood, chamber of commerce president, said the university sports department is involved in the community and the chamber decided to encourage chamber members to attend university athletic events. She said the chamber decided to cosponsor the Hank Kuzma Community Day. \n \nHollywood City Center, Trinity Health System, EM-Media and Mosti Funeral Home as sponsors provided a financial contribution for the event. \n \nHank Kuzma died in September 2014 at the age of 86. \n \nKuzma\u2019s affiliation with the university spanned more than five decades. As an innovative young basketball coach hired by the College of Steubenville in 1954, Kuzma once led his teams to win 56 home games in a row. In 1958, the 24-1 Barons were named the No. 1 Small College Basketball Team in the U.S by the United Press International Board of Coaches. At Midland High School, he had an undefeated season at 29-0 in 1965, and his overall mark from 1960-67 was 141-15. That undefeated team included future pro basketball players Norm Van Lier and Simmie Hill. \n \nKuzma left the college before the 1959 season, but returned as basketball coach in 1978. When the university dropped intercollegiate athletics in 1981, he channeled his on-court strengths as coach into new endeavors. He served as the university\u2019s alumni director, director of corporate and foundation support and director of development. He was involved in every capital campaign and was instrumental in raising funds for the expansion of the J.C. Williams Center and most of the newer buildings on a campus that has been completely remade since 1981. \n \n\u201cIt is so nice of the Franciscan University to do this, and it is really special,\u201d said Kuzma\u2019s wife, Kay. \n \nKay traveled from Cocoa Beach, Fla., with her grandson, Jordan Kuzma, for the event. \n \n\u201cHe would have thought this is fantastic,\u201d she said, sitting in the bleachers at the basketball court named after her husband. \n \n\u201cThe university meant everything to him. He loved the priests first of all. He loved the faculty and administration and anyone who worked for the university,\u201d she said. \n \nKay remembers the day the university dropped intercollegiate athletics. \n \n\u201cI was at home and he called me and said the (university) was going to drop sports. He knew I would hear about it on the radio and wanted me to hear it from him. He then directed his energy into another area, and he did a fantastic job. He was a people person. He had that gift in that regard,\u201d she said. \n \nMike Florak, university executive director of community relations and interim athletic director, said the Hank Kuzma Community Day is a great way to commemorate Kuzma\u2019s contribution to the university and the community. \n \n\u201cWe are thankful to the sponsors and the people of the community that came out. We appreciate partnering with the chamber for this event,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cHank left an indelible mark on Franciscan University, the athletic program and the Steubenville community. Hank built a championship basketball program during his tenure, and helped to shape what Franciscan athletics has become today. He was known throughout the Ohio Valley and beyond for his honesty, integrity and willingness to help with a wide range of civic and Catholic causes,\u201d Florak said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Franciscan University of Steubenville holds annual day honoring legendary basketball coach Hank Kuzma","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jefferson","zipCode":"43952","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Steubenville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659347","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Steubenville Herald-Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hsconnect.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200653505","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

As people worldwide are living longer, today, for the first time in history, most people can expect to live into their sixties and beyond. By 2050, the world's population aged 60 years and older is expected to total 2 billion, up from 900 million in 2015. Against 125 million people aged 80 years or older at present by 2050, there will be almost this many (120 million) living in China alone, and 434 million people in this age group worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). By 2050, 80 per cent of all older people will live in low- and middle-income countries. Already, 30 per cent of Japan's population are over 60 years old -- a shift in distribution of a country's population towards older ages â\u20ac\u201c known as population ageing - which has started in high-income countries, it is now low- and middle-income countries that are experiencing the greatest change. By the middle of the century many countries for e.g. Chile, China, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Russian Federation will have a similar proportion of older people to Japan. A longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole. Additional years provide the chance to pursue new activities such as further education, a new career or pursuing a long neglected passion. Older people also contribute in many ways to their families and communities. Yet the extent of these opportunities and contributions depends heavily on one factor: health. According to WHO figures, between 2015 and 2050, the proportion of the world's population over 60 years will nearly double from 12 per cent to 22 per cent.

But it is a million dollar question whether it will fulfill the hopes of every section of the economy? There are hopes that the Finance Minister will rationalize the Income Tax slabs to give relief to middle class people who are the tax payers in general. It is also believed that keeping the elections in five states including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, Central Government will not press for the hard budget as it may be counterproductive for the ruling Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP). According to experts common people have been most affected due to the demonetisation announced by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8, 2016 and they may find special attention in this budget as compensation. Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sector accounts for more than 45 per cent of Country's manufacturing and exports. MSME production has dropped significantly too due to demonetization, as they have a heavy dependence on cash. In Pre Budget Memorandum MSME sector has asked for the low cost funding as a large number of MSMEs are facing huge capital cost and are on the verge of collapse. Rationalisation of the Income Tax slabs is too expected from the Finance Minister in the budget as Mr Jaitley has indicated more than one occasion for this. He has indicated that either a new slab will be in place or the rates will go downwards. The tax relief limit may be enhanced in the budget as various measures taken by the government in the last one year yielded in better tax collections allowing the exchequer to go for Income Tax relief. The pension income for senior citizens over 65 years may be made completely tax free. This will not only help the elderly but will also reduce operational work for income tax authorities.

A section of university teachers raised allegation against Dean (Arts & Commerce) Prof Satyadeo Poddar for approving illegal academic activities of VC in past few months and also involved in screening process of candidature of the aspirants to the post of associate professor in four departments. While demanding removal of VC immediately, the teachers also asked for suspension of Dean Prof Poddar and instituting independent inquiry into the entire volume of purchase and appointments done during the tenure of incumbent VC Prof Ghosh. Following pressure from the teachers and to save his skin, VC committed to the agitating teachers that he would remove Prof Poddar from Deanship. But Prof Poddar fought back to VC accusing him of compelling each and every one of the university administration to regularise his decisions. \"Not only in case of recruitment, The VC is the final authority of taking all the decisions including academic activities. In several instances, VC made us comply to perform in according to his choice and some cases we forced him to change the decision. In particular case of elevation of an assistant professor to associate in Rural Development Department, I was on leave and this was scrutinised by other Deans. How can I be responsible for this, VC must clarify before taking any action against me,\" Prof Poddar told openly in the meeting of the administrative committee. The university administration had stepped back from the decision after Prof Poddar raised voice. Meantime, a group of teachers stand behind Prof Poddar and ultimately revolt against VC and Register. They however, also demanded inquiry into the allegations by an independent authority to unearth the truth and added, \"Academic atmosphere has gone down drastically in the university because of maladministration and students and scholars did not get any support for attending seminar and workshop while VC and his team has been looting out the public fund.\" Earlier VC had recruited librarian, deputy librarian, finance officer and many other important posts of the university adopting unfair means and accused of a large scale corruption of procuring e-book in the university. The VC favoured a teacher in screening for elevation of associate professor who has engaged his daughter in Rural Development department under a project. The VC is also accused of dedicating a furnish building and provided funding to one NGO run by his wife, they alleged.

Mr Sidhu's entry on the campaign trail for the Conrgess has acted as a morale booster for the party, which now senses an opportunity of regaining power in the state after a 10 years of the rule of the BJP-Akali Dal government. He may have made a late entry in the Conrgess- his joining the Congress came almost two months after the entry of his wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu- but party sources say that his whirlwind campaign has provided sails to the campaign of the Congress , which has been facing a tough challenge to the party in the state. Political analysts say Sidhu's speeches, made in his characteristic style, replete with one liners, couplets and quotes, his conversing with the people of the state in their local Punjabi language and his fluency in English, Hindi as well as Punjabi, had led his rallies to evoke a rousing receptions among the crowds. While Sidhu has been busy campaigning throughout Punjab, sources said that he has been asked by the Congress to concentrate on 30-35, including seats where the Congress lost by a small margin in the 2012 assembly elections. Party leaders feel that with Mr Sidhu leading the campaign, these seats could go in favour of the Congress in these polls. Infact, Mr Sidhu's wife has been indulging in a door-to-door campaign in Amritsar (East), from where she is a sitting MLA and from where Mr Sidhu is contesting this time, to seek votes for her husband. The Congress leaders claim that the party would bag all four Assembly segments in Amritsar city, given the huge popularity enjoyed by Sidhu in the region. They also point out that BJP candidates in the region, as also in other parts of the state have been on the defensive in the issue of demonetisation. BJP's candidate from Amritsar North Anil Joshi, a minister in the Badal government, has been apologising for demonetisation. In his public meetings in his constituency, Mr Joshi has been urging voters not to punish him for what Modiji has done. However, notwithstanding the boost provided by Mr Sidhu's entry into the Congress, a number of political observers say that AAP continues to pose a tough challenge to the party in the state. Though the last few months have witnessed a slight drop in popularity of the Aam Aadmi Party, political analysts say that AAP continues to enjoy a huge popularity among the youth of the state. Infact, AAP's campaign against the drug menace in the state over the past few months has struck a chord among the youth of the state which form a sizeable per cent of its population. Infact, the AAP manifesto for the Punjab elections made several promises to alleviate the situation cause by drug addiction in the state. The manifesto outlined a series of steps to tackle the rampant drug use problem among Punjab's youth: government jobs to recovering addicts, free de-addiction centres, life imprisonment for convicted drug dealers and random blood and urine tests for candidates running for office. In its manifesto AAP also promised free laptops for students ahead of their board exams, meals costing just Rs5 at subsidized canteens, cheaper electricity and the abolition of property tax , all of which are likely to draw a sizeable section of the voters to Arvind Kejriwal's Party . Political observers say that given the huge anger and resentment among the people of Punjab for the BJP Akali Dal regime, the Akali Dal-BJP Governmet in the state is headed for a rout. In this sense, they say that the real fight for the anti-Badal votes is between AAP and the Congress. Both the Congress and AAP are hoping that the voters disgruntled with the ruling party would vote for them in the elections. Though it is a neck and neck battle between Congress and AAP, analysts say that despite the setbacks suffered by AAP in recent months, including the desertion from its ranks, it has a slight edge in the contest in Punjab between the Congress and the Arvind Kejriwal led party. Political observers say that while Congress has an edge over AAP in Majha region, in areas like Malwa, which accounts for a number of seats, AAP continues to have a strong presence.

Expressing his strong reservation over the formation of Negotiation Committee, Mr.Patnaik in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi said such a committee will only delay the formation of water Tribunal and allow the Chhatisgarh government to complete all the ongoing projects over the upper end of Mahanadi river, which the state government has been vociferously objecting as it would have serious effect on the livelihood of missions of people in the state solely depending upon the Mahanadi river, considered as a life line for Odisha. The Chief Minister urged the Prime Minister to direct the Union Water Resource Ministry to withdraw the office memorandum on the constitution of the Negotiation Committee and initiate constitution of Tribunal stating that the water dispute on Mahanadi raised by his government cannot be resolved by the negotiation. Mr.Patnaik also urged the Prime Minister to direct the Chhatisgarh government to stop all the ongoing construction work on Mahanadi forthwith and expressed his opinion stating that \" I am open to a meeting at your level as a last and final chance to settle the dispute by negotiation if the meeting of chief ministers of the riparian states is called immediately. The Chief Minister also expressed his deep concern as the central government has failed to instruct the Chhatisgarh government to stop the construction work in respect of ongoing projects started unilaterally in the Mahanadi basis as repeatedly raised by his government which has caused serious discontentment in the minds of the people of the state who are hugely dependent on the water of Mahanadi river. Mr.Patnaik also stated that the constitution of the Negotiation Committee is not in accordance with the provisions of the Inter State River Water Dispute Act 1956 which puts the responsibility on the centre to negotiate after receiving the complaint and in this regard the the principle of federal relations mandates that the constitutional functionaries namely the Prime Minister or Union Minister for Water Resources should conduct the negotiation with the Chief Ministers of riparian states rather than appointi8ng a committee headed by an officer of the sub ordinate office such as the Central Water Commission.

A lawsuit brought by states would heighten the legal stakes surrounding the president's executive order, signed late on Friday, as courtroom challenges to the ban have so far mostly been filed by individuals. \n \nOfficials in the offices of attorneys general in Pennsylvania, Washington and Hawaii said yesterday they were evaluating what specific claims could be filed, and in which court. \n \n\u201cWe do believe the executive order is unconstitutional,\u201d Hawaii attorney general Douglas Chin told Reuters yesterday. He declined to give further detail. \n \nThe states could decide not to file, and it is unclear how many states would ultimately sign on for such an effort. \n \n\u201cThere certainly are conversations underway,\u201d said Joe Grace, a spokesman for Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro. \n \nA Trump representative could not be reached immediately for comment. \n \nTrump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the US Congress deemed to be high risk. He told reporters in the Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \u201cnot a Muslim ban\u201d and said the measures were long overdue. \n \nHowever, his order hit a roadblock late yesterday when a federal judge in New York said stranded travelers could stay in the country. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the emergency court order, said it would help 100 to 200 people with valid visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at US airports after Trump signed the order. \n \nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it would comply with judicial orders but that Trump's immigration restrictions remained in effect. \u2015 Reuters","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US immigration news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"US states discussing lawsuit over Trump immigration order","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"MY","country":"Malaysia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Malay Mail","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664182","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Malay Mail","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mmail.com.my"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200664446","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:43:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.themalaymailonline.com/uploads/articles/2017/2017-01/TRUMP-IMMIGRATION-ban2901e.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

  \n2017 estimates for Siemens are high: the company is expected to grow 6.4% this year. \n \nThe company is known for missing EPS estimates and faces this challenge while performing a merger and an acquisition in 2017. \n \nWe believe Siemens might be up for the task if the company can profit from M&A quickly enough. \n \nSiemens might be a good buy opportunity if it can meet EPS estimates. \n    \nAnalysts are very positive for Siemens' earnings in 2017. The current consensus is at \u20ac1.66 EPS for Q1 and \u20ac7.17 for fiscal year 2017. We believe that these expectations are high, but can be obtainable if the company can profit quickly from its current restructurings. \n \nThe company \n \nSiemens AG ( OTCPK:SIEGY ) is a German conglomerate and multinational that is mostly active in industrial electronics. The company has a wide range of products in various industries such as Infrastructure, Healthcare, Industry and Energy. 70% of Siemens' revenue sprouts from 3 of its business units: Digital Factory, Power and Gas and Healthineers. Siemens is active worldwide, but obtains more than half of its revenue from Europe, Africa and the Middle East. \n \nThe stock \n \nSiemens makes up about 8% of the German DAX index, making it one of the largest German blue chips. The conglomerate also trades on the German XETRA stock market under the ticker SIE, and has a market cap of \u20ac101.62B and an average daily volume of 455,661 shares. \n \n\n \nSource: Google finance \n \nOver the last 12 months, Siemens (in blue) has outperformed both the DAX index (in yellow) and the Nasdaq Composite (in red). While both indexes were up 19.5% and 26.5% respectively, Siemens was up 34.89%. This was mainly due to steady revenue reporting in the last three quarters of 2016. Siemens' quarterly results have always been a driving factor for its equity performance, as the stock usually rallies when earnings are estimated to be growing. Siemens stock in the last four days was up 3.2% in expectation of its Q1 earnings report. \n \nHigh expectations \n \nCurrent consensus is \u20ac1.66 EPS for Q1 and \u20ac7.17 EPS for fiscal year 2017. This is 6.4% more than Q1 2016 and up 2.47% in comparison to last quarter. We believe this sets the bar high for Siemens. An EPS of \u20ac7.17 would mean a growth in earnings of 6.4% up to \u20ac5.94B, even though profit was down by about 24% in 2016 as compared to 2015. This decline in profit was mainly caused by a lower income from discontinued operations, yet 6% growth is a lot of territory to regain from a negative growth of 24%. \n \nThis growth estimate of 6.4% will be even harder to reach due to Siemens restructuring plans in 2017. The company is planning to combine its wind-turbine manufacturing business with Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA. This will require some elbow grease and investments from both sides in the first few quarters of 2017. Furthermore the company also plans to acquire Mentor Graphics , a multinational specialized in electronic design automation. Siemens will be paying a total of $4.5B. These restructurings will weigh on Siemens' profit in 2017, as the advantages sprouting from these deals will only be felt in late 2017 or even early 2018. The sooner Siemens can benefit from these restructurings, the more likely it will be for the company to meet the estimates. \n \nAnother reason to believe that Siemens might not meet estimates for 2017 is the company's historic performance. In the last five years, the company failed to reach the profit levels forecast by analysts. While I do not blame Siemens for this underperformance rather than the analysts' overestimates, it is clear that the multinational has a strong track record for missing estimates. \n \n\n \nSource: Financial Times/Own calculations \n \nIf Siemens does hit estimates this year, we expect a strong surge in equity price. Rather than the usual slow decline in value after release of earnings, Siemens stock might profit from its earnings release for once. We believe that Siemens has the capacity to do so. The market environment for the company is decent and revenue has been growing and meeting estimates. If Siemens can benefit from its M&A early enough this year, chances are that it will reach the EPS estimates. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe earnings per share consensus for Siemens this year is high, but we believe that Siemens can meet them if the company can profit early enough from M&A. Siemens has to grow 6.4% in profits and that will be hard to do after declining 24%. However, if the company succeeds in doing so, the equity might increase steeply. Currently we believe the market is already set up for a slight disappointment, which makes the company all the more attractive if it actually meets estimates this year. \n  \nDisclosure:  I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. \n \nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

But they're better right now. Until we improve, they're going to keep beating us.\" \n\nRivers mostly sat and witnessed his team go down in the third quarter under an avalanche of Stephen Curry three-point slings and Warriors points that sent the Clippers to their eighth consecutive defeat to Golden State. \n\n\"If I won eight games in a row, I would have a mental edge,\" Rivers said. \n\nCurry, supposedly playing with a sore left quadriceps, detonated for 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter. He was five for eight from three-point range in the period, during which he seemed to be playing alone. \n\nFor the game he was 15 for 23 from the field, nine for 15 from three-point range. \n\nOf all the 72 points the Clippers surrendered in the first half, the most painful had to be when Curry eased up the court and casually and knowingly hoisted a three-pointer from half court that splashed through the net as the halftime buzzer sounded. \n\nThe fans went crazy. The Warriors celebrated, none more so than Draymond Green, who chest-bumped Curry so hard he fell on the court. Curry stayed on his belly for a few seconds, his arms extended. \n\nThe Clippers could only solemnly trudge to their locker room. \n\n\"We can talk about, like, being who we are. But who are we?\" Clippers guard J.J. Redick said. \"To me, we're the most inconsistent team, maybe in the league. Like, we're inconsistent. That's who we are. So, like, if we're going to be inconsistent, we can't expect to come in here and play these guys and be inconsistent and play well. It's not realistic.\" \n\nThe Clippers have lost four of five games since point guard Chris Paul had surgery for a torn thumb ligament that is expected to sideline him six to eight weeks. \n\nBut they will see the Warriors again Thursday night at Staples Center knowing it's going to take a better effort than this one. \n\nBlake Griffin, in his second game back after missing 18 games following right knee surgery, had 20 points for a Clippers team that was never in this game. \n\nThe total destruction by the Warriors notwithstanding, Rivers has been unsure what has put him in a weakened state. \n\n\"It has been three weeks now, so it's not been a fun stretch,\" he said. \"I'll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BRODERICK TURNERLos Angeles Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Curry, Warriors clobber Clippers, 144-98","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Johnston","zipCode":"27577","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Smithfield","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Raleigh News & Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658506","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2271"},"name":"Raleigh News & Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200672138","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It quickly became Sacramento\u2019s premier shopping destination, as brands and shoppers flocked from languishing competitors. \n\nToday, Arden Fair faces challenges from both traditional brick-and-mortar outlets  \u2013  mainly the Westfield Galleria in Roseville \u2013 and the rise of online shopping. \n\nAs the region\u2019s population moved to the suburbs over the past decade, a new generation of shopping complexes \u2013 like Fountains in Roseville and Palladio at Broadstone in Folsom \u2013 have gained traction. \n\nArden Fair mall\u2019s sales tax revenue has fallen from $5.1 million in 2006 to $4.5 million in 2015, according to the city of Sacramento. The Galleria\u2019s tax revenue surged from $3.6 million in 2006 to $4.5 million in 2015, according to the city of Roseville. \n\nArden Fair in recent years has experienced rising vacancy and has lost significant national brands. Cold Stone Creamery recently shuttered its food court ice cream shop. Maggiano\u2019s Little Italy last year closed its high-profile restaurant because revenue came in 40 percent below expectations. The spot remains vacant. \n\nSeveral storefronts also sit empty, including a prominent location in center court and one next to Macy\u2019s. Management has tried to stem the losses by bringing in temporary tenants \u2013 viewed as less desirable \u2013 such as a massage parlor. Jamie Donley, an Arden Fair spokeswoman, declined to comment for this article. \n\nGarrick Brown, vice president of retail research for the Americas at brokerage firm Cushman & Wakefield, has witnessed firsthand the changes at the region\u2019s six malls \u2013 the others were Downtown Plaza, Country Club Plaza, Florin Mall, Sunrise Mall and the Westfield Galleria. \n\nDowntown Plaza was demolished to make way for the Golden 1 Center. Country Club Plaza on Watt Avenue and Florin Mall in south Sacramento were transformed into strip mall centers. Sunrise Mall in Citrus Heights has struggled to reinvent itself, leaving the region with essentially two players \u2013 Arden Fair and the Westfield Galleria. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen pretty much everyone going backward with the exception of Roseville Galleria,\u201d Brown said. \n\n\u201cCompetition in the marketplace is a big factor,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThey\u2019ve declined from a solid \u2018A-\u2019 to \u2018B\u2019 as far as report cards go.\u201d \n\nBrown, who completed a walk-through of the region\u2019s malls late last year, estimated that Arden Fair had a 5.5 percent vacancy rate. That number has likely risen, with recent departures by pop-up tenants such as the Sacramento Kings team store and a Christmas-themed novelty store. In comparison, Galleria and Sunrise had a vacancy rate of 3.5 and 9.5 percent, respectively, Brown said. \n\nArden also lags in another retail health-determining metric \u2013 the amount of sales made per-square-foot of shopping space. Arden Fair rang up about $485 per square foot last year, compared with $621 at the Galleria and $375 at Sunrise, according to Cushman & Wakefield. \n\nArden commanded $600 a square foot in 2005, Brown said. Sales tax revenue has also fallen steadily, from $5.1 million in 2006 to $4.5 million in 2015, according to the city of Sacramento. Meanwhile, the Galleria\u2019s tax revenue surged from $3.6 million in 2006 to $4.5 million in 2015, according to the city of Roseville. \n\nWe\u2019ve seen pretty much everyone going backward with the exception of Roseville (Westfield) Galleria. \n\nGarrick Brown, vice president of retail research for the Americas at brokerage firm Cushman & Wakefield \n\nThe departure of merchants and especially well-known brands can brew a vicious cycle. Vacant storefronts and the lack of a strong tenant base are considered red flags among existing merchants and those seeking to open another location. For instance, Arden Fair lost fashion design house Kate Spade in 2010. But when the New York brand decided to return to the region in 2015, it made a beeline for the Galleria. \n\n\u201cNational retailers have very sophisticated real estate arms. They know what the score is when it comes to a particular property,\u201d said Edward Dittmer, a vice president at Morningstar Credit Ratings, which tracks bonds issued by malls. \n\nThe consolidation of the retail industry leaves malls with more empty space as brands go bankrupt. Malls are getting creative, such as building entertainment venues and bringing in restaurants or personal services. Downtown Plaza, for instance, experimented with tenants as varied as the U.S. Postal Service and the Golden 1 Credit Union. \n\nThe tenant mix of malls is crucial to retaining customer loyalty. Victoria Chavez, 19, of North Highlands, said she stopped visiting Sunrise mall after it lost American Eagle Outfitters. \n\n\u201cThe Galleria is far away, but the variety of stores is 100 percent better than Arden Fair,\u201d Chavez said. \n\nBrown of Cushman & Wakefield noted that the Westfield Galleria is surrounded by an area with a higher income demographic compared with Arden Fair, which is \u201cmuch more attractive to retailers.\u201d \n\n\u201cIf the income demographics in your trade area are waning, there\u2019s not much you can do,\u201d Brown said of Arden Fair. \n\nCompetition from strip malls, \u201clifestyle centers\u201d and stand-alone big-box stores is also hurting Arden Fair. Consumers gravitate toward lifestyle centers \u2013 such as the Fountains in Roseville and the Palladio at Broadstone in Folsom \u2013 due to the variety of tenants, from restaurants to grocery chains and apparel boutiques. \n\nThe Fountains generated almost $1 million in sales tax revenue in 2015, up from $93,000 in 2005, according to city data. The Fountains, which calls itself a \u201cunique collection of 40 stores and nine restaurants,\u201d has an open-air atmosphere and a weekly farmers market. \n\nThe popularity of lifestyle centers is evidenced by the Palladio more than doubling its sales in a short period. In 2012, the center generated nearly $300,000 in sales tax revenue, but by 2015 that amount was well over $600,000, according to the city of Folsom.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Richard Changrchang@sacbee.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Sacramento Kings news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sacramento news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Region\u2019s traditional malls surviving, some better than others","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sacramento","zipCode":"95816","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Sacramento","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sacramento Bee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672618","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4516"},"name":"Sacramento Bee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sacbee.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695200674665","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:01:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The \"sanitised\" report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). \n \nThe report, whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986. \n \nThe very first sentence of the report's available (undeleted) page reads: \"Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989.\" It, however, later clearly said that \"assassination is the major near-term threat\" to him. \n \nOver five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991. \n \nThe first section titled \"Key Judgments\" analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India's relations with the US, the then USSR and the region. \n \nIt also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi's life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder. \n \n\"If Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures \u2014 including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India \u2014 were taken by the Indian President ......(deleted),\" it said. \n \nInterestingly, it also names PV Narasimha Rao and VP Singh, who could be the \"interim successor\" and \"likely candidates\" in case of sudden exit by Rajiv.
