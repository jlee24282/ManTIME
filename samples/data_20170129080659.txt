Kennedy International Airport, their lawyers and two U.S. representatives accompanying them tried to cross into a secure area - and were stopped themselves. \n \n\"Step back! Step back!\" the agents shouted at them. \n \nA few minutes later, Heidi Nassauer, chief of passenger operations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the airport, was called over. \n \nRepresentatives Jerrold Nadler and Nydia Velazquez, both Democrats from New York, wanted clarification on whether an immigration ban issued on Friday by President Donald Trump prevented the Iraqis from consulting with attorneys. \n \nNassauer had no clear answer. \n \n\"We are as much in the dark as everybody else,\" said the border protection official at one of the largest U.S. airports. \n \nThe tense exchange, witnessed by Reuters, was representative of the confusion at airports across the United States and others overseas after Trump abruptly halted immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries and temporarily put a stop to the entry of refugees. \n \nThroughout much of Saturday, government officials and security workers were left to guess who from those countries could enter the United States legally and who could not. \n \nThe day ended with a federal judge issuing an emergency stay that temporarily allowed stranded travelers with valid visas to remain in the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the stay, said it would help 100 to 200 people with visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports. \n \nRECKLESS \n \nEarlier on Saturday, the Trump administration said it would have been \"reckless\" to brief government agencies and airports more broadly in advance of launching the security measures, which it says are aimed at preventing attacks from foreign groups. \n \nBut career officials in the Homeland Security and State departments told Reuters the administration failed to appreciate the complexity of enforcing the order consistently or the need to prepare agencies and airlines. \n \nAffected travelers had varying experiences at different airports, according to nearly 200 accounts gathered by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA). \n \nMany holding visas told the association they were allowed into the country without a problem despite Trump's executive order banning them. \n \nBut some lawful permanent residents \u2013 those with so-called green cards \u2013 were turned away despite guidance to airlines from the CBP that they should be allowed to travel. \n \nAt about 10 p.m. on Friday in Seattle, some eight hours after Trump signed the executive order, an Iranian with dual Canadian citizenship from Vancouver was sent back to Canada, the traveler reported to AILA. A half hour later in New York City, an Iranian arrived at JFK and entered the United States on a valid visa without any problems, according to AILA. \n \nA senior administration official said Trump's order - aimed at citizens of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - needed to be implemented urgently to protect Americans. \n \n\"There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official told reporters in a briefing. \"It would be reckless and irresponsible to ... broadcast to the entire world the exact security measures you're going to take.\" \n \nKey figures at the Department of Homeland Security were informed, the official said, declining to elaborate. \n \n\"I\u2019m not at liberty to reveal exactly who was briefed and who wasn\u2019t briefed, but everyone that needed to be briefed was briefed,\" the official said. \n \nOUT OF THE LOOP \n \nAt the State Department, one of the main agencies dealing with visas and immigration, most officials first heard of the executive order on immigration through the media, according to two department officials. \n \nWhile some offices were aware an executive order was coming, there was no official communication or consultation from the White House, they said. \n \n\"Was there any inter-agency coordination or consultation? No,\u201d said one senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \n \nImmigration enforcement is among the federal government\u2019s most complex endeavors, involving seven agencies from the U.S. Coast Guard and CBP to the State and Justice Departments. \n \nTwo senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security said on Saturday that they had not heard of any officials in the relevant agencies - or the congressional committees and subcommittees that oversee them - who had been consulted by anyone who helped draft the president's order. \n \n\"If the result is confusion and inconsistency, the responsibility all lies at one address,\" said one of the officials, referring to the White House. \n \nThe official, like others, requested anonymity to discuss Trump's order. \n \nAnother Homeland Security official told Reuters that the White House worked on the executive orders with \u201climited department participation.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt has been a challenge but folks are working through it,\" the official said. \n \nCHAOS AT AIRPORTS \n \nOne of the Iraqis detained at JFK was Hameed Khalid Darweesh, a 53-year-old Kurd who had worked as a U.S. Army translator in Iraq and had been threatened there for helping the Americans. \n \nVisas for him and his family were finally issued on Jan. 20, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of Darweesh and another Iraqi, who had also worked with U.S. military. But as soon as he landed at JFK, he was detained by CBP officers and barred from contacting his attorneys. \n \nWhen his attorneys, from the International Refugee Assistance Project, asked the CBP officers whom they could contact, the agents responded, \u201cMr. President. Call Mr. Trump,\u201d according to the lawsuit. \n \nEventually, Darweesh was allowed to leave and met the lawmakers and his lawyers, clutching his passport and weeping with joy. The other Iraqi who was detained, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, was also allowed to enter the country. \n \nBut dozens of others were less fortunate. \n \nConflicting media and government reports caused confusion for airlines struggling to deal with the order. \n \nCBP informed air carriers about the executive order in a conference call late on Friday, said a person familiar with the agency's communications. CBP then sent written guidance before noon on Saturday saying that green card holders were \"not included\" in the ban and could continue to travel to the United States. The source said airlines were allowing travelers with green cards on flights until told otherwise. \n \nThe Trump administration official later told reporters that U.S. green card holders traveling outside the United States need to check with a U.S. consulate to see whether they can return. \n \n\"It's being cleared on a case-by-case basis,\u201d the official said. \n \nThe green card issue has left immigration attorneys confused about how to advise their clients.

Smith is mistrustful of what she calls the mainstream media, particularly those elements she believes are biased towards the left. As Kirralie Smith sits at a sidewalk table in Taree for an interview this week, there is a palpable tension. She is mistrustful of what she calls the mainstream media, particularly those elements she believes are biased towards the left. But Smith has agreed to talk because she will, she says, use any platform to express her view that Islam is an ideology of violence, intolerance and sexism.\n\nSmith received relatively little attention during the last federal election as a NSW Senate candidate for the Australian Liberty Alliance, the political offshoot of the Q Society, which describes itself as \"Australia's leading Islam-critical movement\".\n\n(\"Q Society supports an integrated multi-ethnic Australia and rejects racism, which the Oxford dictionary defines as: 'Belief in the superiority of a particular race.' Since Islam is not a race or ethnicity, being critical of Islam is not racist,\" its website explains.)\n\nBut she is likely to receive far more press in the coming weeks as the co-defendant in a defamation action being brought by the businessman Mohammed El-Mouelhy, who was the subject of a critical video produced by the Q Society and presented by Smith.\n\nAlready Smith and the Q Society, also named in the suit, have rallied an impressive line-up of public supporters, including Coalition right-wingers Cory Bernardi, George Christensen and the former MP Ross Cameron, who are among a handful of public figures set to address fundraisers to be held in Sydney and Melbourne on February 9 and 10.\n\nWe sit and both reach for our phones to turn on recording apps. Smith has already explained that she wants her own record of our conversation. The tension dissipates \u2013 a little \u2013 when a sky-blue ute throbs past us and Smith laughs and points out the personalised number plate, \"TRUMP1\". Later she will tell me that she rejects the suggestion she is right wing, rather, she says she a part of the silent majority of mainstream conservatives whose voices are now being heard due to victories of Donald Trump and the Brexit campaign.\n\nSmith says she never intended to pursue politics. She has always been happiest as a wife and mother. \"I love being my husband's wife,\" she says to emphasise the point.\n\nAs it was, a confluence of events brought her to her mission. In 2000 Smith and her husband Greg, a tradesman, sought out volunteer work in Mali and there met the Assemblies of God missionary Faouzi Arzouni, whom she describes as a Muslim apostate who became a friend and mentor.\n\nTwo years later the couple went on another trip, a 10-day visit to refugee camps of the displaced of what is now known as the Maluku sectarian conflict in Indonesia, during which Christian and Muslim communities fell into violent political and ethnic conflict. Smith recalls sitting in refugee camps hearing terrible stories of violence perpetrated by Muslims.\n\nIn 2009 Smith's husband took her to a talk being given by the Q Society's Mark Durie, an Anglican vicar. During that lecture Durie said that his wife would not buy certain supermarket products because they had been certified as halal.\n\nSmith was intrigued and began her own investigations on the internet, learning that many brands are halal-certified, and that a portion of the fees paid for such certification is donated to Muslim charities. In other countries, Smith contends, those charities have directed funds towards groups with terrorist links. Her online investigation became a website, Halal Choices, a campaign and, with the support of Bernardi and Christensen, a parliamentary inquiry into \"third party\" food certification. Finally it became a political ambit, with Smith running for the ALA in a campaign launched by the anti-Islamic immigration Dutch MP Geert Wilders.\n\n\"There is no question of our country being Islamified. Now, this reply constituted a historical error as soon as it was uttered,\" Wilders once told Dutch parliament.\n\n\"I can report that they have had enough of burkas, headscarves, the ritual slaughter of animals, so\u2011called honour revenge, blaring minarets, female circumcision, hymen restoration operations, abuse of homosexuals, Turkish and Arabic on the buses and trains as well as on town hall leaflets, halal meat at grocery shops and department stores, Sharia exams, the Finance Minister's Sharia mortgages, and the enormous over-representation of Muslims in the area of crime, including Moroccan street terrorists,\" Wilders said.\n\nSmith says she does not believe there is an imminent threat of adopting Sharia law, but is concerned about what she calls \"creeping sharia\".\n\n\"We are being encouraged very strongly to tolerate sharia finance, halal certification, the hijab,\" she says.\n\n\"Sharia is definitely present in Australia \u2026 I believe there are honour killings and it is all reported under domestic violence or another name,\" she says. As evidence she says she has close friends who are pastors who work in churches who have provided sanctuary to victims.\n\nBut Smith's concerns are broader than creeping sharia. During the US election she was horrified by Hillary Clinton's support for abortion rights. She opposes political correctness, Safe Schools and big government regulations imposed upon farmers by distant bureaucrats.\n\n\"I pretty much oppose everything the Greens stand for,\" she says.\n\nShe was also appalled by the Liberal Party's abandonment of Tony Abbott for Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nThis broader political outlook, and Smith's articulate direct manner, has led some observers to speculate that she is a potential leader for a new conservative movement, one energised by the international populist surge.\n\nShe is, says John Adams, a former Coalition adviser who has written about the need for more intellectual depth in the new conservative movement, a more capable and charismatic messenger than, say, Pauline Hanson. (\"I think Pauline has a lot of good sentiment, I am not sure about the ability,\" says Smith of Hanson.)\n\nIn the months since the campaign Smith has kept in touch with supporters via videos on her Facebook page. In them she is relentlessly bright and articulate, upbeat about Christmas and Australia Day, though scandalised by the recent billboard that showed a pair of little girls celebrating in a hijab and cheerily opposed to the \"threat\" of multiculturalism. She denies ever having had media training, though confesses that she is constantly asked if she has.\n\nAsked if she plans to run for office again Smith says she cannot answer the question as her entire focus is directed towards the defamation action and her family.\n\n\"People say this is sexist, well I am sexist, I love being a wife and mother, that is the best I have ever done in my life\u2026 I love being my husband's wife.\"\n\nIn the next breath she adds that she and her husband have made the decision to use any platform to put forward their message.\n\n\"I want to be able to look my children in the eye and say I did everything I could to stand for what is right.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Nick O&#39;Malley"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Islam-critical Kirralie Smith seen as potential libertarian leader","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2750","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Penrith","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"St Marys Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"346753050","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"St Marys Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stmarysstar.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194623208","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:50:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/157221b2-f74a-469e-b91c-c9863ca767f7.jpg/r3_0_725_408_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., has asked the new U.S. Secretary of Defense to exempt civilian employees of the Crane Army Ammunition Activity from a federal hiring freeze enacted by President Donald Trump.\n\nOn Saturday, Donnelly sent a letter to newly-confirmed Secretary of Defense James Mattis inquiring whether the freeze would affect an estimated 130 Department of Defense civilians currently under contract at CAAA.\n\n\u201cAs you work with your staff to implement the president\u2019s order for a federal civilian employee hiring freeze, I am writing to bring to your attention the potential unintended consequences this order may have on the Army\u2019s organic industrial base and specifically my constituents working at Crane Army Ammunition Activity (CRAA) in Indiana,\u201d Donnelly\u2019s letter reads.\n\nOn Monday, Trump signed a presidential memorandum instituting a federal hiring freeze for a period of 90 days. Donnelly wrote that many Department of Defense civilians are term employees, meaning their contracts at Crane need to be renewed. Donnelly cited reports that an estimated 130 members of the Army Ammunition Activity workforce will have their terms expire and be up for renewal during the 90-day hiring freeze.\n\nIn the letter, Donnelly noted that \u201cat CAAA, hundreds of Hoosiers work alongside thousands of other Department of Defense civilians nationwide to provide America\u2019s fighting forces with safe, reliable and lethal munitions they need to accomplish their missions and come home safely.\u201d Donnelly further noted that roughly 25 percent of the conventional munitions in the U.S. military inventory pass through Crane.\n\n\u201cI am concerned at the uncertainty this has injected into CAAA\u2019s mission and the lives and livelihoods of the Hoosiers who work there,\u201d Donnelly wrote.\n\nThe presidential memo, Politico reported earlier this week, has many loopholes in it. All military personnel are exempted, which makes up over a third of total government employment. It also exempts jobs deemed \u201cnecessary to meet national security or public safety responsibilities,\u201d without specifying what they are, according to Politico.\n\nIt is unclear if the 130 jobs noted by Donnelley fall into one of those loopholes. Multiple attempts to contact CAAA\u2019s public affairs officer were not immediately returned Saturday afternoon.\n\nDonnelley\u2019s letter, while brief at just over a page in length, spoke directly to Mattis\u2019 directive to keep the country safe.\n\n\u201cGiven the critical role that CAAA plays in support of ongoing operations, including the fight against ISIS, I hope you will have the authority under the president\u2019s order to exempt these DoD civilian personnel from the hiring freeze based on their vital role in meeting the Departments\u2019 national security responsibilities,\u201d he wrote.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Donnelly: Exemption for Crane employees","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Monroe","zipCode":"47401","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bloomington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Herald-Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169734487","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2342"},"name":"Herald-Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldtimesonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194624050","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:26:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldtimesonline.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/c5/cc5100b0-e5ef-11e6-9765-abc2b25621ea/588d921f4d8aa.image.jpg?resize=836%2C630"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldtimesonline.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/c5/cc5100b0-e5ef-11e6-9765-abc2b25621ea/588d921f4d8aa.image.jpg?resize=300%2C226"}],"video":[]}}

There's also Art Gallerie on Main, where Lydia Richez-Bowman features her own work and that of several other local artists, as well as teaching classes. \n\nBorlaug said Capital Gallery is focused on featuring two artists on its walls \u2014 one expressive and one traditional \u2014 along with several others who work in various other media, such as glass or bronze. The gallery sets itself apart by limiting the number of artists and featuring them for longer periods. And because it does not cater to member artists, \"the world's our oyster,\" he said. \n\nBorlaug has artists lined up for the foreseeable future, with Deane Collin Fay of Gackle alongside Bismarck native Vern Erickson's western Americana pieces coming up in Februarym The Bismarck Tribune (http://bit.ly/2joTPY3 ) reports. \n\n\"There is a thriving art culture in Bismarck,\" Borlaug said. \"We're just glad to be part of it.\" \n\nHe points to Jessica Wachter as an up-and-coming Bismarck artist who has a \"real following across the country,\" with works featured in galleries in Los Angeles and Scottsdale, Ariz. \n\nStephanie Delmore of Gallery 522 agrees. \n\n\"I think we're just getting to that point of there being enough galleries\" that they could partner on events, like gallery hops, she said. \"We can start to thread ourselves together.\" \n\nAs Bismarck's population has become more diverse, Delmore said there are more people who are used to going to galleries on a regular basis. \n\n\"I think the traffic is picking up,\" she said, with the public understanding what art adds to a community. \n\nSince starting 32 years ago, Gallery 522 has wanted all local artists to be able to show their work daily rather than wait five years for their turn at a larger show. \n\n\"We've always meant to be of service to artists,\" Delmore said, and on a day-to-day basis, the gallery has a multitude of artists covering its walls. \n\nBismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative works much the same way, though with slightly different rules and organization, while BAGA has become more well-known for hosting larger shows for its member artists, Delmore said. \n\n\"I think we've got a lovely base of artists in the area,\" she said, and having more galleries showcasing those artists could result in more art-focused events come spring. \n\nBorlaug said he thinks Bismarck is where Fargo was a couple decades ago in terms of growing from a big town to a small city \u2014 and art \"makes cities.\" \n\n\"I feel Bismarck is more than ready to grow its arts community,\" he said. \n\nIn turn, that community could help grow the city, attracting more residents. Borlaug said one of the first things people want to know about before moving somewhere is the arts scene: Is there a symphony? An orchestra? Visual arts? \n\n\"It could help get people to move here,\" he said, and the art produced here is helping tell this area's story. \n\n--- \n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com \n\nAP Member Exchange shared by The Bismarck Tribune.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JESSICA HOLDMANThe Bismarck Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: celebrity gossip","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Number of art galleries increases for Bismarck","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"San Luis Obispo","zipCode":"93401","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"San Luis Obispo","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"San Luis Obispo.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659768","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"316"},"name":"San Luis Obispo.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Gossip","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sanluisobispo.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2joTPY3","http://www.bismarcktribune.com/"],"sequenceId":"695194624442","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A lawmaker\u2019s occupation is one of many factors that may influence how he or she legislates, but experts say it can have a big impact.\n\n\u201cIf you change the mix of occupations represented in the legislature, you change the mix of attitudes on laws,\u201d said Paul Helmke, a professor of practice at Indiana University\u2019s School of Public and Environmental Affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s just natural.\u201d\n\nA business owner who has had to meet a payroll will likely have a different perspective on the minimum wage issue than a laborer who has been in union contract negotiations, he said. A public school teacher probably has a different view on education policy than someone who sent their kids to a private school.\n\n\u201cThe perspective you bring when you vote, a lot of times, is based on what you\u2019re doing in life,\u201d Helmke said.\n\nThat\u2019s why people are concerned with the race, occupation, gender and ethnicity of their elected officials, said Marjorie Hershey, professor of political science at IU.\n\n\u201cOne argument traditionally has been the more a legislature looks like the kinds of people it\u2019s representing, its members really understand what the population needs and wants and will put up with,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen it comes to occupations, the Indiana General Assembly doesn\u2019t exactly mirror the state\u2019s workforce. According to occupational employment statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor for May 2015 \u2014 the most recent available online \u2014 Indiana\u2019s 92,490 retail salespersons accounted for the largest percentage of the state\u2019s 2.9 million workers. Combined food preparation and service workers made up the second-largest category, with 84,250 people.\n\nNearly 30 percent of the Indiana General Assembly\u2019s 150 members are business owners, by far the largest occupation category in a Herald-Times analysis. The Legislature\u2019s 24 lawyers or attorneys make up the second-largest category, at about 15 percent.\n\nThe Department of Labor\u2019s data set did not include a category specifically for business owners, but lawyers made up about 0.2 percent of the state\u2019s workforce.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that certain professions are more common in state legislatures than in the general population. Serving in the legislature and campaigning for an election takes time, between both regular sessions, interim committees and elections every two or four years. In general, it\u2019s easier for someone who is self-employed to adjust their schedule than someone working on an assembly line, Hershey said.\n\nLawyers and business owners may also be more aware of the effect of specific legislation. Helmke practiced law for more than 14 years before becoming mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1987. He said practicing lawyers often come across laws they feel are unjust or don\u2019t make sense, so they run for office to try and change things. It\u2019s a similar situation with business owners.\n\n\u201cIf you run a small business, like an insurance agency, a small manufacturing thing, a floral shop, whatever, you\u2019re used to dealing with governmental regulations and taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you run for the legislature.\u201d\n\nThat seems to be true throughout the country. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 15 percent of legislators in all states listed attorney as their occupation in 2007, while more than 9 percent owned a business. The only more prevalent occupation was full-time legislator, at about 16 percent. Being a legislator is a full-time position in some states, but it\u2019s still considered part time in Indiana.\n\nThat\u2019s what Hoosiers wanted, said James Madison, emeritus professor of history at IU.\n\n\u201cWe had what you used to call a citizen legislature. It was part time, not professional,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the people, of the people, by the people and for the people. That\u2019s what Hoosiers wanted. They wanted their neighbors to represent them.\u201d\n\nBut some neighbors were better suited to take on such duties while continuing to support themselves and their families. That\u2019s why lawyers, doctors, business owners and farmers were common professions in the Indiana Legislature for most of the state\u2019s history. Over the past half century, though, there have been some changes.\n\nThe Legislature now meets every year, as opposed to every other year when it was founded. There is more pressure to prepare outside of regular sessions and work on summer study commissions, Madison said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a demanding job if you want to do it well,\u201d he said.\n\nIndiana\u2019s economy also changed. There are fewer farmers, and the Legislature reflects that. According to \u201cThe Centennial History of The Indiana General Assembly,\u201d more than 800 farmers served in the state Legislature from 1816 to 1851, accounting for more than half of all the members who served during that period. That figure was down to about a quarter from 1891 to 1929, and about 8 percent for the period from 1971 to 1984. Today, only one Indiana legislator claims farming as his primary occupation, although others do own farms. State Rep. Dave Heine, R-Fort Wayne, owns and operates a family farm, according to his biography on the Indiana House of Representatives Republican Caucus website.\n\nThere are also fewer lawyers. After peaking at 32 percent of legislators who served from 1851 to 1889, the number of lawyers steadily has fallen to about 20 percent of those who served from 1971 to 1984. Helmke thinks this is because there are more lawyers. With more competition and increasing demands of state legislators, some have decided doing both is too much.\n\nThose changes are consistent with national trends. A 2015 article from the Pew Charitable Trust showed the percentage of farmers has fallen to 4.6 percent, half of what it was in 1976. The percentage of lawyers has fallen, too, from 22.3 in 1976 to 14.4 percent in 2015.\n\nOn the flip side, professions that have seen increasing representation among state lawmakers include consultants and nonprofit workers. The share of lawmakers in that occupational category increased from about 3 percent in 1986 to 8.2 percent in 2015. The percentage of legislators who say lawmaking is their main profession also has risen, from 2.7 percent in 1976 to 16.4 percent in 2015.\n\nIndiana only partially follows that trend. State Rep. Karen Engleman, a Republican from Harrison County, is the only member of the Indiana General Assembly to list \u201cstate representative\u201d as her occupation. State Rep. Carey Hamilton, a Democrat from Indianapolis, is the only member of the General Assembly who lists her main occupation as being a leader in the nonprofit sector. She is the executive director of the Indiana Recycling Coalition.\n\nConsultants, though, make up about 6 percent of Indiana legislators. State Sen. Mark Stoops, a Democrat from Bloomington, is one of those.\n\nThe graphic design and marketing consultant said the time commitment required to serve in the Statehouse, and the pay, can be a huge hurdle for some people. Indiana legislators receive a base salary of $25,435.98 plus a per diem ranging from $161 to $175, depending on the month. They can also earn additional pay for leadership positions.\n\n\u201cI think if you just have a standard 9-to-5 job, there\u2019s no way you can do it,\u201d Stoops said.\n\nAs a result, the perspectives of business owners and white-collar professionals is far more prevalent than those of hourly employees or laborers.

beverages manufacturer Delta Corporation will not be cutting jobs in Zimbabwe despite the recent announcement by its new parent, Belgium-based AB InBev, that it will be shedding 5 500 jobs globally.\n\nBarely 10 weeks after shareholder approval of what some tout as the third-largest merger in corporate history, AB InBev announced that the job cuts were supposed to save costs incurred in stitching up the deal.\n\nIn South Africa, more than 1 000 management employees are set to be retrenched.\n\nDelta Corporation company secretary Mr Alex Makamure said last week their strategies and operational programmes were driven by the board as the local unit was only an associate of AB InBev.\n\nHe, however, noted that the shareholder could contribute to the group\u2019s strategies.\n\n\"As far as we can read from the AB InBev statements, the anticipated global job losses referred to did not cover associate entities. As Delta we are not privy to the circumstances giving rise to the retrenchments in South Africa that you allude to. \"Any job losses in Zimbabwe will be driven by the unavoidable review of our business given the difficult trading environment and not as a consequence of the changes at shareholder level,\" said Mr Makamure in response to enquiries by The Sunday Mail Business.\n\nSABMiller shareholders backed the brewer\u2019s US$104,2 billion takeover by rival AB InBev late September 2016. The deal was effective October 10.\n\nSince it was a shareholder transaction, it is suggested that the SABMiller and AB InBev merger will have limited impact on the operations of both Delta and Schweppes Zimbabwe.\n\nBut The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) has given notice to terminate its bottler\u2019s agreement with Schweppes after the merger.\n\nAB InBev, which is a major bottler of PepsiCo Inc, has an indirect interest in Schweppes Zimbabwe through a 49 percent stake that is held by Delta.\n\nTCCC and AB InBev have since reached an agreement in principle for the former to acquire AB InBev\u2019s interest in bottling operations in markets such as Botswana and Zimbabwe, and for subsequent re-franchising to its preferred partners.\n\nThe Delta board has engaged both AB InBev and TCCC to resolve the issues.\n\nAlso, by virtue of being an associate, Delta is evaluating the range on international beer brands available from AB InBev, which has over 200 beer volumes such as Beck\u2019s, Hoegaarden and Leffe under its portfolio.\n\n\"AB InBev has exciting flagship beer brands such as Corona, Budweiser, Stella Artois and Beck\u2019s which we believe will appeal to the Zimbabwe consumers.\n\n\"We do not have a timeframe yet (of starting to produce them). There are very elaborate processes of establishing supply points (that is, where will the beer be brewed), registering trademarks and franchise agreements,\" added Mr Makamure.\n\nIn the short-term, Delta has discontinued international brands such as Peroni and Miller Genuine Draft, which are no longer part of the group.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Zimbabwe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Job markets news","group":"Business"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"[ 29th January 2017 ] Delta allays job fears, new beers coming Business","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"The Zimbabwe Mail","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597907619","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"658"},"name":"The Zimbabwe Mail","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://thezimbabwemail.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194631157","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T01:52:38Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Tim Brown, a Republican from Crawfordsville, would up the tax by $1 per pack.\n\nThat would result in an estimated increase of $278.3 million during the next fiscal year and $297.9 million the following fiscal year, most of which would fund reimbursements of Medicaid providers.\n\nState Rep. Cindy Kirchhofer, R-Beech Grove, wants to raise the tax by $1.50 per pack for the regular-sized pack, with higher increases as pack size gets bigger.\n\nThe higher tax would bring in an estimated new $406.8 million in the first fiscal year and $435.5 million the following fiscal year. From those increases, local governments would see an additional $11 million and $12 million in the first fiscal year and following fiscal year, respectively.\n\nKirchhofer\u2019s bill also would raise the smoking age from 18 to 21.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the proposal from state Rep. Charlie Brown, a Democrat from Gary who\u2019s adamantly against smoking.\n\nHis bill would increase the tax by $2 per pack, bringing in an estimated $530.1 million in the first fiscal year of the increased per-pack charge.\n\nThe additional revenue under that bill would fund medical residency education as well as efforts by the state to emphasize the prevention and reduction of tobacco use by minorities, pregnant women, children and youth; encourage smoking cessation; and provide research on issues related to the reduction of tobacco use.\n\nIf passed, the bill would bring $274.7 million more both for medical residency education and prevention and for tobacco reduction efforts.\n\nThe Legislative Services Agency estimates that increasing the tax rate by $2 would decrease usage, predicting the number of packs sold would drop by about 17 percent each year during the next two fiscal years.\n\nMore proposals to increase tax revenue\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Sheila Klinker of Lafayette would put a tax of 10 cents per milliliter on liquids that contain nicotine for use in electronic smoking devices.\n\nEstimates by the Legislative Services Agency show potential revenues ranging from $3.4 million to $6 million annually, with an additional $200,000 to $400,000 in potential sales tax revenue.\n\nHalf of that additional revenue would go to the general fund, and the other half would go into the Addiction Services Fund.\n\nBloomington\u2019s state Sen. Mark Stoops, a Democrat, has proposed, again, a bill that would allow the Monroe County Council to adopt an ordinance levying an additional local income tax rate between 0.1 percent and 0.25 percent to fund one or more county transit projects.\n\nIf approved this time, the bill\u2019s 0.25 percent local income tax rate would generate an estimated $7.88 million in 2018, $8.29 million in 2019, and $8.74 million in 2020, according to the Legislative Services Agency.\n\nStoops also has authored a bill that would extend that same ability to the state\u2019s other 91 counties, excluding those that can hold a referendum on funding transportation projects under the central Indiana public transportation projects statute. The estimated revenue would vary depending on the county.\n\nFor example, nearby counties, should they implement a 0.25 percent rate, could see combined revenues from 2018 and 2019 ranging from $1.73 million in Orange County to $8.06 million in Morgan County. Lawrence, Greene and Jackson counties could see two-year revenues of $4.41 million, $3 million and $4.92 million, respectively, while Brown County would be excluded from the new potential tax.\n\nA bill proposed by state Rep. Woody Burton, R-Whiteland, would give cities a similar power, but for food and beverage taxes.\n\nIt would allow city and town councils to create and implement a food and beverage tax at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 or 1 percent of the gross retail income from food and beverage sales, exempting transactions where sales tax does not apply. Cities with this tax already in place, or that receive revenue from a similar county tax, would not be eligible under the proposal.\n\nNearby cities with a 1 percent food and beverage tax brought in minimal revenue in the past fiscal year \u2014 about $367,000 in Martinsville, about $385,000 in Mooresville and a little more than $171,000 in Nashville.\n\nBigger cities saw higher revenues during the most recent fiscal year. Towns smaller than Bloomington, such as Avon, Plainfield and Noblesville, brought in more than $1 million in revenue from the food and beverage tax. Carmel, which is comparable in population to Bloomington, raked in just shy of $1.9 million.\n\nState Sen. Luke Kenley, a Republican from Noblesville who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, wants to help the state capture revenue it loses when Hoosiers buy products from retailers that don\u2019t have a physical presence in Indiana.\n\nThose retailers currently don\u2019t have to charge sales tax, which studies have shown resulted in a revenue loss of anywhere from $77 million to $195 million in 2012.\n\nKenley has authored a bill that would require remote sellers to collect and remit sales tax if their gross annual revenue from sales into Indiana is more than $100,000 or if they make sales into Indiana in more than 200 separate transactions.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Tax news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Tax increases could be on the way","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Monroe","zipCode":"47401","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bloomington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Herald-Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169734487","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2342"},"name":"Herald-Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldtimesonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194631379","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:24:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldtimesonline.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/47/94721cfe-e5ec-11e6-a6a5-738063cb02fd/588d8ce39dcb2.image.jpg?resize=300%2C214"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldtimesonline.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/47/94721cfe-e5ec-11e6-a6a5-738063cb02fd/588d8ce39dcb2.image.jpg?resize=881%2C630"}],"video":[]}}

He remembers the stigma his parents faced while he was growing up. \n\n\"Now it's cool,\" he said. \"If I was a teenager now, I'd get a lot more dates than I did in the '80s.\" \n\nDuring his 20 years as a performer, Wann's parents have remained an inspiration for his comedy show, he said. \n\n\"I feel like I want to sign in case my parents ever came to a show,\" he said. \n\nWhile his wife has served as his speaking interpreter for his comedy shows, Wann said he also often has local people \u2014 such as Happy Hands adviser Liza Bancroft \u2014 interpret sign language into speech. \n\n\"He's so well-respected and well-known in the deaf community,\" Bancroft said. \"So it's a real unique opportunity.\" \n\nOpportunity awaits the students continuing their ASL education as well, Wann said. \n\n\"You are learning our language,\" Wann signed during his show. \"You have two choices: You can use that language to help deaf people ... or you can use it to hurt them. I know you guys want to use it to help. Really, I hope some of you become interpreters, or maybe lawyers.

There are however concerns that there continues to be unrestrained revenue leakages from the system. Fiscal devices are therefore expected to plug the loopholes.\n\nA local businessman who spoke to The Sunday Mail Business on condition of anonymity said not only were some of the devices expensive, but they are out of stock as well. This, he said, was making it difficult to comply.\n\n\"I visited an approved supplier and the two devices they can supply cost US$1 300 and US$1 700.\n\n\"They have given me a quotation of US$1 700 saying this is the best but the company is saying it does not have the devices in stock, so when I pay, they will write me a tax clearance letter which I take to Zimra so that I operate.\n\n\"Basically, I am now paying US$1 700 for a piece of paper. What nonsense is that? All the Zimra approved suppliers don\u2019t have the devices and they seem to be working in cahoots with Zimra to say, \u2018no one will get a tax clearance without a fiscal machine\u2019.\n\n\"I am not refusing to comply but why should I pay for something that is not there; this is wrong,\" said the businessman.\n\nThe current grumblings within industry are similar to the same teething challenges that Zimra faced when it embarked on the project more than six years ago.\n\nCompanies believe that Zimra had to fund the cost of rolling out the project as it was the main party expected to benefit.\n\nGovernment responded by crafting a law through which companies will be refunded through rebates.\n\nIn terms of the law, clients can claim 50 percent of the cost of acquiring the devices as Input Tax on their VAT returns and the balance is claimable as Special Initial Allowance in terms of the Income Tax Act (Chapter 23:06).\n\nIn addition, no Customs Duty or VAT is payable on the import of fiscal devices, and no VAT is charged on the sale of the gadgets on the local market, as part of incentives meant to make the fiscal devices affordable for the success of the fiscalisation project.\n\nHowever, businesses are concerned by the initial outlay that ranges between US$1 000 to US$1 700 for the purchase of different types of fiscal devices.\n\nGlobal Horizons (Private) Limited, one of the approved suppliers as published in the Government Gazette of July 29, 2011, sells point of sale machines at between US$200 and US$250 while the fiscal printer is going for US$1 050.\n\nThis takes the total price to US$1 300, a huge figure that businesses claim is an added cost to doing business, especially in the current economic circumstances.\n\nBut such glitches in implementing the project are not peculiar to Zimbabwe alone.\n\nIn Tanzania, which has successfully rolled out the fiscalisation project, resulting in a 9,6 percent increase in revenues to the fiscus between 2010 and 2011, and 23 percent for 2011 to 2012, there was also\n\na furore by some businesses complaining over the cost of electronic fiscal devices.\n\nThe Tanzanian government ended up forming a special task force to work on complaints by the business community against the electronic fiscal devices.\n\nFirms that resist fiscalisation in Tanzania are fined 3 million Shillings (almost US$1 343). Zambia is also working on fiscalisation to shore up revenues.\n\nShortage of devices\n\nZimra board secretary and director for legal and corporate services Ms Florence Jambwa conceded that the devices were currently not readily available and were expected to hit the market later this month and in early February.\n\n\"The response from clients who qualify for fiscalisation has been positive and encouraging.\n\n\"Approved suppliers of fiscal devices have been approached by a number of companies and some of these VAT registered companies have either paid deposits or made full payment for their fiscal devices.\n\n\"The suppliers of fiscal gadgets are in the process of procuring the devices and delivery is expected in late January to early February 2017,\" said Ms Jambwa.\n\nThe number of firms requiring fiscal machines could not be ascertained as businesses continue to register either voluntarily or due to revenue enhancement measures such as field audits being enforced by Zimra.\n\nThe taxman is also working on increasing the number of suppliers of fiscal devices in the market.\n\nAccording to the Government Gazette of July 2011, there are 10 approved suppliers of the fiscal devices.\n\nMs Jambwa said the anticipated increase in the number of service providers would \"improve the supply of the gadgets\" and consequently cause a price reduction due to competition.\n\nZimra does not determine the prices of fiscal devices since suppliers operate as independent business enterprises.\n\nHowever, Zimra says it continuously engages suppliers on the aspect of pricing to ensure the affordability of fiscal devices. \"Plans to bring in additional suppliers into the market are expected to result in competition, which may culminate in the lowering of prices of fiscal devices and servicing costs,\" added Ms Jambwa.\n\nGraft, greed behind proclastination\n\nSources who spoke to Then Sunday Mail Business last week indicated that suspicious delays in completing the fiscalisation project, which became legally enforceable after Statutory Instrument 104 of 2010 on June 8, 2010, and the seeming protection of an enclave of tax evaders are part of the reasons that led to the suspension of some Zimra directors, particularly in the Information Communication Technology (ICT) department.\n\nIn December last year the Authority suspended director of ICT and infrastructure development Mr Tjiyapo Velempini, head of ICT Mr Allen Saruchera, Systems development manager Mr Can Goredema, including some officials in the loss control department. It is believed that some senior executives at Zimra had roped in Inspur \u2014 a Chinese information technology multinational company \u2013 under unclear circumstances to develop their own tax management system.\n\nThe move, which was resisted by the market, was interpreted by approved suppliers of fiscal devices as a parallel programme.\n\nPrices that were offered under the Inspur tax management system were also understood to be triple the market price in some instances.\n\nThere are also allegations that Inspur had set aside a resource envelope of US$30 million for the project, but the details remained unknown to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, which is the parent ministry of Zimra.\n\nSuch undertakings resultantly delayed the roll out of the system and naturally resulted in significant revenue leakages.\n\nThere are also damaging allegations that senior management at Zimra were complicitly aided and abetted some non-compliant giant retailers. In a statement accompanying the revenue performance report for the year ended December 31, 2016, Zimra\u2019s board chairperson Mrs Willia Bonyongwe last week indicated the extent to which the tax man was been prejudiced by tax evaders and non-compliant companies.\n\nLast year alone, the debt owed by companies rose from US$1,97 billion at the beginning of the year to US$2,7 billion by the end of 2016.\n\n\"The growth in debt reflects the new debt arising from an assessment done due to automation either from previous under-declarations and evasion as well as inability to pay taxpayers. Most people do not take their tax obligations seriously and fast and due to corruption have gotten away with it in the past but the system has caught up with them.\n\n\"There is also a noticeable increase in litigation from non-compliers and we hope that the Judiciary will allow these cases to be heard fast and we commend the introduction of the Fiscal Court. . .\n\n\"Zimra is pushing for stiffer penalties including jail for tax evaders as is best practice globally. . .\n\n\"We cannot afford to have enclaves who do not pay taxes,\" said Ms Bonyongwe.\n\nThe electronic cargo tracking system that has since been introduced is also expected to curb transit fraud. \u2013 Sunday Mail","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"[ 29th January 2017 ] Businesses grumble over fiscal devices Business","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"The Zimbabwe Mail","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597907619","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"658"},"name":"The Zimbabwe Mail","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://thezimbabwemail.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194645476","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T01:35:14Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Police were called to attend following reports of a man touching women on the number 12 bus in the Dulwich area. \n \nA 22-year woman was travelling home when the suspect deliberately sat next to her, despite there being many free seats on the bus. \n \nThe suspect asked her whether she was alright and engaged her in further small talk. As she got up to leave, he sexually assaulted her. \n \nThe woman then moved to a different part of the bus and witnessed the man approach another victim, a 17-year-old girl, who confronted him. The incidents were reported to the bus driver, and the man alighted in Barry Road, Dulwich. \n \nThree days later on Friday, January 27, a different 17-year-old girl boarded a 176 bus at around 15:15hrs. A short time later, the same suspect boarded the bus and sat opposite her. After trying to speak to her, he intentionally fell onto the victim and touched her inappropriately. \n \nLater on that day at around 17:00hrs, a 13-year-old girl reported that she was sexually assaulted whilst travelling on a 363 bus. A second 13-year-old also subsequently reported a man of the same description trying to engage her in conversation on the 197 bus near Dulwich Library, SE22, which made her feel uncomfortable. \n \nAt around 17:50hrs, a-15-year-old girl boarded a 171 bus at Catford Train station. The suspect, coming from another part of the bus, sat opposite from her and started to touch her knee. Feeling frightened, she got off the bus nearly Bromley Road, SE6. The man followed her and tried to engage her in conversation before groping her. The victim then ran off. \n \nPolice are treating these incidents as linked and want to public's help to trace the suspect. He is described as a black male, aged in his twenties, with short black hair and facial stubble. He was wearing a black bomber jacket with a white fur trim on the hood and blue baggy jeans. \n \nDC Alex Price from the Met's Road and Transport Policing Command said: \"We are keen to trace the suspect carrying out these despicable attacks on young girls and women in public. Five victims have been targeted by this man and we believe there could be many more victims who are yet to come forward.\" \n \nMembers of the public are advised not to approach the male if spotted but to call 999. To give information about the man pictured please call 101.

The story seems, initially, to be one of connection, of a loner, Wes, a former high school art teacher forced out of his job and trying, unsuccessfully, to build a life in the city. Despite the ghosts of the past hanging over him, his neighbour Randy seems to be a steadying influence, perhaps even a friend. They work together, building a new porch for Wes\u2019s house, and drink together once construction is done, \u201clounging like gods after a long epic act of creation.\u201d \n \nWes reflects on his neighbour: \u201cI liked Randy\u2019s thoughtful nature. I liked to imagine him shrunk down to adolescence, his brawny arms across the desks of one of my art classes, a bad kid in some people\u2019s eyes, but not in mine.\u201d As the story twists to a close, though, it becomes clear that Randy is, in fact, bad (this is a crushing understatement), a truth which Wes remains somehow unable to fully see. \n \nIt\u2019s a shocking and haunting story and in many ways \u201cMy New Best Friend in Exile\u201d is characteristic of the collection as a whole. These are stories of heartbreak and betrayal, of limited vision and wilful blindness, stories laced with booze, drugs, sex, secrets and unemployment, with casual (and caustic) misogyny, racism, classism and violence. The stories are, as a rule, devoid of outer commentary or narrative distancing, forcing the reader to confront and reconcile the often disturbing mindsets and occurrences which mark the work. \n \nIt doesn\u2019t make for easy reading, but A Plea for Constant Motion has an air of urgency to it, a sense of relevance which is at once odd for a collection of short stories and disturbing in and of itself. \n \nCarlucci, whose first collection The Secret Life of Fission was awarded the Danuta Gleed Award, writes beautifully of ugliness, immersing the reader in the minds and hearts of characters most of us would like to avoid, or, more critically, would prefer to believe didn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s a perfect collection for a world which confronts us with increasing violence and ugliness every day. \n  Delivered daily The Morning Headlines Newsletter   \nThe Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

The phenomenon of grown kids boomeranging back home has become a big issue when it comes to baby boomers planning for retirement, says Chan, senior vice-president, TD Wealth Financial Planning. \n \nAccording to a recent TD survey, the boomerang effect is in full swing, as a growing number of millennials continue to lean on their parents or grandparents for financial support \u2014 or to get their old room back. \n \nIn fact, almost 60 per cent of young adults ages 20 to 24 were living with their parents in 2011, according to the most recent census data, while one quarter of 25- to-29-year-olds were living with their parents that year. And Statistics Canada says the trend has been steadily increasing since 1981. \n \nOne in four Canadian boomers admits to supporting their adult children or grandchildren, says the TD study. \n   \nArticle Continued Below \n   \n\u201cThe people ready to retire in 10 or 15 years, they want their children to have a good start,\u201d she says, adding, \u201cIt may derail them a bit\u201d from their retirement goals. \n \nThe survey found that 62 per cent of the baby-boom generation feels that supporting their offspring into adulthood is preventing them from saving enough for retirement, and 58 per cent reported feeling financially stressed by the situation. \n \n\u201cAs a parent or grandparent, it\u2019s natural to want to help our kids and grandkids, who may be facing financial challenges such as finding full-time employment or paying their day-to-day expenses,\u201d Chan says. \n   \n\u201cIt\u2019s important that this desire to help is balanced with the goals you have when it comes to retirement,\u201d she notes. \n \nThe trend is not going unnoticed by boomers\u2019 children, either. Almost half (44 per cent) of millennials report that they\u2019re fully aware of the financial stress the situation places on mom and dad, with 43 per cent of millennials saying they are willing to cut costs before asking for their parents\u2019 help. \n \nSome tips to help parents and kids coping with the \u201cboomerang\u201d effect: \n \nBe Prepared \n \nIt is important to understand that retirement goals are still within reach. Meeting with a financial planner and doing a goals-based assessment is key to determining what the options might be for parents who are supporting your kids while keeping their retirement plans on track. \n \nNegotiate the Return \n \nDiscuss how everyone can contribute to the household budget and operations. For example, parents may be able to cover basics such as room and board, but expenses such as cell-phone bills, car payments, and recreational activities could be covered by the kids. Also, consider having everyone pitch in to the costs of running the day-to-day operations and dividing the household chores. \n \nPrepare to Relaunch \n \nWhether it\u2019s a newly married daughter and her spouse and child, or a son who recently graduated and has moved back home, there are plenty of opportunities to educate all family members on the importance of being fiscally responsible and working toward financial independence. Everyone should join in the financial conversations to discuss how to navigate their current circumstances and establish good financial habits. Use a financial planner who has experience working with multi-generational family dynamics. \n \nDecide When to Release \n \nAs everyone maps out their action plans, identify a date when you will no longer be financially committed to each other. As you approach this date, set up a series of mini-goals that will allow parents or grandparents to free up funds to divert toward retirement savings, while ensuring that the kids are meeting the savings targets they set in their own plans. \n   Delivered daily The Morning Headlines Newsletter   \nThe Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

It is an unexceptional birth, surrounded by family, and for the briefest of moments, Archie is \u201cthe youngest human being on the face of the earth.\u201d \n \nBut things do not remain unexceptional for long. \n \nHappenstance has always played a significant role in Auster\u2019s fiction. \u201cChance is part of reality,\u201d he wrote in The Art of Hunger , his 1992 collection of essays and interviews, \u201cwe are continually shaped by the forces of coincidence, the unexpected occurs with almost numbing regularity in our lives.\u201d \n   \nArticle Continued Below \n   \nWith 4321 , Auster plays out the string of chance, wondering, as young Archie himself wonders: \u201chow things could be different even though he was the same . . . The same boy with different parents. The same boy with the same parents who didn\u2019t do the same things they did now . . . anything was possible, and just because things happened in one way didn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t happen in another. Everything could be different.\u201d \n \nAnd so Auster follows four possible paths of Archie\u2019s life, each contingent upon unexpected occurrences. Chief among these unanticipated events is the demise in November 1953 of 3 Brothers Home World, Stanley Ferguson\u2019s furniture business. \n \nThe how and why of that demise \u2014 by theft, accidental fire, arson or acquisition \u2014 propels the four Archies on their singular journeys, leading one to Paris, one to Princeton, one to the tumultuous campus of Columbia University during the 1968 student occupation, and one to an early and tragic end. \n   \nAuster is nothing if not a clever writer, and 4321 is a wonderfully clever book. The Austerian hallmarks of intertextuality and metafiction are on show throughout. For those who have read his work, familiar names will pop up: Daniel Quinn from The City of Glass , Adam Walker from Invisible , Peter Aaron from Leviathan , Marco Fogg and David Zimmer from Moon Palace and The Book of Illusions . \n \nAnd there are other postmodern tricks on display, as when the third Archie sets out to write his first book, the middle section of which he concludes with a description taken almost verbatim from earlier in the novel itself. \n \nBut 4321 is much more than a piece of literary gamesmanship \u2014 though Auster\u2019s detractors have often accused him of being capable of little more. It is a heartfelt and engaging piece of storytelling that unflinchingly explores the 20th century American experience in all its honour and ignominy. \n \nThis is, without doubt, Auster\u2019s magnum opus. Weighing in at 964 pages, it dwarfs any of his other works, and gives him the room to fully indulge his fictional obsessions: the question of identity, the writing life, absent fathers, the moral obligations of both art and the artist, as well as \u2014 and perhaps most importantly, given the present circumstances \u2014 the betrayal of America by its politicians, not only Democrats and Republicans, but also those radical groups that arose out of the turbulence of the 1960s, only to fall prey to the same hypocrisies and egocentricities of their mainstream foes. \n \nAnd yet, for all its gravitas, 4321 itself springs from a joke, a \u201cjoke about the Jews from Poland and Russia who had boarded ships and come to America,\u201d the punchline of which Auster delivers with such aplomb as to reshape the reader\u2019s entire perception of the novel. It is one of those rare instances in reading, when, for the briefest moment, everything seems to stop and reorder itself, a moment of true revelation, when the world \u2014 at least the world of the novel \u2014 makes sense, and one can\u2019t help but admit they are in the presence of genius. \n \nStephen Finucan is a novelist and short story writer.

Case in point: Uber. The hashtag #DeleteUber has been spreading on social media amid protests against Trump's Muslim travel ban. The ride hailing service was accused of \"strike breaking\" in New York Saturday, while others condemned remarks made by Uber CEO Travis Kalanick indicating he would work with the president. \n\nIn a Facebook statement, Kalanick said the \"ban will impact many innocent people.\"SEE ALSO: Hundreds travelled to New York's John F.

After Uber tweeted that surge pricing had been turned off at the airport, the company was quickly accused by some of \"strike breaking.\"\n\nTwitter and Facebook users began to share screenshots of themselves deleting their Uber accounts, including the message they were sending to the company.\n\n\"Uber has actively chosen to support racism, xenophobia, and bigotry,\" @katebergie wrote.\n\n\"Uber CEOs are collaborators with Trump and therefore support fascism,\" @flwrwrk wrote.\n\nUber picked the wrong city in which to be racist scabs #deleteuber pic.twitter.com/nWKZ9NZka0\n\n\u2014 Kate Berg (@katebergie) January 29, 2017 Don't just delete your @uber app. Deactivate your account too.

It is indeed terrifying!\" Pham wrote in the leaked email.\n\nDespite Uber's official response, it does not appear the #DeleteUber campaign is slowing down. \n\nWhile the American technology industry's ethos has been mostly one of open borders and free market principles, Trump's populist agenda will test the strength of those values. \n\nThe coming months will show what any openness to Trump's agenda, the Muslim travel ban notwithstanding, means for a company's public image and bottom line.Uber has been contacted by Mashable for comment.\n\n#deleteuber I'm done with companies normalizing what's happening.

Each moment had been an agony of fear and anticipation until the last sliver of waning moon had left the sky. Then Cecelia and her silent guide slipped out the garden gate. Behind them loomed the huge stone bulk of the Cataract House hotel. Most guests slept. A few windows gleamed with the warm yellow of gaslight, but she imagined them as eyes, each one accusing her of abandonment, ingratitude, pride. \n \nShe wore a dark dress, as instructed, without collar or ornament whose flash might betray her. The dark-clad man led her to the river\u2019s edge, where its border of low shrubbery would mask their passage. The clamour of rushing water blocked out all other sound. \n \nThey kept close to the bushes as they crept along. The man took her hand. He had come this way countless times. To stumble here was death. \n \nThe air was saturated with moisture, the roar of the great cataract deafening as they passed its crest. She could feel spray on her face and hands. They came to Prospect Point quite suddenly. A few rapid steps took them across open lawn. Wooden railings enclosing the staircase were just visible where the land dropped away. \n   \nArticle Continued Below \n   \nThree hundred stairs led down to the bottom of the gorge. Following her guide\u2019s swift descent, she counted every one. The river was eerily calm here in the little inlet where boats tied up. Just a few feet away, unfathomable quantities of falling water crashed and roiled against jagged rocks. \n \nHe left her for what seemed a very long time. She trembled, weeping a little for all she was leaving behind. Returning, he drew her still further on. There were private slips beyond the ferry dock. The man again took her hand as they felt their way down the very centre of a low dock, planks rough under her slippers. She felt disembodied as she stood right above the tumbling, churning water of the channel. \n \nShe was numb with chill and fear. Strong hands lowered her carefully into the sturdy craft. He slipped the knot and stepped in. Taking the oars, he steered the long, narrow boat away from shore and out onto the broad expanse of foaming water. The boat pivoted and tossed but he rowed steadily, keeping to his course. It seemed impossible that there was even this much calm so close to the base of Niagara Falls. \n   \nFifteen minutes it took to cross, and then the work of seconds to stand and grasp the hands of the one waiting for her on that other shore. She turned back towards the river, but he was already pulling away. He did not see her raise her hand in farewell. \n \nBenjamin Pollard Holmes was returning from a trip aboard the City of Toronto with a wide-eyed fifteen-year-old girl in tow. Cecelia Jane Reynolds was slight and very attractive. She had a Kentucky accent, a proudly determined personality and a kindly but careful manner. \n \nWith colourful flags flying fore and aft and passengers crowded on deck in anticipation of their landing, the steamer bearing Cecelia to her new Toronto home steamed through the Western Gap, the entry to Toronto Bay. Above her, Captain Dick stood before the wheelhouse facing into the wind as he gave the order for a small cannon to be brought forward to signal their arrival. Cecelia was excited and she was very much looking forward to seeing her new hometown. Her only regret was the fact that her mother, Mary, and young brother Edward were not there to enjoy it with her. \n \nThe tranquil waters of the bay were partially enclosed by a long, lushly wooded sandbar that curved south and west out into the lake from the mouth of the Don River. In the harbour bobbed pleasure craft and sailing schooners, the workhorses of the coastal trade, as well as several gaily painted steamboats. The paddlewheeler was swift, its twin engines racing as it passed the lighthouse at Gibraltar Point on the tip of the peninsula, and sailed into port beneath the cannon of Fort York on the opposite shore. Toronto lay on a wide, low plain between two great rivers, the Humber and the Don.. From conversations with Benjamin and her Niagara hosts, Cecelia knew that Toronto had been founded in 1793 by the same Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe who had forced through the legislation guaranteeing her freedom. \n \nCecelia had learned that more than eight hundred African Canadians now lived in Toronto proper, with another hundred or so on small acreages outside the city limits. There were many more in the southwest section of the province near the Detroit River, which, like Niagara, was an important transit point into Canada for people in search of freedom. Toronto now had three Black churches, that provided both sanctuary and society for newcomers. Hopeful refugees arrived almost daily in groups of two or three, carrying with them little except courage and industry, but eager to embark on life in a part of North America where discrimination against people with darker skin, if not absent, at least wasn\u2019t codified in law. \n \nThe City of Toronto slowed as it approached the docks. Cecelia would find much about the city that seemed familiar. Like her hometown of Louisville, Toronto was a departure point for opening up the continent\u2019s vast Western reaches. Louisville and Toronto, with about twenty thousand inhabitants each, were also about the same size, although the latter\u2019s Black population was tiny by comparison, and both served large agricultural hinterlands. It was just now in the process of industrializing; smokestacks pierced the sky, a grey haze hovering in the air above the city streets. \n \nAs the steamer neared the shore, Cecelia spied only one or two Black faces among the dockworkers and carters awaiting its landing at the wharf. Here in Toronto she knew there were white labourers as well as Black ones, who worked at whatever job came to hand. Employment was at a premium in the growing city, so there was work and opportunity for all. As the City of Toronto pulled up to the Church Street wharf, Cecelia finally realized that once she put her foot down on dry land, she would be safe. Here no one could take away her new-found freedom. Delighted and a little apprehensive, she disembarked. \n \nExcerpt from Steal Away Home by Karolyn Smardz Frost ©2017.

In addition to the tourists, a skipper and two crew members were also on board when the boat sailed out on Saturday morning, the spokesman said, adding that weather conditions were bad on the day.\n\nThey were on their way to Pulau Mengalum, an island known for its pristine beaches and dive sites, west of Kota Kinabalu, the capital of Sabah state.\n\nA statement by China\u2019s foreign

400 nautical square miles is being searched with officers from the agency, the police, the navy and the airforce involved.\n\nMalaysia navy chief Ahmad Kamarulzaman Ahmad Badaruddin tweeted that it was \"so sad as it happened on CNY (Chinese New Year)\" and said navy ships and a C130 aircraft were onsite for the search and rescue operation.\n\n\"I, like all the relatives of those on board, am

champions to play one-off match in Australia A-League fans are to get another chance to witness a Premier League heavyweight up close and personal with Perth Glory announcing a friendly fixture against Chelsea in mid-2018.\n\nThe five-times English champions \u2013 four in the Premier League era \u2013 will travel to Western Australia to play at the new Perth stadium, which is scheduled to be completed by the start of the 2018 AFL season in March next year. \n\nBranislav Ivanovic proves the unlikely star as Chelsea rout Brentford Read more A sell-out crowd is expected at the 65,000-capacity venue for the visit of Antonio Conte\u2019s star-studded squad.\n\nThe match, which will be current league leaders Chelsea\u2019s only appearance on their Australian trip, will form part of both clubs\u2019 preparations for their respective 2018-19 campaigns.\n\nThe announcement comes just two years after the last time the London club toured Australia, in 2015 when they played and beat Sydney FC.\n\n\"This is a very exciting opportunity for Chelsea to play in front of some of our most passionate supporters,\" said Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck.\n\n\"We were delighted with the reception we received in Sydney when we visited in 2015, and now we can look forward to the same in Western Australia.\n\n\"We anticipate an excellent match against Perth Glory in what promises to be a fantastic new venue for the city.\"\n\nGlory CEO Peter Filopoulos said it was a great opportunity for sports fans from Australia and the Asia-Pacific region to witness \"one of the biggest and best clubs in the world play in our own back yard\". \n\n\"This will not only help grow and foster football in Western Australia but will expose Perth Glory\u2019s brand to a new market and millions of viewers and fans around the globe,\" Filopoulos said. \n\nLast year Tottenham Hotspur flew the Premier League flag in Australia, contesting the International Champions Cup in Melbourne, while in 2015 Manchester City played in the same competition, also at the MCG.\n\nMore than 83,000 fans watched Manchester United play an A-League All-Stars side at ANZ Stadium in Sydney in July 2013, and 95,000 turned out to watch Liverpool beat Melbourne Victory at the MCG just days later.\n\nArsenal are touring later this year, with back-to-back games against Sydney FC and Western Sydney Wanderers lined up for July.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Guardian sport"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports:

And it left Canadian communities confused, alarmed and furious, reassessing both their travel plans and their sense of their place on the continent. \n \n\u201cOur community is very devastated,\u201d said Osman Ali, director of the Somali Canadian Association of Etobicoke, before Flynn\u2019s clarification. \n \nThe policy had seemed to prevent travel by dual-citizen Canadian students and businesspeople living in the U.S., effectively prohibiting them from leaving the country, and dual-citizen Canadians living in Canada who wanted to visit the U.S. The president of the Canadian Science Policy Conference booked his regular flight to a major American science conference in February. Mehrdad Hariri thought he needed to call Air Canada and cancel, and he was stunned. \n \n\u201cAbsolutely shocking,\u201d sad Hariri, a dual Canadian and Iranian citizen. \u201cAbsolutely shocking. It\u2019s so disappointing.\u201d \n \nTrump\u2019s 90-day ban, which he framed as an anti-terror measure, is not aimed specifically at Canadians. It is designed to forbid entry by residents of Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and Libya. \n \nBut to the astonishment of U.S. allies, the Department of Homeland Security announced early Saturday it did not exempt people who are citizens of those countries and also citizens of countries like Canada, France and Australia, which have never been targeted by broad restrictions of this kind. Nor, they said, did it make exceptions for people who hold \u201cgreen cards,\u201d permanent residents who are rigorously vetted. \n \nIt was not the \u201ctotal and complete\u201d Muslim ban Trump promised during a campaign in which he practiced open Islamophobia. But it appeared far more sweeping and punitive than lawmakers, diplomats and lawyers had expected when the details were leaked earlier in the week. \n \n\u201cThere has never been a measure like this before,\u201d said Lorne Waldman, a top Canadian immigration lawyer in Toronto, before the clarification. \u201cOne can only assume that they didn\u2019t fully think through all of the consequences of what they were doing in terms of the havoc it\u2019s going to cause.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt certainly appears to be unprecedented, and it has certainly been both developed and promulgated in an ignorant and chaotic fashion,\u201d said Robert Remes, a veteran immigration lawyer in Washington, before the clarification. \n \nSome of Trump\u2019s most prominent backers had long suggested that the Muslim ban was mere campaign rhetoric, not to be taken literally. Some Canadian Muslims had assumed the same, then woke up Saturday to learn they had been separated from their families. \n   \n\u201cOn our end, we were saying, \u2018That is ridiculous, that is not going to happen, don\u2019t worry.\u2019 But here we are, and it is happening now,\u201d said Mahmoud Allouch, 26, a University of Toronto engineering graduate who works for a Toronto non-profit and has a sister in Washington he can no longer visit. \n \nIranian Canadian Congress president Bijan Ahmadi said Trump had chosen religious and national discrimination over \u201cany credible security assessment of each case of someone who wants to enter the United States.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe believe that our government and all our politicians, all our MPs from different political parties, should be united on this matter, and should condemn this discriminatory policy that the Trump administration has signed and has implemented,\u201d Ahmadi said. \n \nAli said Trump had targeted the \u201cpoor of the poorest, the weak of the weakest.\u201d \n \nCanadian refugee advocates called on Trudeau to consider changes to a 2004 pact, the Safe Third Country Agreement, which prohibits most people who have been in the U.S. from claiming refugee status at the Canadian border. With Trump\u2019s 120-day suspension of all refugee intake, they said, the U.S. no longer qualifies as a safe haven. \n \nOther Canadian politicians spoke out on Saturday. Deepak Obhrai, a Calgary MP and Conservative leadership candidate who was born in Tanzania, wrote on Twitter: \u201cTargeting Muslims for the acts of a few does not fight terrorism.\u201d \n   \nSaskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, another conservative, noted that his province had received 2,000 refugees in the past year. \n \n\u201cWe stand ready to assist fed gov\u2019t re: anyone stranded by the US ban,\u201d he wrote. \n \nToronto Mayor John Tory said the city would continue to welcome immigrants and refugees. \n \n\u201cOur city\u2019s motto is \u2018diversity our strength.\u2019 We understand that as Canadians we are almost all immigrants, and that no one should be excluded on the basis of their ethnicity and nationality,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \nAn anonymous Trump official told the Washington Post that green-card holders would be approved to enter the country on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis. The official insisted, against all evidence, that there were \u201cfew ramifications\u201d to the order. \n \nFor Canadians, the ramifications were immediate and serious. \n \nSoroush Ghodsi, 14, is the precocious entrepreneur behind Slik, a web startup aimed at investors. He is in the process of raising $500,000 from venture capitalists. But most of them are American, and he was born in Canada to Iranian parents. \n \n\u201cBecause of this order, I may not be able to meet the investors and other VCs we are talking to,\u201d he said. \u201cWe even have a commitment from a U.S.-based firm which now seems like I can\u2019t meet anymore.\u201d \n \nElamin Abdelmahmoud, a BuzzFeed News editor in Toronto, said on Twitter: \u201cI went to the US 6 times in 2016. 2 or 3 times were for work. I\u2019ve been in Canada since Grade 8. But I was born in Sudan, so I\u2019m banned.\u201d \n   Delivered daily The Morning Headlines Newsletter   \nThe Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

Sadly Toronto\u2019s revenue toolbox includes only property taxes and user/licensing fees. This makes it an oddity among the world\u2019s great cities in not getting stable revenue from an income tax. \n \nEveryone knows that property taxes are unfair because they have no relation to your ability to pay. In Toronto, land accounts for the bulk of a home\u2019s value so property taxes bear little relationship to the structure families occupy. User and licensing fees are just as bad, discriminating against those with the lowest incomes. \n \nWhy is Toronto stuck with a centuries-old funding model long abandoned by other industrial nations? Why does Queen\u2019s Park believe that it is acceptable to evict people from their homes by steady increases to property taxes or deny them services through unaffordable fees? \n   \nArticle Continued Below \n   \nRather than hammering residents at every turn, why not share the provincial income tax to fund municipal services based on ability to pay? This would address the three major problems we face: income inequality, crumbling infrastructure and disappearing services without adding the bureaucracy of another tax. \n \nToronto doesn\u2019t have the tools it needs but there is nothing preventing the province from fixing this problem. \n \nGary Dale , West Hill \n   \nToronto\u2019s budget process is like a boxing match between two blind men. It looks like we have neither legal nor accounting professionals among our staff of 55,000. \n \nFor those who failed their high school civics class, health and education are among the many responsibilities of the provincial government; and property taxes are supposed to fund municipal services. \n \nThe City of Toronto directly funds 25 per cent of public health. The City\u2019s subsidy to colleges, universities, hospitals, and correctional facilities approaches $1-billion a year. City of Toronto property taxes directly fund 50 per cent of school budgets. The education tax rate, set by the province and applied to commercial properties in Toronto, is the highest in the GTA. \n \nDespite the direct municipal financial contributions to provincial mandates, there has been no acknowledgement or official documentation of such municipal funding. One should be very leery of any organization that does not document receipts. Intentional omissions deceive the public. Even Statistics Canada (Catalogue no. 13-015-X ISSN: 1710-9264, p.18) has missed the municipal contributions to health and education \u2013 posting contributions from municipal governments as zero. \n \nEqually important, all governments have failed to capture any of the more than $150-billion that have been permitted to escape taxation every year. That\u2019s a lot of subways! \n \nRegrettably, accounting, accountability, transparency, enforcement of legal mandates, and logic are all absent in municipal decision-making. Those who look to the City for municipal services and those who answer for municipal decisions should aim their energies in more effective directions. \n \nStella Kargiannakis , Toronto \n \nMayor John Tory continues shaving the truth. No property tax increase above 2 per cent \u2014 excluding the half-per cent to begin paying for Scarborough\u2019s one-stop subway. That\u2019s the best public transportation deal for Toronto\u2019s northeast, he says. Except it isn\u2019t and already exceeds $3 billion and counting. \n \nHe asked every city department to cut 2.6 per cent of their budget, but skipped Police Services, the single largest component. Now he says Toronto\u2019s solid-waste employees earn about what private companies pay their workers. Yes, if pensions and benefits aren\u2019t counted in. \n \nBut hey, \u201cthere\u2019s no moral dimension to it,\u201d he says. \n \nBernard Katz , Toronto \n   Delivered daily The Morning Headlines Newsletter   \nThe Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

Federal judges in Virginia, Massachusetts, and Washington also made emergency rulings on various aspects of the executive order. \n \nThe ACLU had filed a habeas corpus petition on behalf of two Iraqi refugees, who were detained by border agents at John F. Kennedy airport in New York City, despite having previously been granted asylum and holding valid visas. Both men were released Saturday. \n \n\u201cThere is imminent danger that, absent the stay of removal, there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject to the January 27, 2017, Executive Order,\u201d US District Judge Ann Donnelly said in her ruling . \n \nThe court order will \u201cnot allow the government to remove anybody who has come and is caught up in the order nationwide. They cannot remove anybody,\u201d Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said in a video posted by the organization. \u201cThe key tonight was to make sure no one was put back on a plane.\u201d \n \nGelernt also said the court ordered the government to give the ACLU a list of names of the people who are being detained, and that \u201cat a minimum\u201d they will not be returned. \n \nAt the  US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia , Judge Leonie Brinkema ordered that \u201call legal permanent residents being detained at Dulles International Airport\u201d be permitted to recieve access to lawyers, BuzzFeed\u2019s Chris Geidner reported . Brinkema also issued an order blocking for seven days the removal of any permanent residents being detained at Dulles International Airport, the Washington Post reported . \n \nIn Washington, US District Judge Thomas Zilly granted an emergency stay on the order to deport two unnamed individuals. \n \nIn Massachusetts, US District Judge Allison Burroughs andd Magistrate Judge Judith G. Dein ruled early Sunday morning for a stay expanded to lawful permanent US residents. The judges also ruled that people could not be detained, removed, or interrogated under the authority of the executive order, according to freelance reporter Joshua Eaton , who was at the courthouse. \n \nThe ACLU of Massachusetts, along with other immigration lawyers, filed the suit in federal court on behalf of two detained Iranian professors . Mazdak Pourabdollah Tootkaboni and Arghavan Louhghalam, two associate professors at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth who are both Iranian nationals and lawful permanent US residents were being detained at Logan Airport in Boston as of Saturday evening. \n \nIn a statement , ACLU executive director Anthony Romero slammed Trump for suffering \u201chis first loss in court\u201d in his first week in office. \n \n\u201cClearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country.

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n \n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n \n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n \nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n \n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n \n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\" \n \n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Special Broadcasting Service","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662250","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"168"},"name":"Special Broadcasting Service","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sbs.com.au/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194673865","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A middle-of-the-night lawsuit filed on behalf of two Iraqi men challenged Trump's executive action, which was signed on Friday and initially cast as applying to refugees and migrants.\n\nAmid mounting chaos a US federal judge issued an emergency stay that temporarily blocked the government from sending people out of the country after they have landed at a US airport with valid visas.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union estimated the stay would affect 100 to 200 people detained at US airports or in transit, but government lawyers could not confirm that number.\n\nJudge Ann Donnelly of the US District Court in New York made the order on Saturday.\n\nAs the day progressed, administration officials had confirmed that the sweeping order also targeted US legal residents from the named countries - green-card holders - who happened to be abroad when it was signed. Also subject to being barred entry into the US are dual nationals, or people born in one of the seven countries who hold passports even from US allies such as Britain.\n\nAmong those blindsided were 50 people detained at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.\n\nDozens of people showed up there in support of Muslim families, some carrying signs protesting Friday's order.\n\n\"Refugees are welcome here!\" one read, and another said: \"We turned Jews back, now Muslims?\"\n\nThe growing crowd in Terminal D erupted into jubilant chants of \"USA! USA! USA!\" when Arya Neal Behgooy of Plano and his wife, Shima, emerged from the door that spits out international travellers.\n\nArya Behgooy is a US citizen. Shima Behgooy is a green-card holder from Iran.\n\nAhmad Behgooy embraced Arya, his son. Shima dissolved into the arms of her mother-in-law, Afsaneh Behgooy, who was holding a bouquet of roses that had begun to wilt during the hours-long wait.\n\nShima and her husband had flown from Tehran to Frankfurt, Germany. Mid-flight on their way to Dallas, the couple learned about the ban on travellers from Iran, including green-card holders.\n\nImmigration officers ultimately gave Shima an exemption, her husband said, though he noted that 30 to 40 other travellers were still being held.\n\nDallas mayor Mike Rawlings made his feelings about Trump's order known at a downtown news conference on Saturday night.\n\n\"It's just not good for our city. It's not good for the state,\" Rawlings said. \"This is not a solution. This is a foul insult to the rest of the country.\"\n\nMiriam Yasin was eventually reunited with her 54-year-old mother, Najah al-Shamieh.\n\n\"It feels so good, but it's sad for the other ones,\" Yasin said, the crowd cheering at their tearful reunion. \"I feel like I want to stay here for the other ones.\"\n\nAlia Salem, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), said about 50 people had been detained at Dallas-Fort Worth on Saturday morning.\n\nBy midafternoon that number was down to nine, some joined by local family members in a detention area at the airport.\n\nThe virtually unprecedented measures triggered harsh reactions not only from Democrats and others who typically advocate for immigrants but also key sectors of the US business community. Leading technology companies recalled scores of overseas employees and sharply criticised the President. Legal experts forecast a wave of litigation over the order, calling it unconstitutional. Canada announced it would accept asylum applications from US green-card holders.\n\nYet Trump, who centred his campaign in part on his vow to crack down on illegal immigrants and , was unbowed. As White House officials insisted that the measure strengthens national security, the President stood squarely behind it.\n\n\"It's not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"You see it at the airports, you see it all over. It's working out very nicely, and we're going to have a very, very strict ban, and we're going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.\"\n\nGovernor Cuomo, protecting the right to protest. #MuslimBan pic.twitter.com/KWnBAHCFRc\n\nThough several congressional Republicans denounced the order, the vast majority remained silent and a few voiced crucial support - including, most prominently, House Speaker Paul Ryan, who had rejected Trump's anti-Muslim proposals during the campaign.\n\n\"This is not a religious test, and it is not a ban on people of any religion,'' Ryan said on Saturday. \"This order does not affect the vast majority of Muslims in the world.\"\n\nThe President's order suspends admission to the US of all refugees for 120 days and bars for 90 days the entry of any citizen from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia. That list excludes several majority-Muslim nations - notably Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia - where the Trump Organisation, now run by the President's sons, is active and which in some cases have also faced troublesome issues with terrorism.\n\nAccording to the text of the order, the restriction applies to countries that have already been excluded from programs allowing people to travel to the US without a visa because of terrorism concerns. Hewing closely to nations already named as terrorism concerns elsewhere in law might have allowed the White House to avoid angering majority-Muslim allies such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n\nJanuary 28, 2017. #muslimban #nobannowall JFK O'Hare BOS DFW SFO SEA Dulles DEN LAX pic.twitter.com/zzduGp9AqP\n\nAmid widespread confusion on Saturday about how the order will be enforced, some administration officials acknowledged that its rollout had been chaotic. Officials tried to reassure travellers and their families, pointing out that green-card holders in the United States will not be affected and noting that the Department of Homeland Security is allowed to grant waivers to those individuals and others deemed to not pose a security threat. It can take years for someone to become a green-card holder, or lawful permanent resident authorised to permanently live and work in the country.\n\n\"If you've been living in the United States for 15 years and you own a business and your family is here, will you be granted a waiver? I'm assuming yes, but we are working that out,'' said one official, who could not be more specific because details remained so cloudy.\n\nLove is what makes America great! This is happening at Dulles right now. #MuslimBan #Dulles #NoBanNoWall pic.twitter.com/WP3XrzeCeo\n\nA senior White House official later said that waivers will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and that green-card holders in the United States will have to meet with a consular officer before leaving the country.\n\nBut officials made clear that the federal officers detaining refugees and migrants with valid US visas and restricting them from entering the country were following orders handed down by top Homeland Security officials, at the White House's behest.\n\nMore than 4000 academics from universities nationwide signed a statement of opposition and voiced concern the ban would become permanent. They described it as discriminatory and \"inhumane, ineffective and un-American\".\n\nThe executive action has caused \"complete chaos\" and torn apart families, said Abed Ayoub, legal and policy director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.\n\nAt Dulles International Airport, Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe addressed more than 100 people protesting Trump's order.\n\n\"We want to know who is being detained and why they are being detained,\" McAuliffe said. \"I remind everybody we are a land of immigrants. . . . Discriminatory tactics breed hatred.''\n\nHis remarks were cheered by demonstrators holding signs saying \"Refugees welcome here\" and \"Stand with Muslims\".\n\nProtesters lock hands and circle around people praying at Denver International Airport. #MuslimBan #resist #Colorado pic.twitter.com/6wLxHRzvmu\n\nIn New York City, lawyers for two Iraqi men detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport - one of whom, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, served the US military mission in Iraq - filed a federal lawsuit challenging the order as unconstitutional. They also are seeking class certification so they may represent all refugees and visa-holders who are being held at US ports of entry.\n\n\"We have a moral obligation to protect and repay these people who risked their lives for US troops,\" said Brandon Friedman, who, as an infantry lieutenant with the 101st Airborne Division, worked with Darweesh in Iraq. \n\n\"There are not many Americans who have done as much for this country as he has. He's put himself on the line,\" Friedman added. \"He's put his family on the line to help US soldiers in combat, and it is astonishing to me that this country would suddenly not allow people like that in.\"\n\nOutside the terminal, Darweesh was greeted by his advocates after nearly 19 hours in detention, as well as protesters opposed to the Trump policy who had come to the airport to support him and the others who had been detained.\n\nAlthough shaken, Darweesh paused to speak to the media before moving on to reunite with his family. A reporter asked if he was angry. \"No, because I have these people,\" he said, gripping his lawyer's shoulder. \"This is America.\"\n\nWhile immigration advocates said at least one refugee family had been detained at San Francisco International Airport, there was no immediate count of how many refugees were being held at airports nationwide. Advocates said that ticketed passengers also had been barred from boarding US-bound flights overseas, and they confirmed that green-card holders who left the United States have been unable to return.\n\nIn Cairo, airport officials said seven US-bound migrants - six from Iraq and one from Yemen - were prevented Saturday from boarding an EgyptAir flight to JFK Airport, according to the Associated Press.\n\nOther advocates promised further legal challenges. CAIR said it would file a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional.\n\n\"There is no evidence that refugees - the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation - are a threat to national security,\" said Lena Masri, CAIR's national litigation director. \"This is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\"\n\nIn a conference call with reporters, immigration lawyers and advocates said Trump's order violated the Constitution, along with US and international laws that guarantee migrants the right to apply for asylum at the border and the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which forbids discrimination in the issuance of visas based on race, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.\n\nBut Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Centre for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels, praised Trump for taking action to pause the refugee resettlement program and limit immigration from the seven countries.\n\n\"It's a prudent measure,\" he said. \"It's not the end of the world. It's not the Statue of Liberty crying. The reaction has been hyperbolic.\"\n\nThe effects of Trump's order played out nationwide.\n\nIn Dallas, Behzad Honarjou, 43, was supposed to pick up his mother, 70-year-old Shahin Haffanpour, at the airport on Saturday. But when she arrived from Iran via Dubai, she was told that because of the executive order she would be sent back to Iran the next morning.\n\n\"I don't know what to do,\" Honarjou said. He said he was seeking an attorney to file an emergency habeas petition, but the courts were closed. Haffanpour has an immigrant's visa issued by the US embassy in Ankara, Turkey, last year.\n\nIn Philadelphia, Sarah Assali said six relatives from Syria - two uncles, their wives and two cousins - were detained after arriving at the airport there early Saturday. Although they are Christian immigrants with valid visas to join family in this country, they were put on a plane back to Doha, Qatar, three hours later, Assali said.\n\nShe said her family members were not allowed to call or contact their family in the United States before being removed. \"We don't know what's going to happen next.\"\n\nWashington Post, New York Times, Dallas Morning News","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jerry Markon, Emma Brown and David Nakamura"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Turkey news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Judge orders stay on Trump's ban as protesters flood airports","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Melbourne Age","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169652301","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3545"},"name":"Melbourne Age","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theage.com.au/","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/hashtag/MuslimBan?src=hash","https://t.co/KWnBAHCFRc","https://twitter.com/hashtag/muslimban?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/nobannowall?src=hash","https://t.co/zzduGp9AqP","https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dulles?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoBanNoWall?src=hash","https://t.co/WP3XrzeCeo","https://twitter.com/hashtag/resist?src=hash","https://twitter.com/hashtag/Colorado?src=hash","https://t.co/6wLxHRzvmu","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/opinion/trumps-immigration-ban-is-illegal.html"],"sequenceId":"695194682465","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She\u2019s not 6-foot-2, as the University of Washington lists her. \n \n\u201cWithout shoes, I\u2019m 5-11¾,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cWith shoes, maybe 6-1.\u201d \n \nStill, Osahor is an imposing figure on the basketball court. She is a very large woman with a very large game. While the Huskies have the nation\u2019s leading scorer, senior guard Kelsey Plum, who averages 30.7 points, the team also revolves around Osahor, the nation\u2019s leading rebounder. \n \nIn a game against Washington State last week, she grabbed a Pac-12-record 30 rebounds. She\u2019s averaging 14.5 a game; the next best rebounder in the country gets two fewer per game. She\u2019s also averaging 15.5 points. \n \n\u201cShe\u2019s a unique player,\u201d Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer said. \u201cA lot of teams learn the hard way: Don\u2019t let the frame fool you. On top of being very physical, she\u2019s a very cerebral player. She has a nose for the ball and great hands. She just rips the ball. People don\u2019t take it away from her.\u201d \n \nThe No. 10 Cardinal (18-3 overall) will tangle with her and the No. 7 Huskies (20-2) at 5 p.m. Sunday in Seattle. Both teams are tied with Oregon State for first place in the Pac-12 at 8-1. \n \nOpponents tend to underestimate Osahor because of her girth, but as Stanford forward/center Erica McCall says, \u201cThen she makes one move, and they know better. She has so much strength, and she has quick feet.\u201d \n \nPlum and Osahor carried the Huskies to the Final Four last season, and it was Osahor, not Plum, who was the MVP of the Lexington Regional. In those games, Osahor had 19 points and 17 rebounds against Kentucky, and 24 points and 18 rebounds in a win over Stanford. \n \nOver the past couple of years, she has become a national role model for large girls who had rarely seen others with their body type be so successful. \u201cI hear from a lot of parents of kids who have my body frame,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it just shows people can be successful if they work hard.\u201d \n \nShe thinks rebounding is not just a skill but an art. \n \n\u201cA good rebounder knows where the ball is going to go,\u201d she said. \u201cI say it is an art. It\u2019s something you\u2019ve got to do to get on the offensive end. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s dirty work. But it\u2019s something that should be more glorified than it is.\u201d \n \nBeing wide \u201chelps me, but I have good hands too. There are people who can jump over you. I\u2019m a lot more agile and quicker than people think.\u201d \n \nAlthough her percentage isn\u2019t great, she has hit 108 three-point shots in her career despite shooting completely flat-footed. She is also an excellent passer. She had 10 assists in one game and nine in another this season. \n \n\u201cI try to see stuff before it happens,\u201d Osahor said. \u201cI\u2019ve been like that since I was 9 years old. I played with the same girls (on the Arizona Warriors club team) for a long time, so we knew what each other would do. Me and Plum have that too.\u201d \n \nHuskies coach Mike Neighbors said he discovered her at St. Mary\u2019s High School in Phoenix because he went to the wrong gym and UW was the only team actively recruiting her. \u201cWe beat absolutely zero people to get her,\u201d he said. \n \nNot true, Osahor says. \u201cMy high school won a national championship my junior year,\u201d she said. \u201cWashington wasn\u2019t the only school. Utah was late coming after me, but I was already leaning to Washington.\u201d \n \nHer career in Seattle took a while to get going. During Osahor\u2019s freshman year, she was hit by a car while riding her bike on campus just before the first scrimmage in late October. She injured her shoulder and was out a month. Shortly after she returned to action, she was diagnosed with a stress fracture in her foot. She missed 24 games in all as a freshman. \n \nYou would have to say she has made up for lost time. \n \nTom FitzGerald is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Announces New Chief Medical Officer, Senior-Level Promotions, and Further Regional Expansion Business Wire India \n \nHealthCare Royalty Partners (\"HCR\") announced several firm developments: \n \nNew Chief Medical Officer: \n \nAs of January 2017, Dr. Warren Cooper has assumed the role of Managing Director and Chief Medical Officer at HCR. Dr. Cooper initially joined the team in 2016, consulting as an Industry Advisor. Dr. Cooper is a UK-trained physician with over 35 years of experience in the global pharmaceutical industry. HCR's senior professionals have known Dr. Cooper for over a decade, working closely with him when he served as CEO of Prism Pharmaceuticals (\"Prism\"), a portfolio company at their prior firm. Prism was a specialty pharmaceutical company that developed the antiarrhythmic agent NEXTERONE, and was ultimately acquired by Baxter International in 2011 for $338 million. Prior to serving as CEO of Prism, Dr. Cooper spent 12 years with Merck, initially as a UK clinical research physician, then as head of European and subsequently Worldwide Clinical Research Operations. Dr. Cooper also previously led AstraMerck's (now AstraZeneca PLC) cardiovascular division. HCR looks forward to drawing on Dr. Cooper's tremendous clinical, regulatory and operational experience as it evaluates new investment opportunities. \n \nInvestment Professional Promotions: \n \nHCR has promoted John Urquhart to a Principal of the firm. Mr. Urquhart was among the first employees at HCR, joining the firm as an analyst in 2007 and re-joining in 2012 after receiving his M.B.A. from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Urquhart has over a decade of healthcare investing experience in the royalty and structured finance market. \n \nHCR has also promoted Anthony Rapsomanikis to Vice President. Mr. Rapsomanikis joined HCR as an Associate in 2012, and was promoted to Director of West Coast Business Development after establishing the firm's San Francisco office in 2015. The San Francisco office launched HCR's strategic initiative to regionalize its business development efforts and better serve the needs of counterparties in key geographic areas. \n \n\"John and Tony's promotions are well deserved and serve as recognition of their growth and contributions to the firm over the past several years,\" commented Clarke Futch, co-founder and Chairman of the Investment Committee at HCR. \n \nRegional Office Expansion: \n \nHCR is pleased to announce its plans to open a Boston, MA office in the first half of 2017, which will be led by John Urquhart. Mr. Urquhart will work closely with Clarke Futch, Paul Hadden (Managing Director - Business Development) and the rest of the senior investment team, most of whom will continue to be based in the firm's headquarters in Stamford, CT. \n \nPaul Hadden commented, \"The opening of our Boston office follows the success of HCR's San Francisco office opening in 2015 and furthers our goal of strengthening local coverage and relationships in the key life science and R&D centers. Recent data shows that Boston and the San Francisco / Bay Area each garnered about one-third of all biotech venture capital investment in 2016 and it is important for us to continue to focus on these markets.\" \n \nAbout HealthCare Royalty Partners \n \nHCR is a private investment firm that purchases royalties and uses debt-like structures to invest in commercial or near-commercial stage life science assets. HCR has $3.4 billion in cumulative capital commitments and is headquartered in Stamford, CT. Over the past decade, HCR's senior professionals have completed more than 60 healthcare investments.

Just ask Rocky Point wrestler Don Hammarth. \n \nThe junior started the day on the wrong side of a devastating pin in the quarterfinal round of the Suffolk dual meet championships against Mount Sinai and then sat through Rocky Point\u2019s win over Connetquot in the semifinal round. \n \n\u201cDon had a bad loss in our win over Mount Sinai and we kept him out against Connetquot,\u201d said Rocky Point coach Darren Goldstein, who has led the Eagles into the county championship three years in a row. \u201cHe had a lot of time to think about it and he refocused. When given the opportunity to redeem himself in the championship, he was incredible.\u201d \n \nHammarth broke open a match tied at 2 with a five-point move in the second period and then cradled Anthony Visto for a pin in 4:20 at 138 pounds to key Rocky Point\u2019s 37-31 win over Hauppauge in Saturday night\u2019s dual meet championship before a crowd of 700 at Suffolk CCC-Brentwood. \n \nIt was Rocky Point\u2019s second straight dual meet title, having beaten Hauppauge 38-33, a year ago. Hammarth\u2019s win gave the Eagles an 11-point lead. \n \nHammarth was especially broken up after losing earlier in the day against his former school. He wrestled for Mount Sinai in eighth and ninth grade, before moving to Nova Scotia for a year and then back to Rocky Point. \n \n\u201cI wanted a chance to redeem myself and contribute to my team,\u201d Hammarth said. \u201cThe day didn\u2019t start well, but it had an amazing end.\u201d \n \nRocky Point (21-1) beat Mount Sinai, 46-19, and eliminated Connetquot, 59-13, before the championship rematch with Hauppauge (16-2). After an opening bout loss at 99 pounds where Hauppauge\u2019s third ranked Luke Smith downed second ranked Justin Amendola, 6-4, Rocky Point reeled off three straight first-period pins for an 18-3 lead. \n \nHauppauge countered when Dan Mauriello pinned Brian Whitman in 1:13 at 126 pounds to make it 18-9. \n \n\u201cWe were strong in the lower weights and they were strong in the middle weights,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cAnd there were a few pivotal bouts.\u201d \n \nRocky Point got a huge boost at 170 pounds when senior Anthony Lucia hit a head chalice for a five-point move with 43 seconds remaining for a 6-1 win over Steven Holder. \n \n\u201cLucia hasn\u2019t wrestled for two years and he\u2019s been an outstanding leader on this team,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a big addition to the lineup and one of the reasons why we\u2019re so good.\u201d \n \nLucia improved to 28-1 with the win. \u201cI countered his move and caught him pretty good,\u201d Lucia said. \u201cI stepped over him for the back points and tried for the pin.\u201d \n \nRocky Point\u2019s Matt Capell clinched the win when he beat Christian Galarza, 3-1, in overtime at 220 pounds.

Bush referred to his visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel and condemned \u201cthe resurgence of anti-Semitism, that same virulent intolerance that led to the Holocaust.\u201d   ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt noted the omission of Jews in the Trump statement in tweets Friday, saying, \u201c@WhiteHouse statement on #HolocaustMemorialDay, misses that it was six million Jews who perished, not just \u2018innocent people'\u201d and \u201cPuzzling and troubling @WhiteHouse #HolocaustMemorialDay stmt has no mention of Jews. GOP and Dem. presidents have done so in the past.\u201d  \nMany Jewish leaders, while acknowledging the persecution and murder of millions of other peoples under the Nazis, have nonetheless insisted that the genocide of the Jews be considered a unique goal of Hitler\u2019s regime. In the past, similar Holocaust commemorative statements that have omitted specific mention of the Jewish victims have been decried as an attempt to \u201cde-Judaize\u201d the horrors of the Nazi era. \n \nIn her response to CNN, Hicks also referred the network to a statement from Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, criticizing Greenblatt and the ADL. \n  \u201cIt does no honor to the millions of Jews murdered in the Holocaust to play politics with their memory,\u201d Lauder said, in a statement issued Saturday. \u201cAny fair reading of the White House statement today on the International Holocaust Memorial Day will see it appropriately commemorates the suffering and the heroism that mark that dark chapter in modern history.\u201d  \u201cThere are enough real anti-Semitism [sic] and true threats facing the Jewish people today. Our community gains nothing if we reach a point where manufactured outrages reduce public sensitivity to the real dangers we confront,\u201d Lauder said.   Pundits on the left and right were critical of the Trump White House statement.  Former Reagan White House speechwriter John Podhoretz called Hicks\u2019s defense of the Trump administration statement \u201cabominable.\u201d  Writing for Commentary, Podhoretz said the omission of the Jews is \u201cthe culmination of decades of ill feeling that seems to center on the idea that the Jews have somehow made unfair \u2018use\u2019  of the Holocaust and it should not \u2018belong\u2019 to them. Someone in that nascent White House thought it was time to reflect that view through the omission of the specifically Jewish quality of the Holocaust.   \n\u201cNow the question is: Who was it?\u201d \n  Josh Marshall, editor and publisher of the liberal website TalkingPointsMemo.com , noted that \u201cit has long been a trope of Holocaust deniers and white nationalists to insist that Jews were only incidentally targeted.\u201d  \nLet's block ads!

The Sunday Telegraph alone carries five photographs and a cartoon of the newest occupant of the Oval Office. The Sun on Sunday also has five photos, although Trump is eclipsed by six pictures of David Beckham on a single page, ahead of his appearance on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs . \n \nSome coverage of Trump\u2019s first week in the White House is scathing. The Observer concludes that the president \u201ccannot be trusted\u201d on issues that affect Britain, describing him as \u201cignorant, prejudiced and vicious in ways that no American leader has been\u201d. \n \nIt reports the case of a Yazidi woman who fled an \u201cIsis massacre in Iraq\u201d, but was not allowed to board a flight to the US to be reunited with her husband. \n \nSunday Mirror columnist Saira Khan describes Trump\u2019s policies as \u201cdamaging, isolationist, racist, sexist, Islamophobic, backward\u201d, and likely to trigger an \u201ceconomic arms race\u201d of tit-for-tat tariffs. \n \nBut in The Sunday Times, historian Niall Ferguson writes that while Trump is a \u201cself-publicist of prodigious talent\u201d, it is important to distinguish his messages to his supporters from the actual process of governing. No-one, writes Ferguson, is yet in a position to know how a Trump presidency will turn out. \n \nThe spectacle of President Trump holding hands with the prime minister in the White House continues to fascinate. The Sunday Telegraph has a cartoon of a serene-looking Mr Trump locking hands with a rather less relaxed Theresa May on one side, and a bare-chested Vladimir Putin on the other, as they gambol through a meadow. \n \nThere\u2019s a possible explanation in The Sunday Express as to why the president took Mrs May\u2019s hand \u2013 and the answer may not be chivalry, as Downing Street has suggested. The paper says it has learned that Mr Trump has a fear of slopes and stairs, known as \u201cbathophobia\u201d, and he merely needed a steadying arm. \n Pregnant mothers and overweight cars  \nThe Mail on Sunday takes aim at what it calls a \u201cludicrous, politically correct directive to placate the transgender lobby\u201d. It says the British Medical Association has told NHS doctors not to call pregnant women \u201cexpectant mothers\u201d, in case the term offends transgender people. \n \nA spokesperson from a transgender support group tells the Mail that the advice to doctors is a \u201cmassive step forwards\u201d in preventing discrimination. But the paper\u2019s leader column says transgender campaigners are not entitled to force their opinions about changing language on to others. \n \nThe Sun on Sunday has a warning about a new obesity epidemic \u2013 but there\u2019s not a hamburger or sugar-packed smoothie in sight.

The Sunday Telegraph alone carries five photographs and a cartoon of the newest occupant of the Oval Office. The Sun on Sunday also has five photos, although Trump is eclipsed by six pictures of David Beckham on a single page, ahead of his appearance on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs . \n \nSome coverage of Trump\u2019s first week in the White House is scathing. The Observer concludes that the president \u201ccannot be trusted\u201d on issues that affect Britain, describing him as \u201cignorant, prejudiced and vicious in ways that no American leader has been\u201d. \n \nIt reports the case of a Yazidi woman who fled an \u201cIsis massacre in Iraq\u201d, but was not allowed to board a flight to the US to be reunited with her husband. \n \nSunday Mirror columnist Saira Khan describes Trump\u2019s policies as \u201cdamaging, isolationist, racist, sexist, Islamophobic, backward\u201d, and likely to trigger an \u201ceconomic arms race\u201d of tit-for-tat tariffs. \n \nBut in The Sunday Times, historian Niall Ferguson writes that while Trump is a \u201cself-publicist of prodigious talent\u201d, it is important to distinguish his messages to his supporters from the actual process of governing. No-one, writes Ferguson, is yet in a position to know how a Trump presidency will turn out. \n \nThe spectacle of President Trump holding hands with the prime minister in the White House continues to fascinate. The Sunday Telegraph has a cartoon of a serene-looking Mr Trump locking hands with a rather less relaxed Theresa May on one side, and a bare-chested Vladimir Putin on the other, as they gambol through a meadow. \n \nThere\u2019s a possible explanation in The Sunday Express as to why the president took Mrs May\u2019s hand \u2013 and the answer may not be chivalry, as Downing Street has suggested. The paper says it has learned that Mr Trump has a fear of slopes and stairs, known as \u201cbathophobia\u201d, and he merely needed a steadying arm. \n Pregnant mothers and overweight cars  \nThe Mail on Sunday takes aim at what it calls a \u201cludicrous, politically correct directive to placate the transgender lobby\u201d. It says the British Medical Association has told NHS doctors not to call pregnant women \u201cexpectant mothers\u201d, in case the term offends transgender people. \n \nA spokesperson from a transgender support group tells the Mail that the advice to doctors is a \u201cmassive step forwards\u201d in preventing discrimination. But the paper\u2019s leader column says transgender campaigners are not entitled to force their opinions about changing language on to others. \n \nThe Sun on Sunday has a warning about a new obesity epidemic \u2013 but there\u2019s not a hamburger or sugar-packed smoothie in sight. The paper reports a survey which suggests cars are getting heavier. \n \nBigger engines, tyres, extra equipment and safety devices such as air bags mean some cars have doubled in weight since they were launched, decades ago. The new Mini, for example, is now more of a maxi, being more than eighty per cent heavier than the lightweight original.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Newspaper headlines: Fury over Trump's refugee ban","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"CA","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"RocketNews","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669883","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"RocketNews","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.rocketnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-38786231","http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38768562","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/29/observer-view-britain-america-theresa-may-donald-trump","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/29/global-fury-donal-trump-us-ban-immigration-muslim-countries","http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/donald-trump-needs-start-acting-9712874","http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/cartoons/","http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/760145/Donald-Trump-Theresa-May-White-House-visit-held-hands","http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4167632/Don-t-call-pregnant-patients-mothers.html"],"sequenceId":"695194700145","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It was my fault and I want to apologise to the travelling fans,\u201d said Frampton, 29. \n\n\u201cI hope we can do it again \u2013 we need to do it again.\u201d \n\nThousands of fans had travelled from Northern Ireland to help create a feverish atmosphere at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. \n\nThey saw Santa Cruz, a three-division champion, get off to a fine start, making better use of his height and reach advantage than he had when he lost to Frampton in July. \n\nFrampton, who had won all 23 of his previous fights as a professional, warmed to his task more after a slow start. \n\nBut he found Santa Cruz, relentless with a productive jab, in determined mood to avenge that points defeat in Brooklyn. \n\nFrampton won some rounds back and finished strongly in the 12th, but Santa Cruz held firm to take the belt. \n\n\u201cMy feet were a bit slow. I needed to let my hands go a bit more when I got close,\u201d added Belfast man Frampton. \n\n\u201cWe had a fantastic training camp, I felt completely prepared. I feel like I\u2019ve let the people down.\u201d \n\nFrampton said he would like Santa Cruz to come to Belfast for the third meeting between the pair. \n\nSanta Cruz said both he and Frampton \u2018deserved\u2019 a third fight. \n\nHe said: He is a great fighter and a great counter-puncher. \n\n\u201cIt was tough to change my style. In my head I wanted to go for it, but I was told to box him and that\u2019s what I did. \n\n\u201cI am a man of my word. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d \n\nAnalysis \u2013 \u2018A non-stop, toe-to-toe, all-Mexican fight\u2019 \n\nFormer unified light-welterweight world champion Amir Khan \n\nI think it\u2019ll probably happen again. Both fighters fought a great fight, it was non-stop, toe-to-toe \u2013 an all-Mexican fight. \n\nIt was always going to be close because they have styles that suit each other. They\u2019ve both got great boxing skills. One\u2019s a fighter, one\u2019s a boxer but then they have to change their skillset and gameplan a bit which makes it tough. \n\nSanta Cruz was not the pressure fighter. He was the one who was moving back. He was the one who was boxing more, but in the first fight he was the one pushing Frampton back and you saw Frampton, in this fight, being more the pressure fighter. \n\nThe best man won but what a great fight it was. \n\nRadio 5 live boxing correspondent Mike Costello \n\nIt was desperately close once again but Santa Cruz has won it on two judges\u2019 scorecards. He\u2019s come back and wrested his belt back. That\u2019s the measure of a great champion. Everything about this suggests a trilogy. \n\nBarry McGuigan, Frampton\u2019s manager, on Sky Sports \n\nThese two young men are fantastic for boxing \u2013 they represent everything that is good about the sport. Carl emptied his tank, but didn\u2019t fight technically as well as he could. But it was a magnificent fight. I thought Leo deserved to win it. \n\nI hope they will go back to Belfast, repaying these travelling fans for spending their hard-earned money. We owe it to them to bring it back to Belfast. \n\nShane McGuigan, Frampton\u2019s trainer, on Sky Sports \n\nNo excuses, it was a nip-and-tuck fight. I think we will get Santa Cruz again, and I know Carl has the ability to beat him again. We weren\u2019t really expecting to box on the back foot, but we were a bit sluggish, he was a bit tired down the stretch but it is one of those things. \n\nReaction on social media \n\nRead More At:  Article Source","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Las Vegas news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Central America news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Mexico news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Carl Frampton v Leo Santa Cruz: Mexican wins Las Vegas rematch","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"CA","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"RocketNews","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669883","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"RocketNews","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.rocketnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194700435","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a US citizen. \n\nPakistan and Saudi Arabia, however, are not on the list of countries subject to the new ban. \n\nThe administration is facing criticism from leaders in the U.S. and around the world for taking steps their critics say are unconstitutional and anti-American. \n\nThe second mention of San Bernardino came when the official was trying to explain why there was no grace period before the executive order went into effect, to help ease implementation. \n\n\"Imagine if this had been an executive order that had been contemplated the day before the San Bernardino shooter entered the United States?\" the official asked. \"Would have delaying its implementation served the best interests of the country? The reality is we don't know who the next individual is who will exploit our immigration programs successfully. If you choose that something is necessary to do for the sake of national security, it should be done immediately.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump official incorrectly justifies travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Missoula","zipCode":"59802","state":"Montana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Missoula","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KECI.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169687287","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"11"},"name":"KECI.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nbcmontana.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194712039","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:05Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://static.lakana.com/bmg-global-us-east-1/photo/2016/04/06/Farook%20and%20Malik%20together_36804152_5747184_ver1.0.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Each year Britons throw away two million tonnes of electronic waste . But is there a solution to dumping them in landfill? \n \nIt can often seem easier \u2013 not to mention cheaper \u2013 to replace old technology with newer, shinier models. \n \nBut a growing number of people are instead choosing to repair their slow computer or failing phone. Events around the UK are springing up, teaching people how to repair their outmoded technology. \n \n\u201cOur mission is for people to keep stuff for longer,\u201d says Janet Gunter, co-founder of the Restart Project in London, which holds community events during which volunteers help people repair their electronics. \n \nThe project began in 2012 and claims it has prevented 1,270kg of electronic items being dumped since then . \n Six repair tips  Check the fuse and swap it for one from another device you know is working  Check the batteries the same way, even if you\u2019ve just bought them  Check the battery holder \u2013 if it\u2019s dirty or is bent out of shape and no longer connecting, clean it or bend it back into shape  If it works intermittently, maybe a wire is loose inside the plug or the wires have got damaged. Confirm this by wriggling the mains lead to see if it temporarily fixes the problem. If so, replace the plug or mains lead  Read the instructions. There may be a fuse inside the device that can be replaced, a reset button hidden somewhere or a setting that needs changing  Take it to a repair group where it can be looked at by an expert  \n\u201cWe encourage [people] to reuse stuff and if something is broken to sell it for parts,\u201d said Ms Gunter. \n \nVolunteer Dave Lukes has been involved for three years, inspired by his passion for the \u201cchallenge of fixing\u201d things, as well as the environmental issues. \n \n\u201cThe amount of stuff we throw away is just ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cThe numbers are just incomprehensible.\u201d \n \nLaptops and games consoles are items people typically want to repair. \n \n\u201cOne of the great things is to see people with things like laptops,\u201d said Mr Lukes. \u201cThey are small enough to be very mysterious, but you can open them up to see what the bits are. \n \n\u201cQuite a few people come through with laptops and they are fascinated that they can fix them with your help. \n \n\u201cIt is very empowering for people to see that they can fix things.\u201d \n \nThe Repair Cafe movement began in Amsterdam in 2009 and has spread around the world, including more than 30 registered groups in the UK. \n \nThe Malvern Hills Repair Cafe , in Worcestershire, was founded in December 2012 and attracts about 50 people each month. \n \nTo date, about 1,500 people have taken along more than 2,200 household and personal items to be examined and assessed. It is used not only use it as an opportunity to fix things, but to meet with like-minded people, enjoy a coffee and make new friends. \n \nRoman Iwanczuk, a retired electronics engineer, has helped out at the cafe since it started. \n \n\u201cI just believe that we throw away far too much stuff that can be relatively easily fixed if you have the knowledge to do so,\u201d he said. \n \nTechnology journalist David McClelland said while finding the time to repair items could be difficult, \u201cvery little beats the sense of satisfaction\u201d of fixing something yourself. \n \nBut he says manufacturers do not make it easy for people to repair devices. \n \n\u201cThe trend for miniaturisation and portability in consumer technology \u2013 squeezing more power, battery life, screen real-estate into ever smaller devices \u2013 means that they become increasingly difficult to repair or replace components,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cTake your new smartphone or tablet for example. \n \n\u201cWhile it\u2019s not impossible to take these complex devices apart \u2013 to replace a cracked screen, for example, or a worn battery \u2013 it\u2019s not something that is actively encouraged. The likes of Apple, Google or Samsung don\u2019t publish the equivalent of a Haynes Workshop Manual for smartphone disassembly, preferring instead that you come to one of their retail stores or service centres; or buy a new model altogether. \n \n\u201cEven if you do persist and open up your phone, repair can be very fiddly requiring specialist tools and custom replacement parts. Again, not impossible, but the bar is fairly high and that\u2019s probably why an industry of smartphone repair shops has popped up.\u201d \n \nBut he adds that repair events are about far more than just fixing things. From community spirit, to helping the environment and retaining important skills. \n \n\u201cRepair cafés help build life-skills and, as they are often organised by local residents and volunteers, community values too,\u201d he added. \n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s more repairs, recycles and upcycles mean fewer items for landfill: good news for the environment.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Electric dreams","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"CA","country":"Canada"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"RocketNews","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169669883","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"7"},"name":"RocketNews","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.rocketnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-37954769","http://www.hse.gov.uk/waste/waste-electrical.htm","https://therestartproject.org/impact-report/","http://www.malvernhillsrepaircafe.co.uk/index.php/2015-10-20-03-59-58/our-history"],"sequenceId":"695194718527","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

major employer of foreign workers, hit back on Saturday at President Donald Trump's sudden executive order on immigration, with some leaders calling it immoral and un-American. \n \nTrump's order temporarily bars citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States even if they hold valid visas or permanent residence permits, a move that caught many companies off-guard. \n \nNetflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings called it \"a sad week\" and added: \"It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.\" \n \nApple CEO Tim Cook sent a letter to employees saying Trump's order was \"not a policy we support\" and promised to help affected employees. \n \n\"We have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our coworkers and our company,\" Cook added. \n \nElon Musk, the South African-born founder of Tesla and SpaceX who met recently with Trump, said on Twitter: \"The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges.\" \n \nAirbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky said: \"Not allowing countries or refugees into America is not right and we must stand with those who are affected.\" \n \nAirbnb will provide free housing to anyone not allowed into the United States, Chesky said. \n \nAaron Levie, the outspoken founder and CEO of online storage company Box Inc, said: \"The executive order on immigration is immoral and antithetical to our values.\" \n \nSTRANDED \n \nFriday's order could be a major headache for tech companies, potentially leaving employees stranded overseas and unable to return to the United States. \n \nAlphabet Inc's Google urgently called back employees from overseas and told ones who might be affected by the ban not to leave the United States. \n \nCEO Sundar Pichai said in an email to staff that more than 100 Google employees were affected by the order, according to a Google executive. \n \nOne Google employee of Iranian nationality with legal US residency made it back to the United States just hours before the order took effect, the executive said. \n \n\"We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US,\" Google said in a statement. \n \nMicrosoft Corp President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a company-wide email posted on LinkedIn that 76 company employees were citizens of the seven countries in question and held US work visas, and thus were directly affected by the order. \n \nHe said the company had not determined how many people with green cards, or permanent residence status, might be affected. \n \n\"As a company, Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system,\" Smith said in the post. \"We believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings.\" \n \nUber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick, who has faced criticism from some employees for participating in President Trump's business advisory council, said in a statement that the company would compensate drivers from the seven countries who might not be able to return to the United States for three months or more. He said the company knew of about a dozen affected employees. \n \n\"This ban will impact many innocent people - an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump\u2019s first business advisory group meeting,\" Kalanick said. \n \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on Friday that was \"concerned\" about the order and voiced support for immigrants.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Tech latest","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US immigration news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"US tech leaders sound alarm over Trump immigration order","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Deccan Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673440","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"137"},"name":"Deccan Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194719097","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And we want to have more minorities, more immigrants, more international connections\u201d \n \nFox News reported that \u201cA proposal for California to secede from the United States was submitted to the Secretary of State\u2019s Office Thursday. \n \n\u201cThe proposed \u201cCalexit\u201d initiative \u2013 its name borrowed from the UK\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d departure from the EU \u2013 would ask voters to repeal part of the state constitution that declares California an inseparable part of the U.S. \n \n\u201cA recent poll found that one in three California residents would support a possible secession from the U.S. due to their opposition to President Trump. No mention has been made of the president in the proposal. \n \n\u201cIf the proposal qualifies for the ballot and is approved by voters, it could be a step to a future vote on whether the state would break away from the rest of the nation. \n \n\u201cSecretary of State Alex Padilla said the group behind the proposal, Yes California Independence Campaign, was cleared to begin attempting to collect nearly 600,000 voter signatures needed to place the plan on the ballot. \n \n\u201cIn our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children,\u201d the Yes campaign\u2019s website says. \n \nSimilar attempts to establish California as a nation, or break it into multiple states, have failed. \n \nThe proposed constitutional amendment, titled California Nationhood, would also ask voters to repeal language that states the U.S. Constitution is the supreme law. If approved, it calls for scheduling a vote in 2019 to ask voters, \u201cShould California become a free, sovereign and independent country?\u201d \n \n\u201cAmerica already hates California, and America votes on emotions,\u201d Marcus Evans, vice president of Yes California told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI think we\u2019d have the votes today if we held it.\u201d \n \nThe campaign must submit the valid voter signatures by July 25 to qualify for the ballot.\u201d \n  Share with friends:   Leave a comment  Tags:  California , NND , Trump   Owolabi Oluwasegun  \nContent creator, aggregator and consultant.

Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2795","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Bathurst","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bathurst Western Advocate","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169713541","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"20"},"name":"Bathurst Western Advocate","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.westernadvocate.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194723401","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2795","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Bathurst","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bathurst Western Advocate","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169713541","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"20"},"name":"Bathurst Western Advocate","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.westernadvocate.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194724210","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

(Photo by AFP) \n \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May has signed a £100 million warplane deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in hopes that the UK will emerge as Turkey\u2019s principal military partner. \n \nThe jet fighter agreement, signed on Saturday, will see the UK\u2019s largest military contractor BAE Systems collaborate with Turkish companies to build a custom-made Turkish warplane, the TF-X, British daily The Guardian reported, underlining that the UK hopes the deal would spark \u201ca longstanding relationship, and open the door to becoming Turkey\u2019s main defense provider.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt marks the start of a new and deeper trading relationship with Turkey and will potentially secure British and Turkish jobs and prosperity for decades to come,\u201d said May, who had earlier laid a wreath at the mausoleum of former Turkish leader Kemal Ataturk.   \n \n\u201cThis agreement underlines once again that Britain is a great, global trading nation and that we are open for business,\u201d added the British prime minister, who aims to demonstrate that the UK can strike lucrative trade deals as it prepares to exit the European Union. \n \n\u201cWe would expect this to unlock further deals,\u201d said a Downing Street spokeswoman as quoted in the report, which noted that besides the warplane deal, May and Erdogan further discussed security cooperation and counter-terrorism, and agreed to form \u201ca joint working group\u201d to begin talks about a bilateral trade deal that could be signed after Brexit. \n British Prime Minister Theresa May (R) bows her head during a wreath laying ceremony at Anitkabir, the mausoleum of Kemal Ataturk on January 28, 2017. (Photo by AFP)  \nThe development came immediately following May\u2019s official visit to Washington, where she held talks with US President Donald Trump. \n \nAccording to the report, May signed the military deal with Turkey despite growing concerns regarding Erdogan\u2019s human rights record \u201cand the increasingly authoritarian tone of his government, which has locked up thousands of political dissidents and protesters.\u201d \n  \nThe spokeswoman insisted that the issues of human rights and trade were distinct saying, \u201cI think those are separate issues; Turkey is an important NATO partner, so our cooperation on both security and defense is in line with that.\u201d \n  \n\u201cThe prime minister\u2019s approach is quite clear; she thinks it is important and in the UK\u2019s interests to engage with Turkey,\u201d she further stated. \n \nAsked about the massive crackdown following the attempted coup against Erdogan\u2019s leadership last year, May\u2019s spokeswoman said, \u201cWe have expressed strong support for Turkey\u2019s democracy and institutions following the coup, but have also been very clear that we urge Turkey\u2019s response to be proportionate and in line with international human rights obligations.\u201d \n \nSpeaking beside Erdogan in his lavish presidential office, May said, \u201cI\u2019m proud that the UK stood with you on July 15 last year in defense of democracy and now it is important that Turkey sustains that democracy by maintaining the rule of law and upholding its international human rights obligations as the government has undertaken to do.\u201d \n \nMay\u2019s remarks on human rights comes despite her total expression of support for Persian Gulf dictatorships such as Saudi Arabia and Bahrain as Britain presses ahead with more weapon sales to both regimes, which are notorious for their grave human rights records in their cruel repression of domestic dissent. ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Turkey news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"UK news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"UK, Turkey sign £100mn warplane deal 7hr","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IR","country":"Iran"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"PressTV.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552639271","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1225"},"name":"PressTV.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://presstv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194725711","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It is reported that the two have become close again, with president Zuma saying that the ruling party is ready for a female leader. \n \nThe Sunday Times said that at least five family members confirmed that Dlamini-Zuma and her children have a house inside Zuma\u2019s Nkandla compound. \n \nZuma\u2019s relatives also noted that Dlamini-Zuma had become \u2018a regular visitor to Nkandla over the past two years\u2019. \n \n\u201cYes, she has a house that she uses in the complex and it\u2019s used by her and her children whenever they are around,\u201d one relative said. \n \n\u201cIn Zulu culture there\u2019s no divorce. Nothing happens here without her knowing. Even when we have functions she comes and she has a house,\u201d a source told the paper. \n \nDlamini-Zuma\u2019s spokesman, Vukani Lumumba Mthintso, however, denied that she has a house in Nkandla. \u201cBut the chairperson lives in Addis Ababa, not in Nkandla,\u201d he said. \n \nEarlier this week, EFF leader Julius Malema weighed in on the ANC succession debate ahead of the ruling party\u2019s 54th national elective conference in December. \n \n\u201cNkosazana Dlamini-Zuma will be president if Zuma wants her to be,\u201d said Malema. \n \nBut the EFF commander-in-chief said if she does emerge victorious it would have little to do with affirming her abilities to lead the party as its first female president. \n \n\u201cThat thing of South Africa being ready for a female president is just rhetoric. He\u2019s trying to sound smart, to appear like he supports women,\u201d Malema said. \n \nHe claimed Dlamini-Zuma\u2019s task, if she does take over from Zuma, would be to protect him from facing corruption charges. \n \nAccording to Nomura analyst, Peter Attard Montalto, the outcome to the presidential run for control of the ANC is ultimately tipped in Zuma\u2019s favour, because an elective conference is essentially an aggregation of the ANC at branch level. \n \nThe elective conference will not be decided by set piece speeches, media or other forum \u2013 it will be the personal gerrymandering of individual branch level votes, Attard Montalto said in a recent note. \n \n\u201cWe think the Zuma camp could \u2018play dirty\u2019 in a way the anti-Zuma camp would be less inclined to. This will play to Zuma\u2019s ultimate skill, which is internal party management. \n \n\u201cAs such a key but likely largely overlooked issue in 2017 would be the ebb and flow of branch level structures \u2013 some get shut, others are opened, leadership at branch level gets cycled over, sometimes violently, provincial structures are brought to bear at the branch level. \n \n\u201cThis is how the Zuma camp could win \u2013 and is why we think the most likely outcome is that they will,\u201d he said. \n \nThe following report is can be found in the 29 January 2017 edition of the Sunday Times. \n \nRead: Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma will be president if Zuma wants her to be \u2013 Malema","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"South Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"ANC presidential candidate has a home at Nkandla compound","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Businesstech.co.za","feed":{"genre":"Press Release","tags":[],"id":"237387006","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"10"},"name":"Businesstech.co.za","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.businesstech.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194726571","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:53:17Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Those who observe the Chinese New Year will continue celebrating in the days to come with dancing, music, costumes, parades, gifts and fireworks to honor the times. Fire represents high energy, passion and transformation. The rooster symbolizes confidence, dominance and power. \n \nARIES (March 21-April 19). There's danger in weighing in too soon, judging too quickly and reacting too impulsively. You won't be sorry for asking a few more questions, taking your time and withholding your opinion until you get all of the facts. \n \nTAURUS (April 20-May 20). You can be the star, but you can just as readily be the cheerleader, coach or motivational force to another person's performance. When you interact with others, your goal is to help them win. \n \nGEMINI (May 21-June 21). Some things you've seen lately definitely look better in pictures than in real life. But tonight you'll witness what simply can't be captured with a camera, no matter how good the lens is or whose eye is behind it. \n \nCANCER (June 22-July 22). You're the purveyor of good taste and consumer quality in your group. You'll take the responsibility seriously today, vetting the options carefully and giving a full report to interested parties. \n \nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22). You're not afraid of being proved wrong. In fact, you look forward to anything enlightening. That said, you will quietly hold to what you feel is right until anything that is truer can convince you otherwise. \n \nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). Everyone is selling something, although some are doing it so badly (and others are doing it so well) that it's hard to tell. What are you selling? If you don't know what it is, it's hard to get the right price. \n \nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). You want freedom; you need rules; you long for adventure; you're drawn to comforts. All these contrasts are working in your life, and you're better for the complexity. \n \nSCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). Life seems to be going to plan, the only problem being that the plan in question isn't your own. Take back the reins. Step one: Determine who has them. Step two: Wrestle. \n \nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). Making friends isn't so hard for you, and neither is keeping them, though the latter takes more of a conscious effort. Decide on a pattern that works for you, and hope it matches the needs of the other people. \n \nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). Charisma is yours to wield today, so which direction should you wield it? Do you aim it for the low-hanging fruit, or are you willing to climb a bit? Hint: The one who is difficult to win will be won over by you right quick. \n \nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). Tricks to stop the energy-draining habit of worry: Write it down and burn it. Distract yourself with overwhelming entertainment. Change the channel. Solve the problem. \n \nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20). You are, at times, helplessly, even unwillingly, empathetic. It's usually when another person seems to need your protection. A baby crying, an animal hurting \u2014 you'll feel it immediately. \n \nTODAY'S BIRTHDAY (Jan. 29). With a habit of gratitude, you'll find it easy to rejoice in your life this year. There's a deal to be struck in March \u2014 lucrative for you and a godsend for the other person. April is a kind of free-for-all. The rules get bent, and the professional climate shifts, and all the changes stir up interesting relationships. Aries and Virgo adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 45, 9, 31, 20 and 14. \n \nFORECAST FOR THE WEEK AHEAD: The Year of the Fire Rooster is underway! The official calendar of China is the Gregorian calendar, but the ancient Chinese calendar, which is based on astronomical phenomena, is widely used for traditional activities \u2014 including the celebration of Spring Festival, aka Lunar New Year. The first day of the new year is the new moon in Aquarius, which was yesterday. Celebrations and traditions continue for the next two weeks. Ancestors will be paid homage to. Deities will be honored. Dragons will tour the streets, and lanterns will light up the sky to welcome the Year of the Fire Rooster. \n \nIn Chinese astrology, the element of fire is the second of five stages of chi, which is energy. Fire represents the prosperity phase of matter. Combined with the rooster symbol, this is a kind of double energetic whammy, adding some crackle-pop! to the cock-a-doodle-doo. \n \nIn world politics, small social groups and everything in between, leaders will strut and posture. Divas abound. Authority figures lay down rules and diktats that underlings scramble to build order around. The omens suggest excitement, abundance and spectacle in the months ahead. \n \nCELEBRITY PROFILES: Oprah Winfrey built an empire around her own intimate and honest style of communicating. The mogul and philanthropist was born when the sun, Mercury and Venus were all in the sign of Aquarius. Also known as the Water Bearer, Aquarius is the great humanitarian of the zodiac, finding a deep sense of purpose in bringing people what they need. \n \nTo write to Holiday Mathis, visit www.creators.com/author/holiday-mathis and click \"Contact.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Welcoming the Fire Rooster","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Creators.com","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169837318","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2771"},"name":"Creators.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.creators.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194726765","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Twice each year, the statewide roundtable meets with the CPW director and other members of CPW\u2019s leadership for detailed discussions about a variety of wildlife management challenges. \n \nSpruce beetle most damaging pest in 2016 \n \nThe spruce beetle was the most damaging forest insect pest in Colorado for the fifth consecutive year, based on a 2016 forest health aerial survey conducted by the Colorado State Forest Service and U.S. Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Region. \n \nDouglas fir beetle populations also continued to expand and mountain pine beetle, western spruce budworm and Douglas-fir tussock moth populations continued to decline. \n \nSpruce beetle populations continued to cause widespread tree mortality, impacting 350,000 acres of higher-elevation stands of Engelmann spruce statewide. The largest infestations were detected primarily in southern and central Colorado, with more than one-third of those acres \u201cnew\u201d or not previously affected. \n \nSince 1996, spruce beetle outbreaks have caused tree mortality on more than 1.7 million acres in Colorado. \n \nThe aerial survey also indicated that activity of Douglas-fir beetle, a close relative of spruce beetle that attacks and kills mature Douglas-fir trees, significantly increased on the Western Slope, with 19,000 acres affected. Eagle, Garfield and Pitkin counties, along with most of the Gunnison Basin, were all heavily impacted with pocket activity in 2016. \n \nMountain pine beetle, which affected nearly 3.4 million cumulative acres statewide over the past two decades, also has declined for years and remains at background levels, with fewer than a thousand acres affected statewide in 2016. \n \nTo obtain local 2016 Aerial Detection Survey information, contact the nearest CSFS office. \n \nReserve camping spots in state parks now \n \nThe time is now to make reservations for popular camping locations in the spring and summer. \n \nColorado Parks and Wildlife officials say many state park camping locations are already booked over Memorial Day but there are still some prime locations for the July 4 holiday. \n \n\u201cCamping spots in parks near Denver are often booked six months in advance, so planning ahead is the best way to secure a prime spot,\u201d said Margaret Taylor, CPW assistant director for capital, parks and trails. \u201cCabins and yurts are typically booked first, followed by sites with electrical and water hook-ups and then tent camping sites.\u201d \n \nOver Memorial Day weekend, only three state parks still have wide availability: Mancos State Park, Paonia State Park and Yampa River State Park. \n \nMancos, which is a 40-minute drive west of Durango, offers yurts as well as tent camping. \n \nTo make camping reservations, go to the CPW website or by call 303-470-1144 (Denver) or 1-800-678-2267, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. \n \nColorado has 42 state parks with multiple options for RV hookups, camp sites, cabins and yurts.

Elk Foundation, landowners protect nearly 1,800 acres \n \nThe Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation teamed up with conservation-minded landowners and Colorado Parks and Wildlife to permanently protect 1,742 acres of prime elk and greater sage grouse habitat in northwest Colorado. The tract is nearly surrounded by public lands. It is also adjacent to the Diamond Breaks Wilderness Study Area and only a few miles away from Dinosaur National Monument and Browns Park National Wildlife Refuge. \n \nThe property is key summer and winter range for big game and home to more than 500 elk as well as mule deer and other bird and animal life. It is also central greater sage grouse range and lies within a two-mile radius of leks in both Colorado and Utah, one of which contains more than 60 males. \n \nThough the conservation easement is on private property, the landowner granted a public access easement to CPW allowing public elk hunts every year going forward in the highly limited draw unit of Game Management Unit 1. \n \nThe landowner previously placed a RMEF conservation easement on a 796-acre plot of adjacent ranch land immediately across the border in Utah.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"StaffSaturday, January"},"topics":[],"title":"Outside Briefs, Jan. 28, 2017","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Montrose","zipCode":"81401","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Montrose","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683150","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1618"},"name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gjsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194731676","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:46:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Marc Catlin \n  \n   \nRep. Patrick Neville \n  \n  \nBy Charles Ashby \nSaturday, January 28, 2017 \n \nDENVER \u2014 The new leader of the House Republicans isn\u2019t earning a lot of friends on the Western Slope. \n \nThat\u2019s because many people are upset that House Minority Leader Patrick Neville, R-Castle Rock, didn\u2019t appoint his caucus\u2019 newest member, Rep. Marc Catlin, R-Montrose, to the House Agriculture, Livestock & Natural Resources Committee. \n \nThey considered it a no-brainer that Catlin would gain such an appointment. He is an undisputed expert in water issues, particularly on the Western Slope, \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d said Christian Reece, executive director of Club 20, a Western Slope advocacy group. \u201cThe committee and the House as a whole would benefit greatly if they used his skills. One would think that appointments would be based on a legislator\u2019s skill set. With attempts to implement the statewide water plan this year, it\u2019s important to have a strong voice from the Western Slope on such a committee.\u201d \n \nInstead of being appointed to the ag panel and the House Transportation Committee \u2014 as his predecessor, now Sen. Don Coram, R-Montrose, was \u2014 Catlin was assigned to the House Public Health Care & Human Services Committee and House Finance Committee. \n \nCatlin has no health care, social service or financial background. Instead, he is an acclaimed expert on water issues. \n \nHis job outside of public service is as water rights development coordinator for Montrose County. He also is a former manager of the Uncompahgre Valley Water Users\u2019 Association and a longtime member of the Colorado River Water Conservation District board of directors. \n \nNeville, who refused to be interviewed for this story, has sole discretion over what committees members of his caucus get. But because Republicans lost seats in the House in last year\u2019s elections, that also meant there are fewer seats in House committees for GOP members. \n \nAs a result, coveted committees such as agriculture and transportation end up going to more senior members. \n \nStill, not including someone such as Catlin is a hard pill for Western Slope legislators to swallow because of his vast knowledge on water law, especially when considering who else is on the panel, those lawmakers said. \n \nThe 13-member committee is dominated by lawmakers who hail not just from the Front Range, but from the South Platte River Basin. That\u2019s the region that has the highest population and the greatest need for more municipal water supplies. \n \nThe rest break down to two for the Colorado River basin on the Western Slope, two in the Arkansas River basin in southeast Colorado, and one in the Rio Grande River basin in the San Luis Valley. \n \nThat means when water issues \u2014 which historically divide along basin lines rather than political ones \u2014 come up for votes, the northern Front Range region out-votes the other basins combined, 8-6. \n \nThe Western Slope lawmakers on the panel are Reps. Yeulin Willett, R-Grand Junction, and Diane Mitch Busch, D-Steamboat Springs, both of whom agreed that Catlin\u2019s voice on the panel would be welcomed. \n \nChris Treese, executive director of the Colorado River Water Conservation District, said the Western Slope deserves a greater voice on that committee because the bulk of the state\u2019s water is located here. And someone like Catlin, who has more direct experience with water issues than Willett, an attorney, or Mitch Busch, whose background is in sociology, can speak more knowledgeably about the subject, Treese said. \n \n\u201cMarc\u2019s whole life has been water, Marc\u2019s family has been water, is water, and for the sake of the House ag committee and for the sake of the whole General Assembly, his expertise is being wasted,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the perspective of his district, the vacancy committee elected him in large measure because of that significant background, that natural resource, water-specific background. I know they are disappointed that he is not being assigned in a way that\u2019s consistent with the talents that he brings to the Legislature.\u201d \n \nMontrose rancher Jay Jutten, a Republican, said people like him look to their elected officials to represent them in far-away Denver, and now is not so sure he\u2019s getting that. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re over here in the back 40 and we see the Front Range getting a lot of attention,\u201d he said. \u201cThe representation we get, we need them on those committees that are important to us. I\u2019m not saying that the committees Representative Catlin is on aren\u2019t important, but agriculture is huge, transportation is huge for the Western Slope.\u201d \n \nBoth Treese and Reece have sent letters to Neville in recent weeks asking him to reconsider Catlin\u2019s appointments. Neville hasn\u2019t yet responded to either. \n \nAs a result, Reece sent a similar letter to other House Republican leaders, two of whom, Reps. Lori Saine of Dacono and Perry Buck of Windsor, sit on the ag committee. \n \nCoram, who replaced Sen. Ellen Roberts, R-Durango, when she resigned her seat in December, creating the vacancy for Catlin, said he\u2019s been getting dozens of emails and telephone calls about the matter. \n \nCoram, who sat on the agriculture and transportation committees when he served in the House, was assigned to the Senate ag committee when he switched to the Senate. \n \nHe said he\u2019s aghast at Neville\u2019s assignments not only for the ag committee, but transportation, too. \n \n\u201cLooking back at the ag committee for as long as I can remember going back to the \u201860s, there has never been a time a Western Slope Republican agricultural person has not been on the committee,\u201d Coram said. \u201cAnd there was never a time when there wasn\u2019t a Western Slope Republican on the transportation committee.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Charles AshbySaturday, January"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"House GOP leader under fire for panel assignments","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Montrose","zipCode":"81401","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Montrose","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683150","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1618"},"name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gjsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194732451","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:04:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Powderhorn is a great resort for those seeking a good place to ski. There are plenty of runs for all levels and abilities and it is more affordable than other resorts in the state. For those who are new to skiing, some of the most basic questions need to be answered before hitting the slopes \u2014 like where to ski. \n  \n   \nSuzanne Foster Porter keeps an eye on her son, Elliot, 4, during a recent run at Powderhorn Mountain Resort. Elliot is showcasing the wedge, the best way to stop on skis. \n  \n   \nWhether skiing or snowboarding, the most important thing to do is stay safe. That means controlling your speed and wearing a helmet. \n  \n  \nBy Julie Norman \nSaturday, January 28, 2017 \n \nI was researching content marketing for my \u201creal\u201d job here at The Daily Sentinel and found this interesting tool called \u201cAnswer the Public\u201d (askthepublic.com). It\u2019s a way to use keywords to identify questions that have been asked online about a particular topic. Since it\u2019s winter and I\u2019m not mountain biking, I used \u201cskiing\u201d as my keyword and discovered that most of the questions people seem to ask are very basic ones. \n \nThat makes sense to me because, well, sometimes you don\u2019t want people to think you don\u2019t know things; that\u2019s what makes the internet great. So here are the answers to some of those questions I found. I hope those of you reading can find them useful or put them in the hands of those who will. \n \nWhen skiing, how do you stop? I saw this in several variations. To stop when skiing, you can either wedge your skis (push your heels out) to form a \u201cpizza\u201d slice, or you can use a \u201chockey stop.\u201d This requires knowing how to turn. If you can turn, do that and then push your heels down and the edges of your skis into the hill. If neither of those options works, just sit down, but make sure your skis are pointing across the hill, not down it! \n \nWhy is skiing so much fun? I think that answer probably differs from person to person. I like the challenge of it and I enjoy the scenery. If you\u2019re skiing, chances are you\u2019re in a beautiful place! It\u2019s also exhilarating to swish down a slope (staying in control of course) or glide through untracked powder. It\u2019s also a great digital break; I cannot ski and text at the same time. Honestly, it\u2019s just fun! If you need to ask the question, maybe it\u2019s not the sport for you. \n \nWhat is the fall line? The fall line is the direction of the slope or, the direction gravity leads you as you\u2019re skiing down it. Sometimes portions of slopes can have a \u201cdouble fall line\u201d which means that it has a standard downhill slope, but also that part of the run may be angled to one side (Maverick and Red Eye at Powderhorn have this feature in places). \n \nWhat is carving? Carving refers to a type of ski turn. When you tip your skis onto the edges, the sidecut of your skis causes them to bend and an arc to form. The ski then follows this arc to produce a turn. \n \nHow do I control my speed? Make another turn. You can also slow your turns by making wider turns (though this can cause more harm than good sometimes because if you turn too wide and slow down too much you won\u2019t be able to make the next turn). \n \nWhere are the best places to ski? This is a totally subjective question based on where you live, the type of terrain you enjoy, and how long you\u2019ve been skiing. If you live here on the Western Slope, the best place to ski is Powderhorn. It\u2019s easily accessible, has beginner, intermediate, and expert terrain, and is more affordable than large resorts. \n \nIf you don\u2019t mind traveling a bit, Snowmass is another great option but again, that\u2019s my own opinion. If you\u2019re looking for unique places to ski, do some online research to learn about different resorts. You might check out other Colorado Gems (coloradoski.com/gem-card) to find small, family-friendly resorts across Colorado. To look for resorts with great deals, try Liftopia.com. \n \nWhich muscles does skiing use? Downhill skiing mostly engages your quads and gluteal muscles. However, I can tell you that after a long day of skiing, your quads, calves, and even arms may be sore. \n \nYour arm muscles get used more than you might think when you\u2019re skiing. If you have to push with your poles down a long cat track (think: heading to Tenderfoot at Powderhorn) you\u2019ll use arm strength to help with that. If you fall and have to push yourself up, you\u2019ll again be using arm muscles to assist you. Mostly though, your quads are getting the biggest workout. If you want to start training for ski season in the fall, try squats, lunges, and cycling. \n \nWhich is safer, snowboarding or skiing? Either can be dangerous if you aren\u2019t in control and aren\u2019t paying attention to your surroundings. Ski or board at a speed at which you feel comfortable; don\u2019t let friends talk you into going faster than you want. Make sure you\u2019re on terrain that is suited to your abilities. Don\u2019t go down an expert run if you just took up the sport last week. Be aware of who and what is around you (trees, other skiers or boarders) and always wear a helmet.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Julie NormanSaturday, January"},"topics":[],"title":"Downhill discussion","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Montrose","zipCode":"81401","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Montrose","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683150","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1618"},"name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gjsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194733049","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:47:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Rigsby scored a game-high 21 points as the Wildcats set a school record for fewest points allowed in a game. \n  \n \nBy Dale Shrull \nSaturday, January 28, 2017 \n \nTrey Morrill made it tough on Montrose when he was at the top of Fruita Monument\u2019s suffocating 1-3-1 zone defense. \n \nAt 6-foot-6, the lanky, long-armed Morrill took away passing lanes and harassed Montrose ball-handlers beyond the top of the key. Then, to start the fourth quarter, Morrill snagged a steal near midcourt and took off, the crowd roaring in anticipation. \n \nMorrill didn\u2019t disappoint as the senior soared in high above the rim for a powerful dunk to put the Wildcats up 40-9. \n \nFruita Monument (9-9, 2-1) used that swarming defense throughout to come away with a 47-13 Southwestern League win over Montrose on Saturday. \n \n\u201cWe just want to create a lot of havoc up there,\u201d Morrill said about the zone defense. \u201cWe want to create steals and get layups and dunks. Our best defense is our greatest offense, and we have a great defense.\u201d \n \nOffensively, the Wildcats started quick with a three-point play from Gunner Rigsby and a 3-pointer from Jake Brizzolara for an 8-0 lead. \n \nThe 5-foot-10 Rigsby, who finished with a game-high 21 points, slipped a dunk over the rim later in the first quarter, and followed that with a highlight-reel underhand scoop for a bucket to put the Wildcats up 20-2. \n \nBut it was the Wildcats\u2019 defense that was the real star of the game. The 13 points allowed was a school record for Fruita Monument, breaking the old mark of 16. \n \n\u201cWe just kept working and working on defense, and the rim just kept getting tighter and tighter for them,\u201d Fruita coach Billy Dreher said. \n \nMontrose (6-11, 0-3 SWL ), a team of underclassman, was no match for the Wildcats\u2019 size, experience and athleticism. \n \nMorrill finished with eight points and Brizzolara seven for the Wildcats. \n \nFruita Monument Fruita girls cruise past Indians \n \nAngelique Gall\u2019s solid all-around game led Fruita Monument to a 56-24 Southwestern League win over Montrose. \n \nIn the first quarter when the Wildcats took a 21-5 lead, Gall did a little everything. \n \nThe Wildcats (16-1, 3-0 SWL) pounded the ball inside to the junior, who scored the first 10 points of the game and 12 of her 16 points in the first quarter. \n \nGall also scored off an offensive rebound, blocked a shot and forced two steals in the opening quarter. \n \nRosa Lopez added a 3-pointer and the Wildcats were cruised toward another blowout win. \n \n\u201cThey had a smaller lineup and we knew we wanted to get the ball inside,\u201d Gall said. \u201cWe knew it was going to work with any of our post (players),\u201d \n \nAs usual, the Wildcats\u2019 swarming defense, including a half-court press, was key to the win. \n \nMontrose (11-6, 1-2 SWL) finally crashed in on Gall, who took a pass inside at the post, then kicked it out to a wide-open MacKenzie Wells on the wing who swished a 3-pointer. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s one of my favorite things to do, especially kicking it out to our guards,\u201d Gall said. \n \nCoach Michael Wells shuffled players in and out for the rest of the game, with reserves getting plenty of playing time. \n \nThe second quarter was choppy for the Wildcats until Amy Stagg drilled a 3-pointer. Then, with the clock winding down, Alexis Prall swished a 3-pointer at the buzzer to put give the Wildcats a 31-10 lead at halftime.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Dale ShrullSaturday, January"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"\u2018Cats break record with stifling D","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Montrose","zipCode":"81401","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Montrose","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683150","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1618"},"name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gjsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194733217","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:55:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Studio shot on black background. \n  \n \nBy Rachel Sauer \nSaturday, January 28, 2017 \n \nThere\u2019s a scene in the film \u201cHidden Figures\u201d in which Col. Jim Johnson (played by Mahershala Ali) expresses surprise to see a woman doing complex mathematics because it\u2019s \u201cso taxing.\u201d \n \nKatherine Johnson (played by Taraji P. Henson), the woman doing the math, replies with this: \u201cOn any given day, I analyze the binomial levels of air displacement, friction and velocity and compute over 10,000 calculations by cosine, square root and lately analytic geometry. By hand. There are 20 bright, highly capable Negro women in the west computing group, and we\u2019re proud to be doing our part for the country. So yes, they let women do some things at NASA, Mr. Johnson. And it\u2019s not because we wear skirts. It\u2019s because we wear glasses.\u201d \n \nThere are a lot of ways the film, nominated Tuesday for the Best Picture Academy Award, can be seen: as women overcoming the times and attendant social barriers; as black women overcoming even more barriers because of their race; and as the triumph of math. \n \nUsed by people who know what they\u2019re doing, math saves the day. \n \nIn \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d it helps the United States win the space race and beat the commies. In life, well, we\u2019d still be living in caves without it, assuming the human species wasn\u2019t dead from some plague that could\u2019ve only been defeated with a foundation of math. \n \nIt would be wrong to call this the Age of Math, because every age has been an age of math or else life as we know it wouldn\u2019t exist, but it seems that finally popular culture is recognizing that the people to celebrate in film and on TV are the ones who know their way around the trapezoidal rule. \n \nIn fact, it\u2019s an especially hopeful sign for math getting its rightful recognition that the female mathematicians in \u201cHidden Figures\u201d aren\u2019t basement-dwelling weirdos incapable of interacting with other humans, but normal, cool, brilliant women who really, really know calculus. \n \nThis is a step up, because how many times in film have the mathematically inclined been portrayed as the geeky, the unstable, the hopeless and the hygienically challenged? \n \nOK, yes, the gang on \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d are huge nerds, but they\u2019re hilarious and that\u2019s a top 10 show. \n \nMaybe Hollywood will continue to recognize that the mathematician on the team is just as valuable, and probably more so, than the beefcake with the gun. Heck, maybe the mathematician is the beefcake with the gun. \n \nMaybe this could be the beginning of everyone loving, or at least appreciating, math just a little bit more. \n \n\u201cMath puts the real world in numbers,\u201d explained Emad Shahnoushi, 17, a junior at Palisade High School and a student in one of teacher Ann Conaway\u2019s AP calculus classes. \n \nAt the end of a recent class, the 15 boys and 11 girls in attendance that day pondered what they love about math. \n \n\u201cBecause it makes sense.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt has a right answer.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt explains science.\u201d \n \n\u201cBecause it has rules and it\u2019s not arbitrary like every other subject,\u201d said Shaun Arhelger, 17, also a junior, and only half joking. \n \nThis was at the end of a lesson on the trapezoidal rule, which began with an exercise Conaway designed based on the Stephen King book \u201cThe Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\u201d: \u201cNine-year-old Trisha McFarland is Hopelessly lost in the woods, and the efforts of those looking for her have turned up nothing. The graph below shows the woods in which she is lost and measurements of the width of the woods (in miles) at regular intervals.\u201d \n \nThe students had to use the trapezoidal rule to approximate the area of the woods and the number of people it would take to scour the entire woods in a single day, based on one person being able to search 15 square miles per day (which Conaway acknowledged is extremely generous). \n \nLike she does occasionally, because that\u2019s how math is approached in the real world, Conaway allowed her students to pull their super-strength calculators from their backpacks, though she wants them also to be able to do the calculus on paper. \n \nUltimately, after a few hits and misses \u2014 \u201cWe make a lot of mistakes in math,\u201d Conaway said, \u201cand the learning comes in when you recognize the mistake and figure out how to fix it.\u201d \u2014 it was determined that the woods were 51,850 square miles and the search would require 3,457 people. \n \nSo, this one\u2019s for the people who ignominiously lump arithmetic and mathematics together, who sneer, \u201cWhen am I ever going to use calculus in the real world?\u201d \n \nYou might not, but here\u2019s hoping the search and rescue team does. \n \nAnd yes, granted, not everyone is good at math, just like not everyone is good at laying tile or fixing cars or doing public relations. Maybe even reading about that trapezoidal rule exercise made you itchy and uncomfortable. \n \nBut math \u2014 so foundational, so fundamental \u2014 has long borne the stigma of being \u201chard.\u201d Remember the talking Barbie debacle from the late \u201890s, when one of her programmed phrases was \u201cMath is hard!\u201d \n \nTee hee! If everyone thought that way, Barbie, then you\u2019d probably want to stop driving your convertible over any bridges or near any kind of man-made structure. \n \nConaway said while some students do psych themselves out about the difficulty of math before they attempt it, District 51\u2019s emphasis on Habits of Mind is encouraging students to at least be willing to try. \n \n\u201cThrough the integration of Growth Mindset and Habits of Mind into our classrooms, students are more and more willing to treat things that are difficult for them as a challenge and an opportunity,\u201d explained Josh King, a math teacher at Central High School. \u201cOur school has been emphasizing the importance of effort over skill to encourage students to learn from their mistakes. \n \n\u201cGrowth Mindset is an ideology that is based on the work of Dr. (Carol) Dweck and revolves around the idea that our brains are malleable. Depending on our approach to tasks, concepts, etc. we can either let our prior experience hold us back and use it as an excuse (fixed mindset), or we can look at tough situations as a chance to grow \u2014 \u2018I can\u2019t factor that trinomial YET\u2019 (growth mindset).\u201d \n \nPerhaps it\u2019s this mindset that will raise the number of undergraduate students pursuing math-intensive majors, which has not seen net growth over the past 30 years, according to the Mathematical Association of America (maa.org). We need students in math-intensive majors! There will be no smartphone innovations, no space stations, no efficient machines, no crowd control, no urban design without them! \n \nPlus, consider this: Start typing the name \u201cIsaac\u201d into the Google search bar. All it takes is \u201cIsa\u201d and Google suggests \u201cIsaac Newton.\u201d Talk about a legacy! Who doesn\u2019t want to be that famous? Or at least as cool as, say, Neil deGrasse Tyson or Elon Musk? Or as visionary (and rich) as Bill Gates? \n \nThere is art in math, and elegance. British author G.K. Chesterton opined, \u201cThe difference between the poet and the mathematician is that the poet tries to get his head into the heavens while the mathematician tries to get the heavens into his head.\u201d \n \nAnd in \u201cThe Housekeeper and the Professor,\u201d Yoko Ogawa wrote, \u201cSolving a problem for which you know there\u2019s an answer is like climbing a mountain with a guide, along a trail someone else has laid. In mathematics, the truth is somewhere out there in a place no one knows, beyond all the beaten paths. And it\u2019s not always at the top of the mountain. It might be in a crack on the smoothest cliff or somewhere deep in the valley.\u201d \n \nYes! Math! The ultimate adventure! The uncharted territories!

Fourth St. has moved into the old Harbert Lumber building at 240 North Ave. and is open for business. \n \nCustomers can make purchases using cash or check while the internet is being installed, said Capt. Steve Staneart , commanding officer of the Grand Junction corps. \n \nStaneart said an arrangement with the Harbert family allowed the move, which may be permanent. \n \n\u201cThe Harbert family has been on our board for generations, and they were very kind to us to allow us to go in there for something we could afford,\u201d he said. \n \nThe Salvation Army is leasing the space for a year, with an option to buy the building if it\u2019s a good fit. \n \nStaneart said the building has nearly double the space as the old thrift store, and includes a yard that will be useful since the organization just received a license to do after-school care for children. \n \nThe organization will keep the former store building and plans on repurposing it for after-school programs offering arts, education, character development and sports. \n \nThe Salvation Army also spruced up its Clifton store at 3227 I-70 Business Loop B, Staneart said. \n \nThe stores are open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Saturday. \n \nFor more information, call 242-7513 or visit grandjunction.salvationarmy.org. \n \n■ Customers of the building materials supply company ProBuild , 2773 Riverside Parkway, probably have noticed the new signage and new name of the operation, Builders FirstSource , as they whizzed by along the parkway. \n \nIt\u2019s not a new business \u2014 just the final step in an acquisition process that began in July 2015. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re just now getting the signs changed,\u201d an employee at the newly branded store said this week, adding that the store is the same as what people remember. \n \nAt the time it was announced that Builders FirstSource was acquiring ProBuild, officials said the combined company would help better focus on their four critical customer segments: production builders, custom builders, multifamily/commercial builders, and repair and remodel businesses. The leverage of being a part of a national network \u2014 Builders FirstSource had 430 locations, and served 74 of the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas across 40 states at the time of the deal \u2014 is presumably a perk of the combination. \n \nIf you\u2019re wondering, Wikipedia via the United States Census Bureau says Grand Junction is the 279th statistically most populous metro are in the country, \n \n■ One end-of-the-year list that escaped our clutches until now was the Forbes \u2019 Ranking of America\u2019s 100 Largest Banks, which included some notable local strength. \n \nGlacier Bancorp , parent to Bank of the San Juans , ranked high on the list, at number five. \n \nUS Bancorp, or US Bank, was listed at number 58, and Wells Fargo ranked number 66, both respectable finishes on the list, which ranks banks based on metrics related to growth, profitability, capital adequacy and asset quality, Forbes said. \n \nAll of the data Forbes relied on for the list is based on regulatory filings for the period ending Sept. 30, 2016. \n \nThe magazine\u2019s ranking of the 100 largest banks was borne out of the financial crisis of the late 2000s, when credit quality was cratering across the banking industry. \n \n■ \n \nDo you know about an area business opening, closing, moving or changing?

However, I think it is quite shameful for our local newspaper to give the education articles more precedence than the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, on Friday. I looked for an article on the inaugural proceedings in Friday\u2019s paper and found it almost on the bottom of the front page with a headline in much smaller type than the school news. I thought, OK, maybe they are waiting until Saturday when they will show a larger picture and include a more impressive article. But I was disappointed again this morning. Same spot, same size photo and a small article. Guess I should have been thankful it was on the front page and not on Page 9A, which had a large photo, a small photo and a big article on the protesters. \n \nWhile various elected officials have often had big crowds for town hall meetings, the Grand Junction Women\u2019s March crowd of thousands publicly venting multiple issue opinions to an elected official is unprecedented \u2014 and entirely worthy as a front page newspaper story. \n \nIt was wonderful to see the strong images of the Women\u2019s March last weekend in downtown Grand Junction. If I knew there was a planned march, I would have driven in from Montrose to join. Count me in next time. \n \nThank so much for your coverage of the Women\u2019s March. Not only did it happen here but all over the world. Perfect example of our First Amendment rights. \n \nI\u2019m a little confused. I did not vote for President Trump, but yet he is my president. I did not yell vulgarities, I did not burn a limousine, and I did not march in protest over an imagined loss of rights wearing a \u201c##### hat.\u201d That in itself seems ignorant and self-degrading and has put the women\u2019s movement back to square one. I don\u2019t see how meaningless violence and uninformed protests will bring our country back together. But those are the things The Sentinel chose to give top billing in last Sunday\u2019s paper. Somebody help me. \n \nThank you, Daily Sentinel, for your great coverage of our local Women\u2019s March. How wonderful to see so many folks, of all ages, gather and walk together to promote tolerance, peace, unity and respect. \n \nFront page photograph from anti-president march mentions Japanese internment camp with no mention that those U.S. citizens were locked up by a Democratic Party president. \n \nThanks to The Daily Sentinel for its in-depth reporting regarding the Women\u2019s March. I was there to witness the event from the sidelines, and am pleased to say the newspaper article simply reported the facts (not \u201calternative facts\u201d). During this time when the media is being heavily criticized, it is increasingly important to protect this independent source of information as guaranteed by our Constitution. \n \nMesa County Commissioner John Justman says \u201cMesa County voters are conservative\u201d and thinks that\u2019s the only thing that should guide whatever he does in office. But the huge anti-Trump protest last week showed Mesa County in 2017 is far from being monolithic in its political views. There are lots of liberal and progressive residents in Mesa County, and our views count as well. We are tired of local elected representatives completely ignoring our views, as Mr. Justman does. Commissioner Justman needs to start respecting and representing our views as well. \n \nA tax increase is the way to get projects financed. I would be happy to approve an increase for a rec center. We have event centers \u2014 the fairgrounds, Avalon, Two Rivers, Las Colonias Park, the Botanical Gardens, James M. Robb Colorado River State Parks. How many do we need? We need a rec center. \n \nWe have a hockey rink and an events center. What we need is a rec center. It is a great place for children, youth, adults and senior citizens. I will never vote for anything but a rec center. \n \nIf the \u201ccity fathers\u201d think a $62 million investment is a great idea, how about spending it on an activities center that every citizen could use and enjoy? \n \nTo the jerk who almost killed us last night, Jan. 20: We were coming home and ready to turn left at 32 Road and \u2028C 1/2. My husband put on the left turn signal, happened to look in the mirror and saw you coming on the left at a very excessive speed, running from a sheriff\u2019s car. A few more seconds and you would have T-boned us and we would probably be dead today. In the future, be a decent human being and face up to whatever you did wrong instead of running away and endangering innocent people. \n \nOh, my goodness, Steve Beauregard! You have outdone yourself with your \u201ctaking turns for the worse\u201d column! Every time I read it, I see something else that just makes me laugh out loud. You know the Grand Valley, you live here and enjoy the valley. Keep up the witty writing. We all need a good laugh now and then, eh? \n \nIt is unfortunate to read about the dog killing on Orchard Mesa, but not a surprise, assuming the dog owner and Mesa County Animal Services had been made aware of the problem. It is unfortunate people being disturbed by a nuisance dog have to take the law into their own hands. A no-win situation for both parties. \n \nIf you call Xcel and give them the location of the burned out streetlight they will replace it. The one on the corner of Pitkin and Fifth strobes at night, which is dangerous for epileptics.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"StaffSaturday, January"},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"You Said It, Jan. 29, 2017","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Montrose","zipCode":"81401","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Montrose","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683150","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1618"},"name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gjsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194733913","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The cost of attending CMU ranges from roughly $18,900-$35,000, depending on residency, according to the univeristy\u2019s website. \n \nStudent-athletes receive athletic scholarships, but few, if any, of the coaches at CMU can afford a full international scholarship. \n \nAll international students who have an incoming grade-point average of 3.0 or higher can qualify for an $8,000 financial scholarship, $4,000 per semester. \n \n\u201cSadaam (Yousufzai), he\u2019s incredibly, incredibly bright and he wouldn\u2019t be here unless we could kind of package that together,\u201d men\u2019s soccer coach Todd Padgett said of the freshman from Afghanistan, who went to an American high school in Ontario, Canada. \n \n\u201cIt helps us tremendously. That\u2019s $8,000 we don\u2019t have to come up with, it\u2019s something they\u2019ve earned and the university awards them. Now that $28,000 figure is brought down to $20,000. \n \n\u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at an international player, the importance of that player qualifying for that amount of money is almost vital because of where our budget is at and what we have the ability to provide an international player is just simply not $30,000. But we can get the conversation started if you\u2019re able to knock that down to 20. Let\u2019s say out of pocket in your mind is another 10, now suddenly we\u2019re taking about $10,000 as opposed to $30,000.\u201d \n \nProof of funds isn\u2019t the only step in gaining admission, and working on international student-athlete eligibility can be a long, drawn-out process. \n \n\u201cThe most difficult thing I\u2019ve run into with international students is from the transcripts and test scores, and having either one, the original documents, two, a translation, or three, both,\u201d said Austin Kaiser, CMU\u2019s assistant athletic director for compliance and student services. \u201cThey have certain eligibility requirements and submissions into the (NCAA) eligibility center, that I can see, and that determines if they\u2019re eligible that first year or not. \n \n\u201cFortunately, the NCAA does take care of a lot of that, but they have certain requirements for what we have to submit. The challenge comes when a kid comes over from southwest Asia or Europe and they submitted originals to the institution, but that\u2019s all we have. \n \n\u201cOr we have a copy the institution can verify that yes, this is official, but the NCAA asks, we need an official copy, and if you don\u2019t have that, we need a certified, stamped copy of your transcripts, with a certified translation of your transcripts, and that has to be mailed in. There are certain criteria for what they need. It\u2019s difficult.\u201d \n \nKaiser has an NCAA website bookmarked on his computer that breaks down what\u2019s required. \n \n\u201cYou feel for the student-athletes, they don\u2019t necessarily know what\u2019s needed,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the education process, but until they\u2019re here, it\u2019s hard to educate them on that. All of a sudden the clock starts ticking on when to get it all in.\u201d \n \nAt CMU, Kaiser and the coaches rely on the admissions department and Annie Gingerich, who handles all international student admissions. Kaiser laughs that when an international student-athlete has a question about his or her status, the first words out of his mouth are often \u201cGo see Annie.\u201d \n \n\u201cShe\u2019s phenomenal,\u201d he said. \n \nAlong with eligibility and compliance, Kaiser\u2019s duties include student services, whether that\u2019s arranging tutoring, counseling or just being a sounding board for all athletes. \n \n\u201cI have 700 children, so I can\u2019t be the counselor for every single one of them. Something that I do best as I can is refer to the great resources we have on this campus,\u201d Kaiser said. \n \n\u201cIt all starts with them oftentimes coming into my office and sitting down and kind of having a heart-to-heart conversation, this is what I need. I\u2019d be lying if I said it\u2019s every single one of them every single day. It\u2019s pretty rare, but nonetheless that\u2019s where it starts. \n \n\u201cThey can come in here and shut the door and say whatever needs to be said. From there, I can say I think it is in your best interest to see this person. I\u2019ll help set up appointments, make phone calls, referrals, whatever it is.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Patti ArnoldSaturday, January"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: athletics news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Attending Mesa not cheap for foreign athletes","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Montrose","zipCode":"81401","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Montrose","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683150","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1618"},"name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gjsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194734255","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:48:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She moved to Grand Junction from Nepal when she was 12 years old. \n \n\u201cMy dad really wanted us to be able to succeed, and that\u2019s one of the main reasons he came to the U.S.,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery day I\u2019m so grateful for my dad and what he\u2019s done.\u201d \n \nAdhikari said it was hard adjusting to the language and culture for the first three years she lived in the United States. \n \n\u201cI have struggled and I do struggle, but through all of those struggles and adversity I\u2019m still very, very grateful,\u201d she said. \n \nShahnoushi said his father was separated from his family for long periods of time in his efforts to move from Iran to the United States, first for multiple failed attempts to get a visa from the American embassy in Turkey, and later in moving to Hong Kong for two years to obtain a visa there. \n \n\u201cWe went through a lot of hardships to get here,\u201d he said. \u201c(My father) is the reason I\u2019m here today and the reason I\u2019m able to have these opportunities.\u201d \n \nTalbott said he doesn\u2019t often experience discrimination within his orchards and farms. \n \n\u201cWe are dependent on a quality of worker that we can\u2019t get indigenously,\u201d he said. \n \nBut when his workers seek employment other places in the Grand Valley, racial discrimination is a factor. \n \nThere were a few moments of visible frustration, and one audience member vocally disavowed President Donald Trump\u2019s recent ban on refugees and travelers from several predominantly Muslim countries, including Syria. \n \nBut overall, attendants and speakers spoke of the need for unity. \n \n\u201cIt takes each and every one of us to do it, and it takes a lot of hard work,\u201d Norris said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Katie LangfordSaturday, January"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Nepal news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Community shares views on immigration","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Montrose","zipCode":"81401","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Montrose","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683150","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1618"},"name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gjsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194734605","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:03:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The case remains ongoing. \n \nIn Beauford\u2019s case, attorney David Lane wrote: \u201cA common thread in (several civil suits against the company) \u2026 is that CCS and related companies ignored obvious signs and symptoms to deny inmates access to necessary emergent care.

The Aussies think it's great because it's a win win for them.\" \n \nCahill said there was little compassion in the Australian policy, which sent back everyone no matter what their offence. \n \n\"It might be one thing when you've got someone that has committed an armed robbery sitting in jail. It's different when you've got someone who has lived their whole life there and been convicted of a relatively minor offence.\" \n \nTony Touri, 48, landed in Christchurch before Christmas, after stints in jail and an Australian immigration detention centre. \n \nHe left behind his family, a $2000-a-week job and the kickboxing club where he helped train youth. \n \nTouri saw Christchurch as a fresh start with labouring opportunities and a place free from old North Island gang connections. \n \n\"It turned my life upside down. When I arrived here, I felt like an alien.\" \n \nCahill said it had been well proven through released prisoners, that if supports were not in place, the risk of reoffending was greater. \n \n\"These people are sort of similar but there isn't the same support available to follow up with them all the time, so it doesn't surprise me we're getting that 30 per cent reoffending,\" he said. \n \nThe Canterbury branch of Pars has found growing demand for their support service. \n \n\"We could have one in a month. We could get roughly one a week, then two in one week,\" Murphy said. \n \nIn 2014, Pars settled just three people in Christchurch. That figure rose to 15 in 2015 and to 51 in 2016. \n \nFive women were among the group that had arrived since 2014. \n \nCounties Manukau District has the highest population of deportees, with 118 residing in the area.  \n \nAuckland City has attracted 89, while 69 people are listed in Canterbury.  \n \nWellington has 52 returning offenders and 51 are in the Waitemata District. \n \nCorrections deputy national commissioner Rachel Leota\u200b said the provision of effective reintegration services for returning offenders was important because many did not have strong links to New Zealand.  \n \nCorrections budgeted $300,000 a year for five years for providers such as Pars to help returning offenders settle back into life in New Zealand.  \n \nPrior to entering a contract with the Corrections in 2016, Pars received $77,000 from the Christchurch City Council to support deportees. \n \nCahill said before an information sharing agreement with Australian authorities was signed in September 2015, police were lucky to get a few hours notice of new arrivals.  \n \n\"Whereas now we are able to prepare a little and have staff meet them.\" \n \nHigh-risk offenders are visited by police 48 hours after arrival. \n \n\"It's good in theory but there simply aren't the resources to do that.

The Aussies think it's great because it's a win win for them.\" \n\nCahill said there was little compassion in the Australian policy, which sent back everyone no matter what their offence. \n\n\"It might be one thing when you've got someone that has committed an armed robbery sitting in jail. It's different when you've got someone who has lived their whole life there and been convicted of a relatively minor offence.\" \n\nTony Touri, 48, landed in Christchurch before Christmas, after stints in jail and an Australian immigration detention centre. \n\nHe left behind his family, a $2000-a-week job and the kickboxing club where he helped train youth. \n\nTouri saw Christchurch as a fresh start with labouring opportunities and a place free from old North Island gang connections. \n\n\"It turned my life upside down. When I arrived here, I felt like an alien.\" \n\nCahill said it had been well proven through released prisoners, that if supports were not in place, the risk of reoffending was greater. Ad Feedback \"These people are sort of similar but there isn't the same support available to follow up with them all the time, so it doesn't surprise me we're getting that 30 per cent reoffending,\" he said. \n\nThe Canterbury branch of Pars has found growing demand for their support service. \n\n\"We could have one in a month. We could get roughly one a week, then two in one week,\" Murphy said. \n\nIn 2014, Pars settled just three people in Christchurch. That figure rose to 15 in 2015 and to 51 in 2016. \n\nFive women were among the group that had arrived since 2014. \n\nCounties Manukau District has the highest population of deportees, with 118 residing in the area. \n\nAuckland City has attracted 89, while 69 people are listed in Canterbury. \n\nWellington has 52 returning offenders and 51 are in the Waitemata District. \n\nCorrections deputy national commissioner Rachel Leota\u200b said the provision of effective reintegration services for returning offenders was important because many did not have strong links to New Zealand. \n\nCorrections budgeted $300,000 a year for five years for providers such as Pars to help returning offenders settle back into life in New Zealand. \n\nPrior to entering a contract with the Corrections in 2016, Pars received $77,000 from the Christchurch City Council to support deportees. \n\nCahill said before an information sharing agreement with Australian authorities was signed in September 2015, police were lucky to get a few hours notice of new arrivals. \n\n\"Whereas now we are able to prepare a little and have staff meet them.\" \n\nHigh-risk offenders are visited by police 48 hours after arrival. \n\n\"It's good in theory but there simply aren't the resources to do that. And there are no controls,\" Cahill said. \n\nHe said in some cases in Auckland, returning offenders had checked out of supported living arrangements or motels before police arrived for their checkup. \n\n\"They're not breaking the law per se when they do that, because a lot of them aren't under any restrictions.

I want to change the often-held belief about township life.\u201d \n \nHis blog, aptly called Kasifixation, started two years ago and mainly centres on small entrepreneurs operating from street corners in the townships. \n \nKasifixation, a clever combination of the word kasi (slang for township) and fixation (passionate about something), has gained huge mileage on social media, and is opening business opportunities for those featured in the form of sponsorship and funding. \n \nMelwa, who says he is a social entrepreneur, said: \u201cI am very passionate about the township economy, and I believe this is one of the solutions to boost this sector. \n \n\"Most of the businesses I have featured on my blog have since increased their revenues because of the exposure. \n \n\u201cThere is a lot of business potential in the townships, [but it needs] to be tapped to the maximum. \n \n\"For example, the creative arts is a huge sector which, if tapped into, and supported by government, will create many jobs and improve the lives of township people and remove that stigma of townships being thought of as places of crime.\u201d \n \nHe said the creative arts sector could also bring tourists to townships and boost their economy, adding that shebeens are the prevalent business. \n \n\u201cBy my small contribution through my blog, I want to grow the small business which, in turn, will boost the township economy,\u201d he said. \n \nHis next big idea is to set up a \u201ccreative agency\u201d that will help township entrepreneurs market themselves and their products to ensure growth. \n \nMelwa also intends starting Kasi Bioscope \u2013 a pop-up cinema project which will be found in all the townships of Nelson Mandela Bay metro \u201cjust to introduce people to consuming creative art\u201d. \n \n\u201cI like township people to celebrate themselves, like their blackness, within the context of township life,\u201d he says. \n \nTwo of the businesses that have increased their bank balances because of the exposure from Kasifixation are 469 Enterprises, now a holding company of five businesses, and Bambanani Fresh Art, a leather products manufacturing company. \n \nSiyabulela Mandla, the owner of 469, told City Press this week that ever since appearing on Kasifixation, he has featured on national radio and in newspapers and magazines. \n \n\u201cI have other businesses under 469 and these are in the transport, car wash, shisa nyama sectors. My annual turnover has increased substantially, from R800 000 in 2013 to R2.3 million in 2015. \n \n\"So, that first exposure from the blog opened up some doors for me,\u201d he said. \n \nMandla employs 20 people. \n \nHe says that he was interested in business from childhood. \n \n\u201cI always wanted to know how the business industry works ... I used to make and sell wire cars at street corners in Motherwell where I grew up,\u201d he says. \n \nLast year he won the Eastern Cape SAB KickStart competition. \n \nMandla has also started a programme called Kasi Talks Business, where, along with other entrepreneurs, he teaches and trains employees business skills \u2013 from financial management to full entrepreneurship development. \n \nMandla says the euphoria of independence made people forget about the township economy and the import of starting small. \n \nPeople, he explains, thought that after independence they would get everything on a silver platter, earn large amounts of money and start big businesses. \n \n\u201cIt is only after 22 years that they have now realised that the dream will not materialise and are now thinking of spaza shops and other small township businesses,\u201d he says. \n \nMasibulele Matshaya, the owner of Bambanani Fresh Art, also attributes his growth to the blog. \n \n\u201cWe are now in talks with the department of trade and industry with a view to getting a sponsorship. After reading about us in the blog, the department contacted us asking for our profile, but we are still waiting,\u201d he said. \n \nThe company makes leather shoes and accessories such as belts, bags and wallets. \n \nIt employs three people, but hopes to increase the figure in the near future. \n \nTheir annual turnover as per last year was R48 000. \n \n\u201cThe problem is that there are no support systems in the township economy. The potential is massive. Government must assist this sector,\u201d he said, adding that they make 30 pairs of shoes a month. \n \nHe says they receive financial support from the Small Enterprise Development Agency, the Eastern Cape Development Corporation and the National Youth Development Agency. \n Read  Fin24's top stories  trending on Twitter:  Fin24\u2019s top stories \nFollow Fin24 on Twitter , Facebook , Google+ and Pinterest . 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24 .

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2650","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Wagga Wagga","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southern Weekly","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169750061","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Southern Weekly","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.southernweekly.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194738643","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Various members of staff and students work in the office. \n\nUdesmo chairperson Zukisa Fuzani echoed Nyati\u2019s sentiments, saying the structure would leave thousands unrepresented. \n\n\u201cThe way that this structure will be put in place is not democratic; students are not being afforded the chance to elect their own representatives. \n\n\u201cNot everyone will be afforded the chance to express their views in the SRC, for example the international office will not be represented,\u201d Fuzani said. Mbabela disagreed. She said: \u201cThe structure is made up of leaders of existing, recognised student formations. \n\n\u201cThey were elected to those positions by students and are therefore in a position to effectively represent them.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Siyamtanda Capa"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"\u2018New body will kill student politics\u2019","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Herald Live","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"458677779","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"name":"Herald Live","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldlive.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194739137","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:09:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I liked the NBA, college.\u201d \n \nSaldh attended a boarding school the past three years that was a few hours from his family. It helped him learn how to be on his own, but still, flying nearly 5,000 miles from home was hard. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s different from what I\u2019m used to,\u201d he said of college basketball. \u201cBut no regrets.\u201d \n \nOther than the food, perhaps. \n \n\u201cI think we have healthier food in Sweden,\u201d he said. \n \nAdjusting to an American diet is often an issue. \n \n\u201cI would love to have a home-cooked meal,\u201d said Chiara Giesselbach, a freshman on the CMU women\u2019s basketball team from Weiterstadt, Germany. \u201cMy mom used to make this potatoes with cheese and vegetables in the oven. I don\u2019t know how she makes it, but I miss it a lot.\u201d \n \nGiesselbach\u2019s older sister plays college basketball in San Diego, so she understood what she might encounter, but she and teammate Maja Beier, who is from Berlin, lean on each other. \n \n\u201cI feel like especially it was good to have each other around all the time,\u201d Giesselbach said. \n \n\u201cWhen I first came here, I\u2019ve never lived on a campus or (eaten) in a cafeteria,\u201d Beier said. \u201cI was always home with my parents. I\u2019m getting used to it.\u201d \n \nMost of the international student-athletes could take advantage of the long break at the holidays and go home. The international basketball players and their teammates had only one week off. Some, including Saldh and Beier, headed home, others, like Giesselbach, stayed in the U.S. \n \nAn advantage international student-athletes have over non-athletes from other countries studying at CMU is having a built-in group of friends on their team. \n \n\u201cThat first year is the toughest one,\u201d women\u2019s basketball coach Taylor Wagner said. \u201cAfter that they get to know people and have friends and integrate themselves on campus and in the community. \n \n\u201cThat first year they\u2019re still learning everything. It\u2019s hard for someone from the U.S., let alone leaving home and what you\u2019re used to.\u201d \n \nAfter the first semester, even though they still miss their families, the homesickness isn\u2019t as bad. Skype or FaceTime allow them to video chat with their families, which helps. Like every other student-athlete, they have to learn to manage their time with practice, games and classes. \n \nIn Germany, you either play basketball in a club program, or go to university, Beier said, not both at the same place. Being able to go to college and play basketball, the 6-foot-4 center said, is \u201ccool.\u201d \n \nOne of the international student-athletes in the basketball program, Filip Nowicki, has been through what the freshmen are feeling. He\u2019s been in the U.S. five years, first attending a prep school in Indiana, then going to Sacred Heart before deciding to transfer after two years. \n \n\u201cAfter coming to the States, the biggest challenge was the language,\u201d said Nowicki, from Wloclawek, Poland. \u201cI wasn\u2019t homesick because I left home when I was 13. I got used to being away from my family, I went to school five hours away. Being away from family wasn\u2019t a big deal for me, but the language and basketball was different.\u201d \n \nMost of the international student-athletes have had English classes since they were young, but Nowicki said he still struggled when he first came to America. Last week he met an American student on his floor who speaks some Polish, which was a nice surprise. \n \n\u201cI came with practically no English,\u201d he said. \u201cWe took English in high school, but I would say no English. I had to learn everything, how to talk, speak and read it.\u201d \n \nBeier, too, said she was worried at first about the language, and although sometimes her grammar isn\u2019t perfect in her papers, she\u2019s doing well in class. \n \n\u201cBefore I came here I thought it would be really hard with the language. In school I would have problems understanding or writing an essay,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of the teachers know I\u2019m an international student, I told them at the beginning. When they grade my essays they know I\u2019m an international student, so maybe that helps.\u201d \n \nInternational clubs have meetings and have activities such as going on hikes that Beier said helps them meet more people who are sharing the same experiences. \n \nSometimes it just takes a little time to become acclimated, like any college student. \n \n\u201cFrederikke (Karst) is doing better this year,\u201d tennis coach Dan MacDonald said of the sophomore from Denmark. \u201cShe and (Rebecca Osterburg, who is from Sweden) are friends, and sometimes that happens, you get one and they reach out to a friend and they come. (Karst) struggled a little bit with the language and the food we eat, little things like that. This year she seems more at ease.\u201d \n \nAnd there are bonuses. \n \n\u201cFrederikke loves how cheap our clothes are here,\u201d MacDonald said, laughing. \u201cShe\u2019s a shopper. Electronics, phones, everything here is so much cheaper. When her family comes, \u2018We\u2019re going to go over to the outlets in Dillon, everything\u2019s so cheap in your country!\u2019 \u201c \n \nDespite the obstacles they face in language, food and distance from home, there\u2019s also a comfort zone. \n \n\u201cThe sports part puts them at ease,\u201d MacDonald said. \u201cIt gives them a place they\u2019re used to.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Patti ArnoldSaturday, January"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Mexico news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: athletics news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"College education, athletics a draw for Colorado Mesa international student-athletes","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Montrose","zipCode":"81401","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Montrose","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683150","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1618"},"name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gjsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194739581","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:48:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

His family is suing the county for not properly caring for Beauford\u2019s epilepsy, which killed him while an inmate at the jail. Photo special to the Sentinel \n  \n   \nTomas Beauford and his mother, Tiffany Marsh. Photo special to the Sentinel. \n  \n   \nOne of the men\u2019s pods in the Mesa County Jail. \n  \n  \nBy Gabrielle Porter \nSaturday, January 28, 2017 \n \nA bracelet might have kept Tomas Anderson Beauford alive. \n \nDespite mental and behavioral illnesses that meant the 24-year-old functioned more like a 6-year-old, Beauford had mastered the use of the magnetic bracelet that combatted his epilepsy. \n \nBut on April 16, 2014, Beauford didn\u2019t have his bracelet. It had been confiscated by deputies at the Mesa County Jail. \n \nTaking his prescribed medications also might have kept Beauford alive. But in jail without family and caretakers who often cajoled him with promises of Starbursts and Sprite, Beauford hadn\u2019t taken his meds regularly in six weeks when he died. \n \nIn the hours before his death, Beauford\u2019s jailers saw him suffering what they would later realize were several violent seizures in his cell. Attorneys representing Beauford\u2019s mother wrote that if deputies had reacted correctly, he might never have died. \n \n\u201cAlone in his cell, Mr. Beauford ultimately had a series of seizures, fell off his bed and died with his head jammed underneath his desk,\u201d the attorneys wrote in a civil lawsuit naming Mesa County and the jail health care providers as defendants last spring. \u201cMr. Beauford\u2019s demise could have undoubtedly been prevented had defendants provided him with prompt and appropriate medical attention and treatment.\u201d \n \nAn autopsy determined Beauford\u2019s death was natural and caused by a seizure. Jail workers who dealt with him were cleared of wrongdoing after an internal investigation that\u2019s referenced in the civil suit, but which the county refused to release, saying it was subject to the \u201cgovernmental deliberative process privilege,\u201d according to Assistant County Attorney John Rhoads. Mesa County sheriff\u2019s spokeswoman Megan Terlecky wouldn\u2019t answer questions about whether any jail policies have changed in the years since Beauford\u2019s death, citing the ongoing lawsuit. \n \nCorrect Care Solutions, the Tennessee-based company that employed the jail\u2019s nursing staff, still holds the contract to provide health care in the jail. Mesa County commissioners are expected to vote on that contract soon. \n \nBeauford\u2019s mother, Tiffany Marsh of Aurora, said her son\u2019s death is evidence that jail guards and nursing staff aren\u2019t properly trained on handling mental illness. \n \n\u201cDo they not understand what disability means? Do they not understand?\u201d Marsh said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a mentally ill kid who needed help, not to die in jail.\u201d \n \nSTRUGGLED AS YOUTH \n \nBeauford\u2019s challenges in life started early. \n \nMarsh, then a teenage mother, said she was in denial about the issues her family and friends saw in her newborn son. \n \nBeauford was diagnosed early on with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder at school. But a doctor later said when teachers thought his attention was drifting, Tomas had probably been suffering from multiple small-scale seizures. \n \nBeauford\u2019s emotional and behavioral issues worsened during the next several years. Hallucinations began at age 8 after he was injured by a falling windowpane. \n \nHe was 12 when he had his first grand mal seizure. He was later diagnosed with epilepsy, a condition that never subsided. \n \nDespite Beauford\u2019s health problems, Marsh said he was fun-loving and kind. Generous to a fault, he held a job as a groundskeeper at the Aurora Mental Health Center, but often gave his pay away. When he was little, he liked to invent board games that he made his family play. \n \n\u201cThat boy wasn\u2019t just loved,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cHe was adored, and he was cherished.\u201d \n \nMarsh\u2019s goal was always to keep Beauford at home. But the single mother of four had an increasingly hard time keeping track of him. At 17, he went missing for 10 days. Marsh found him at an adult care facility; he was taken there when he couldn\u2019t remember who he was. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s when his memory started going,\u201d Marsh said. \n \nBeauford eventually was placed in a psychiatric hospital at Fort Logan, where he was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Later he was sent to another facility in Pueblo, where doctors realized how badly he had deteriorated since his epilepsy diagnosis. \n \n\u201cThey finally did the IQ test and realized he had lost 20 points on the IQ test,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching a person with Alzheimer\u2019s, except he was younger.\u201d \n \nBeauford\u2019s condition briefly improved after doctors changed his medications, but he eventually started to decline again and his seizures became more violent. \n \nWhen he was about 19, Marsh, initially resistant to brain surgery, eventually agreed that he should receive an implant to help assuage his seizures. The implant \u2014 a \u201cvagal nerve stimulator\u201d \u2014 cycled on and off throughout the day. He was fitted with a magnetic bracelet and taught to hold the magnet near his body when he felt a seizure coming. The device wouldn\u2019t necessarily stop seizures, but it would prevent them from snowballing into dangerous back-to-back episodes, Marsh said. \n \nBeauford, a young adult whose mental state was still in decline, spent a year living at Wheat Ridge Regional Center west of Denver in 2012. It was convenient for Marsh, but eventually Beauford started to wander again. \n \nOnce, caretakers called to tell Marsh her son had wandered away and was found having a seizure on the railroad tracks. Staffers didn\u2019t think it was safe for him to stay in Wheat Ridge and suggested he transfer to the Grand Junction Regional Center, which was able to lock down residents for security. \n \nMarsh, who looked forward to a date with her son every Thursday \u2014 shopping, movies and other outings with just the two of them \u2014 reluctantly agreed. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t want him to go to Grand Junction because it\u2019s so far from me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t want him to die either.\u201d \n \nARRESTED FOR VIOLENT BEHAVIOR \n \nBeauford\u2019s time on the Western Slope, far from his family, didn\u2019t go smoothly. He was arrested Nov. 30 after staff at the Grand Junction Regional Center reported that he was breaking facility windows by throwing chairs against them, an affidavit said. Beauford\u2019s magnetic bracelet was confiscated when he was booked at the Mesa County Jail, despite a document from the Regional Center describing the implant, the civil suit said. \n \nBeauford suffered more than one seizure during a weekend in the jail holding cell. The lawsuit suggested jail staff unsuccessfully tried to get Beauford to take his medication but never moved him from the cell. \n \nBeauford was released on bond Dec. 2 and Regional Center staff later told prosecutors not to press charges. \n \nBeauford was arrested again March 1. During this altercation, Beauford threw punches, kicks and a steel chair at other people, an affidavit for his arrest said. The report said Beauford had grabbed the buttocks of people trying to restrain him. \n \n\u201c(One victim) received no physical injuries but wanted to report the unwanted sexual contact by Tomas, who has a history of sexual assaults,\u201d the report said. Beauford was arrested on assault charges as well as a misdemeanor count of unlawful sexual contact. \n \nThis time Beauford wasn\u2019t released after a weekend. He was ordered held on a $10,000 cash or surety bond, and stayed in jail. \n \nMENTAL STATE DETERIORATED \n \nBeauford\u2019s condition was poor from the day he was arrested. \n \nJail records cited in the civil suit described him having \u201cmultiple seizures during the booking process.\u201d \n \nDespite the jail\u2019s past experience with Beauford and a document from the Grand Junction Regional Center describing in detail his medical needs, a deputy wrote on an intake form that Beauford had no special medical or mental health needs. \n \nHis magnetic bracelet was confiscated again and Beauford again stopped taking his meds. \n \nGrand Junction defense attorney JR Davis, who took over Beauford\u2019s case two weeks after his arrest, said the 24-year-old was incoherent the first time they met in court March 17. \n \nDavis also visited Beauford in jail March 27 for 45 minutes. \n \n\u201cI tried to ask him questions about his case,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI tried to ask him questions about himself and he just maintained his downward gaze. He had spit coming out of his mouth.\u201d \n \nDavis, who filed a motion for a court-ordered mental competency evaluation the next day, said he doesn\u2019t believe anyone could have mistaken Beauford for a fully functioning adult. \n \nMarsh didn\u2019t visit her son at the jail until April 4. She noticed then that he wasn\u2019t wearing his magnetic bracelet. Beauford told her it had been taken. \n \nA staffer from the Regional Center had told Marsh earlier that two magnetic bracelets had been brought to the jail \u2014 one for Beauford and one usually worn by his caretaker. \n \nMarsh said a jail nurse she spoke to by phone after the visit assured her Beauford would get it back. \n \nAccording to the civil filing, though, he never did. \n \nDEATH PRECEDED BY MULTIPLE SEIZURES \n \nBeauford\u2019s medical condition \u201crapidly deteriorated\u201d in the hours before his death April 16, 2014, the suit said. The filing described multiple instances when jail staff and nurses noted seeing Beauford having a seizure and didn\u2019t provide medication or transport him. One deputy is described seeing Beauford having a seizure on his bed and neither opening his cell door nor contacting him through the intercom. \n \n\u201cRather than providing him with the medical attention and treatment he so desperately needed, Mr. Beauford was actively ignored,\u201d the complaint said. \n \nA deputy spotted Beauford lying on the ground in his cell with his head inside the bottom shelf of his desk at about 11:55 p.m. April 15. \n \n\u201c(The deputy) elected not to enter Mr. Beauford\u2019s cell to check on him, knock on Mr. Beauford\u2019s door, or to utilize the intercom to check on him, even though he knew that Mr. Beauford had suffered multiple seizures earlier in the night,\u201d the filing said. \n \nTwenty minutes later, the same deputy returned to Beauford\u2019s cell to check on him. When Beauford didn\u2019t move or respond to knocking or calls through the intercom, the guard asked for a nurse using a code that the filing describes as meaning \u201cthe situation to which they are being called is not urgent,\u201d the civil suit said. \n \nThe nurse immediately recognized that Beauford wasn\u2019t breathing and a deputy began CPR. The nurse attempted to use an automated external defibrillator on him, but Beauford was already dead. \n \nA case report filed by the Mesa County Sheriff\u2019s Office \u2014 which includes accounts from the nurse that night, Renee Workman, and two night shift deputies on duty when Beauford died, Peter Dalrymple and Richard Perkinson \u2014 confirms much of the detail from the civil suit. \n \nIt\u2019s notable that the magnetic bracelet, key to the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit, isn\u2019t mentioned once in the Sheriff\u2019s Office case report. \n \nDeputy Perkinson\u2019s account in the report is particularly significant. He recounts how at one point, while checking Beauford in his cell, he dismisses shaking and \u201cgrunting\u201d under a blanket by Beauford as \u201cmasturbation.\u201d \n \nAn investigator later in the report reminds, \u201cDeputy Perkinson confirmed he was aware of Mr. Beauford\u2019s seizures,\u201d as he was present when Beauford was first booked, and experiencing seizures during the process. \n \nSEEKING REFORMS \n \nMarsh said she has been trying to put her life back together since her son\u2019s death. She planned to speak Jan. 21 about her son at the Women\u2019s March on Washington. \n \nIn April 2016, Marsh filed a lawsuit naming as defendants Mesa County, former Mesa County Sheriff Stan Hilkey, Correct Care Solutions and a number of deputies and nurses who had contact with Beauford.

Nowicki, a junior, is from Poland. \n  \n   \nMoshe Perez, pointing after a goal \n  \n   \nEimer Lopez \n  \n   \nRoberto Diaz \n  \n  \nBy Patti Arnold \nSaturday, January 28, 2017 \n \nWhen the Colorado Mesa men\u2019s soccer team played in the 2014 NCAA Division II final four, the Mavericks had four international players on their 35-man roster. \n \nOne of those, Stan Schrock, is the son of U.S. military parents, who was born in Italy and grew up in Okinawa, Japan, where he honed his soccer skills. \n \nThe University of Charleston had 15 Americans on a 50-man roster. \n \n\u201cOne American saw the field for Charleston,\u201d coach Todd Padgett said. \n \nThe official boxscore showed all 15 Charleston players listed as participating in its 2-0 victory were internationals as opposed to two for CMU, Schrock and Roy Abergil. \n \nThat experience opened Padgett\u2019s eyes to the reality that, even in Division II athletics, international student-athletes are a major factor in success at the national level. \n \n\u201cI think one thing we were able to come back home and say was, well, I think we can sprinkle in a little bit of international flavor to what we\u2019re doing. I think we\u2019ve done that the past few years in the recruiting classes we\u2019ve brought in,\u201d Padgett said. \n \nThis past fall, the Mavericks had nine international players on the roster, two of whom were redshirts, another who attended high school in Denver. \n \nPadgett estimated that of the roughly 25 emails he and Schrock, now his assistant coach, get every day, 80 percent are from international student-athletes. \n \nIn many cases, international student-athletes are a bit older and more experienced than Americans straight out of high school or junior college. \n \n\u201cWe love them all the same, but (international athletes) come over here with greater experience and playing at a greater level,\u201d Padgett said. \u201cBy and large that generally equates to being a little more gifted, a little more talented, or at least a little more experienced. \n \n\u201cOne thing that made Roy so successful, he\u2019s 25 years old, he was experienced, he had simply played more soccer at a higher level than any other player in the program. We all saw that.\u201d \n \nAbergil graduated in December and is currently trying out for professional soccer teams in the U.S. \n \nEvery coach at CMU is inundated daily by emails from athletes, parents and recruiting services. More and more international students are reaching out, and more and more coaches are saying yes. \n \n\u201cIf they can play, I don\u2019t really care where they\u2019re from. If they\u2019re from Timbuktu, if they\u2019re a good student-athlete and a guy who can help us, he\u2019s a guy I want to recruit,\u201d said Michael Dominguez, the assistant men\u2019s basketball coach and recruiting coordinator. \n \nThe logistics of recruiting international student-athletes can get tricky. Limited recruiting budgets don\u2019t include coaches hopping on international flights, or paying for official on-campus visits from abroad. \n \nEmails are exchanged, followed by text messages and phone calls, and Skype and FaceTime come in handy for face-to-face conversations. CMU has a virtual tour of campus on its website so recruits can get a look at where they might be living the next 4-5 years, and once an offer is made, Annie Gingerich, the associate director of admissions who specializes in international programs and services, makes sure everything is in order. \n \nPassports and visas are a must, and there are a myriad of regulations regarding international student-athletes\u2019 age and past teams. Many countries don\u2019t have school sports like the United States, and club and national teams could violate the NCAA\u2019s amateurism guidelines. \n \nAbergil was docked one year of eligibility because he played several games for a team in Israel after serving his required two years in the military before coming to CMU. \n \nFilip Nowicki played for a professional club basketball team in Poland before entering the U.S. to attend prep school, but because he wasn\u2019t paid other than the allowed expenses and equipment, he retained his amateur status. \n \nAfter prep school, which helped him learn English, Nowicki said he had more than a dozen Division I scholarship offers. He went to Sacred Heart in Connecticut, but wasn\u2019t happy with a lack of playing time and decided to transfer after two years. \n \n\u201cCoach Dominguez found me and messaged me on Twitter,\u201d he said. \n \nOnce he was released from Sacred Heart, his name was placed on a website of players seeking to transfer. With the Mavericks needing big men, Dominguez noticed the\u20286-foot-10, 250-pound center, and started the process. \n \n\u201cThe hard part is you don\u2019t get to see them in person,\u201d Dominguez said of many international recruits. \u201cEvery other foreign kid we\u2019ve seen live, Fil we didn\u2019t get to see live, but he had a lot of film out there and Division I talent, you\u2019re able to understand it a little bit more.\u201d \n \nLudde Saldh, a freshman on the men\u2019s basketball team, wasn\u2019t seen in person \u2014 he\u2019s from Gothenburg, Sweden. Dominguez saw him on video and talked to his coaches, and was convinced the 6-8 forward could compete in Division II basketball. \n \nJames Sylvester (Canada) and Eimer Lopez (Puerto Rico) transferred to CMU. Dominguez saw Lopez at a junior college jamboree, and Sylvester had played for former CMU guard Jase Herl. \n \nIn total, Colorado Mesa has more than 30 international student-athletes on 14 different teams this school year. The majority made first contact, and, several coaches said, paved the way for others to look to the Mavericks. \n \nTennis coach Dan MacDonald has brothers Max and Oliver Lindqvist from Sweden, and women\u2019s basketball coach Taylor Wagner signed two players from Germany this season, guard Chiara Giesselbach and center Maja Beier, who were teammates on a tournament team that played in San Diego last summer. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a different avenue, where you might be recruiting against three or four other schools rather than if they\u2019re in the U.S., 20 or 30 other schools. Your odds increase a little bit,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThere are things you have to account for, are they going to get homesick? You don\u2019t get to see them a lot; a lot of times it\u2019s just video. I was lucky enough to see these two girls.\u201d \n \nBeier, Wagner said, probably would have had Division I schools beating down her door if she was from the U.S., because she\u2019s 6-4. \n \nLike soccer, tennis is a sport that has rosters packed with international players, even in the RMAC. And like Padgett, MacDonald said if you want to keep up with the competition, it\u2019s vital to have a diverse roster. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019re all great kids and they just want to play tennis,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re such an international sport, like soccer, obviously. Tennis is just so popular in Europe, South American countries and Australia. To be competitive, we have to have a couple. \n \n\u201cWould I like to have all American kids? Part of me says probably yes, but it\u2019s a great learning experience for the international kids and the American kids. They experience different cultures.\u201d \n \nObviously tennis, soccer, golf, basketball and track and field are wildly popular throughout the world, but American football? \n \nCMU coach Russ Martin said it\u2019s growing \u2014 he has two players from Panama, Riccardo Young and Jan Michael Mirrop, both of whom redshirted this season. They attended Parker Lutheran High School in Denver, a school the Mavericks typically recruit. \n \nYoung and Mirrop could pave the way for a coaching clinic, Martin said. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do a deal with them in Panama. One\u2019s dad heads all the youth leagues in Panama City, so he\u2019s trying to get a situation where our coaches can go down hopefully this summer and do a camp for their kids and a clinic for coaches, and in return, hopefully some of their coaches can come up here to mirror and follow us through spring football for four or five days and hopefully improve the level of teaching and coaching,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIf we can get it done I think it\u2019ll be an awesome deal.\u201d \n \nYoung, a defensive lineman, and Mirrop, a linebacker, are raw, but eager to learn. \n \n\u201cBoth are very raw, but they are good young men, great work ethic, and they are strong, so I think they have a chance to be good players,\u201d Martin said. \n \nWith less-restrictive age limits than Division I, more international athletes are looking to Division II schools, and more and more Division II schools are loading up rosters with older, international-experienced athletes. \n \nPadgett knows that international experience has helped the Mavericks compete at the national level \u2014 Abergil scored 23 of CMU\u2019s 42 goals this season \u2014 but he also believes that the university\u2019s first priority is American students. He\u2019ll continue to recruit internationally, but within reason. Abergil, Moshe Perez, Luis Schraidt and Roberto Diaz, he said, \u201cdid a fantastic job elevating our program.\u201d \n \n\u201cI think it\u2019s a bit unfortunate that Division II, especially on the soccer side of things because of how global our sport is, is really gravitating toward (international rosters). I think it\u2019s something we will always try to fight against, because we don\u2019t want Colorado Mesa\u2019s men\u2019s soccer program to be all international players,\u201d Padgett said. \n \n\u201cA lot of people probably wonder what we would look like without a Roy, without a Moshe. I don\u2019t have the answer to that question. I think they make us better. I still think we would be successful here at Mesa without those two, but as a staff, after we got back from the final four, we said, \u2018OK, we need a couple more special players.\u2019 \u2019\u2019","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Patti ArnoldSaturday, January"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"International flavor","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Montrose","zipCode":"81401","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Montrose","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683150","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1618"},"name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gjsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194740263","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:46:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

What do you have to say about that? \n  \nIgbo President is possible in 2019 but not through APC or PDP. APC will like President Buhari to continue for second term and PDP has zoned the presidency to the North. The only chance for the Igbo is to form a formidable political party together with other notable Nigerians which will present an Igbo man as their presidential candidate. \n \nWith hard work and good reason presented to other Nigerians, it will work. Nigerians are changing everyday by day with their thinking cap, and sure that ordinary Nigerians will not continue to support marginalisation. Obasanjo\u2019s support for the Igbos is highly welcomed but for now you can see that he is no more in power to make it happen, it is left for the Igbos to work hard towards that direction. Lastly, the better option for all Nigerians is for Buhari to implement the 2014 National Conference recommendations for equitable Nigeria. \n Some Igbo called for support for Gen Muhammadu Buhari (rtd) during his campaign and they said it was for the good of the Igbos. Do you think that the government of Buhari will benefit the Igbos?  \nI am aware that some individuals in the South East called for Igbo support for Buhari prior to the 2015 elections. There was even a blame game against the Igbos for putting their eggs in one basket. It is too early to judge Buhari or know his mindset on Igbos, however time will tell. President Jonathan lost the election and Igbos feel bad but we lost nothing because we gained the brotherhood of the South South. When Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu was alive, he visited the Alafin of Oyo and the Ooni of Ife to extend hand shake across the Niger. \n \nHis action was misunderstood, but he explained that if there was an understanding between the South East and South West, it was the beginning of political wisdom. He also explained that the personalities he went to visit in the West were the greater authorities he had to meet to forge a political understanding. However after the Igbos had tried in the First Republic and other periods in the political history of Nigeria, they had a change of mind. \n \nThe Igbos reasoned they had supported the North and the West in the past, and that partnership failed. The Igbos    even reasoned that since    Ojukwu\u2019s idea of a handshake across the Niger did not work, a new political partnership was necessary. More recently, the South South, South East and South West Assembly was formed aimed at securing    support from these zones for    Jonathan and also in case an Igbo man decides to contest the presidential election in future. \n \nMeetings were held in Enugu, Asaba and some other places. Ekwueme, Chief ABC Nwosu, Chief    Chukwuemeka Ezeife and a host of others attended some of the meetings. Also Ohanaeze Ndigbo\u2019s call for support for Goodluck Jonathan was done after wide consultations from traditional rulers and important personalities. However we will still enter into political understanding with the Middle Belt and the North after wide discussions. \n Calista Nkiru Adimachukwu \nWe will let everyone know the reasons while the South East will vie for president and expect wide support from other zones. Nevertheless, after we try all these things and they fail, the    solution lies in the implementation of the report of the 2014 National Confab. If there is any Igbo personality that is begging for recognition and position from the government of Buhari, that person is insulting the Igbos. What we expect from those people is for them to tell Gen. Mohammadu Buhari point blank to implement the reports of the National Constitutional Conference of 2014. \n \nYou have emphasized the report of the National Conference. Do you think it remains the solution to the agitations of the Igbos? \n \nBefore the National Conference, slots were given to political parties. However APC did not send representatives and they made no contributions. All the geo-political zones sent delegates and    appreciated that conference as well as saw its relevance. They finally came out with a masterpiece and powerful document on how Nigeria can live together peacefully. Till now, APC has said nothing about that constitutional conference and it remains suspicious. So if any person starts asking questions about the reasons the Igbos supported President Goodluck Jonathan, that person is not a student of history. Ndigbo supported Jonathan mainly because of that conference. Therefore any Igbo personality that meets Buhari should urge him to implement the report of the National Conference for equitable Nigeria. When the dust settles down, Ohanaeze Ndigbo will go and meet Buhari with a powerful delegation to discuss a way forward and also about the report of the National Conference. \n \nDo Igbos have any regret? \n \nYes, the Igbos have three regrets. The first is the non-implementation of the Aburi Accord. The second is that the Igbos have not gotten any meaningful gain after their foremost contributions to Nigeria\u2019s independence. The third regret is that the East and West delayed Nigeria\u2019s independence for the North to meet up with the pace of independence. It was because of this that Whitehall imposed federalism on Nigeria. Sadly, our sacrifice is not appreciated. \n \nWhat are Ohanaeze Ndigbo doing on this ongoing IPOB crisis. (Struggle for Biafra)? \n \nFirst of all, I would like to draw you back to my interview in Vanguard newspaper on may 24, 2015 with the headline \u201cIgbos case on National Conference report for Buhari\u201d \u2014 Ohanaeze National Women Leader. Our regrets as a region in Nigeria\u201d. \n \nI granted that interview before President Buhari was sworn in on may 29, 2015. My reason for granting that interview was for him to know the position of Ndigbo for equitable Union government. \n \nWhen he assumed office and started making appointments. He was supposed to treat all Nigerians fairly according to the oath of office he took, so when he started making lopsided appointments, sidetracking one of the major bloc that contributed more than any region in Nigeria to give Nigeria the fastest independence. That was what provoked the youths to agitate for Biafra, because they feel that they don\u2019t have any future in one Nigeria. I am again pleading to Mr President as a mother to immediately start the process of implementing the 2014 national conference report for equitable Nigeria, where everyone would have a sense of belonging without fear or favour. I also use this opportunity to plead with Mr President to grant Nnamdi Kanu unconditional release because he has done nothing to warrant his continuous incarceration. I am urging Vanguard newspaper to republish my may 24,2015 interview for Nigerian\u2019s perusal because it is still in tune with current reality. \n \nWhat do you think/comment on this Patience Jonathan\u2019s issue with EFCC? \n \nI am not against President Buhari\u2019s war against corruption through EFCC but first of all the war should be fought with sincerity in all ramifications. \n \nIf left to me to advise, the president should start the anti-corruption crusade from members of his party to prove to the world that he is sincere in what he is doing, not only fighting the opposition. In my own humble opinion it is a clear cut agenda to bulldoze the opposition. \n \nAs for Jonathan\u2019s wife, I am not against the EFCC probing her but they should beam their search lights to former first ladies from Northern Nigeria extraction to prove to the world that they are not just out to fight Jonathan\u2019s family who made sure that there was a peaceful transition to the present administration which was acclaimed world wide. \n \nWhat is your view on current recession under the watch of the APC leading government? \n \nWhen APC as a political party were campaigning to be voted into power, they knew very    well that Nigeria economy had a problem, so they came up with the change agenda, that if voted into power they would restore the economy, that was the reason Nigerians voted for them. \n \nWhen they assumed office they started blame game and that blame game has continued till today, pretending they didn\u2019t know there was a problem before they took office, instead of doing the needful of restoring the economy. Based on    that, foreign investors started pulling out their money back to their country and that is why we are in this present recession. But all hope is not lost because Nigeria have potentials to be great again even more than before within 10 years. \n \nI could remember that after the Nagasaki and Hiroshima    atomic bombing of second world War in Japan, they cut themselves out of the world for 20 years and looked inwardly on how to bounce back. Look at their economic position in the world affairs now. Nigeria\u2019s case is a matter of 10 years, that is why I am pleading to Mr President to do the needful so that we can have the \n \nconducive environment to move the Nigeria economy forward. \n \nYour take on Yoruba supporting secret trial for Nnamdi Kanu? \n \nThe Yoruba\u2019s are intelligent people. I do not think that it is the collective decision of the Yoruba\u2019s to back the secret trial of Nnamdi Kanu. So it is only the personal opinion of the individual saying it. \n \nWhat do you have to say concerning the capture of Sambisa forest by the Nigeria military? \n \nOur president Muhammadu Buhari should be congratulated for that. But the Federal Government has to do more to ensure that the Chibok girls are rescued and Shekau captured. \n \nOn Ibori\u2019s release from UK prison? \n \nWhat do you want me to say on that. The london court has released him, so he should enjoy his freedom. \n \n2017 FG budget as it concerns  Ndigbo? \n \nWe have our representatives in the Senate and House of Representatives. It is their duty to scrutinize the budget and highlight if it is favourable to us or not. If it is not favourable to Igbos, it is also their duty to find a remedy. That is one of the reasons we voted them there.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Igbo presidency: Don\u2019t rely on Obasanjo\u2019s support- Adima ...","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"LiveBip.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608962712","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"LiveBip.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://feeds.feedburner.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.alternativeadvert.com/click.php?z=30&pl=10499&ad_type=62&img=1473714806"],"sequenceId":"695194743432","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Birders participating in the Christmas Bird Count reported that two thickets that had provided habitat for certain species had been removed, and not for the purpose of construction, but for aesthetic reasons. \n \nHere\u2019s an email I received from birder Glenn Williams after I first wrote about this issue: \n \n\u201cI just read your column after being told that I was quoted in it,\u201d Williams writes. \u201cI am so glad that someone is taking the issue to the public. I just sent a description to someone who asked about it and thought that I should send you the same information. \n   \nFrom this section: \nEditorial: At this DOT, rubber actually hits the road \n  \n\u201cI have been doing the Napatree CBC since its inception and am a co-compiler. The area that I cover for the count is Watch Hill. Every year, there are less thickets. Homeowners are definitely switching from a natural and wild look to a manicured style of landscaping. The latter is of little value to birds and other animals. There is nothing that can legally be done as the areas are upland habitat. \n \n\u201cWhat bothered me most is that this year, two large wetland thicket areas were completely destroyed. I thought that there was protection for wetlands. The first is on the left of Wauwinnet Avenue (always thought that it was Watch Hill Road) as you drive into Watch Hill. It is a pond that had extensive trees and thickets. It has been clear cut to the ground all the way to the pond. There is a silt fence, but it was actually in the pond, not outside of it. The other spot is along Ocean View Highway. Wetlands were filled in to build a large house and surrounding thickets have been clear cut. This is a pretty large area that has produced numerous quality bird species in the past.\u201d \n \nWilliams\u2019 email raises a lot of questions. I began to think about whether the clear-cutting had been done at the owners\u2019 request or if it was a landscaper, a garden designer, or even a landscape architect who had just gone ahead and done it. The homeowners might not even have been in residence when it occurred, so they might not be aware that this was done on their properties. \n \nHow many property owners share Williams\u2019 perspective that most landscapes can and should also offer less-manicured places for wildlife and birds? Are people even aware of the importance of these thickets? You don\u2019t have to have a big ugly pile of sticks in your front yard, but most people can find an unobtrusive spot where they can offer cover and food to birds. \n \nPerhaps some ecologically minded group could publish a pamphlet for homeowners that would explain the value of thickets and brush piles and how a manicured landscape with a large expanse of green monoculture lawn is of no value to the ecosystem. Some people will not care, but others might. \n \nWildlife rehab courses begin \n \nThe January sub-permittee wildlife rehabilitation course has already begun, but if you have an interest in working with orphaned or injured wild animals and birds, you might want to check out the February session. This course is the first step toward becoming a state-licensed rehabilitator. \n \nI took the course a few years ago and I found it fascinating, although the calculations of medications and feeding formulas were very technical, as they have to be, since the requirements of different species are so exacting. \n \nThe course fee is $50. Wildlife Rehabilitators of Rhode Island has more information on its website: http://www.riwildliferehab.org/events \n \nPileated woodpeckers \n \nI always enjoy visiting people in other areas to see which birds are coming to their feeders. While in Quebec visiting family over the holidays, I sat in my sister\u2019s living room watching the purple finches, which I have not had at my feeders. She also gets occasional irruptions of common redpolls, which, when they descend en masse, number in the hundreds and scarf up her expensive thistle seed at an astounding rate. \n \nIt was too early in the season for the northern finches, but one morning, a pair of pileated woodpeckers that sometimes stop by swooped in and fed for several minutes at the peanut feeders.

They came in and did that and it was fun to see everything we\u2019ve been teaching, they\u2019ve been paying attention and watching and made plays. I\u2019m so happy for them.\u201d \n \nAfter Bryanna Adams hit a driving layup in the opening minute of the fourth quarter to pull CMU within one point, Catlett tipped a South Dakota Mines pass into Pipher\u2019s hands and after Adams missed a jumper, Catlett grabbed the offensive rebound and scored for a 45-44 lead with 8:41 to play. \n \n\u201cInstant energy. Tori deflected a pass and Carson stole it \u2026 they got their opportunity, and we preach it all year long, and they were the epitome of that. They gave us another life out there and we needed it,\u201d Wagner said. \n \nThe four-minute stretch allowed some starters to get a much-needed breather, and down six, Adams (14 points) and Erin Reichle (6 points) hit back-to-back jumpers and Ma\u2019ata Epenisa went inside for a layup. A pair of free throws by Adams made it a one-point game, and the Mavs ran two straight plays for Epenisa, who leads the RMAC in field goal percentage. \n \nThe junior post, who finished with 20 points, scored on both, giving the Mavericks a 59-58 lead with 1:38 to play. \n \nThe final seconds were an adventure. \n \nOn a CMU inbounds pass at midcourt, a South Dakota Mines player tipped the ball to Taylor Molstad with 14 seconds left. Rohrer missed a 3-pointer, but the rebound went out of bounds off CMU. \n \nSteffeck missed a long jumper with 2 seconds left, giving the Mavericks the weekend split before Tuesday\u2019s home game against Western State, which was also on the South Dakota swing. \n \n\u201cThe good thing is we\u2019re at home the next couple of games,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThat should give us a little more confidence.\u201d \n \nMen \n \nEimer Lopez followed his own miss for a go-ahead layup with 43 seconds remaining, and CJ Davis made one free throw with 4 seconds to play in the Mavericks\u2019 63-60 win over the Hardrockers. \n \n\u201cThe kids really played hard. A long road trip, obviously, and we\u2019re coming off a tough loss,\u201d CMU coach Andy Shantz said. \u201cMan, they came out with a good attitude like they have all year, more focused on the task at hand.\u201d \n \nDavis, who hit a pair of 3-pointers to break Colorado Mesa\u2019s career record for made 3-pointers with 156, broke the mark with 7:59 to go on a deep 3 for a 47-46 lead. As he was backpedaling down the floor celebrating, he was assessed a technical foul, and South Dakota reclaimed the lead with two free throws. \n \nThe Mavericks, who went long stretches in the second half without scoring, made some tough shots in the final minutes. Tanner Riley (10 points) muscled in a baseline jumper in traffic to cut the Hardrockers\u2019 lead to four, 57-54 and the Mavericks clamped down on defense. \n \n\u201cOur defense the last five minutes was really good,\u201d Shantz said. \u201cOur kids were aware of who was on the floor and were doubling their post and did a good job on their all-conference post (Konor Kulas, who scored 6 points).\u201d \n \nAfter a miss on the other end, the Mavericks cleared out the lane for Lopez, who scored on a driving layup and was fouled. \n \nHis free throw pulled Mesa (6-15, 5-10 RMAC) within one with 2:49 remaining. \n \n\u201cWe wanted to attack off the dribble all night,\u201d Shantz said. \u201cWe shot 23 free throws (making 16) to their 10 and that helped quite a bit. \n \nDavis, who led Mesa with 12 points, hit a jumper in the lane and made the bonus for a 59-57 lead, but Jack Fiddler\u2019s 3 gave the \u2018Rockers a one-point lead with 1:44 to play. \n \nDavis made one of two free throws with four seconds left for a 63-60 lead, but Marco Pascolo\u2019s 3 at the buzzer was off the mark. \n \n\u201cWe did a good job (defending) and they still got it to the rim,\u201d Shantz said. \u201cThe way things have been going, I\u2019m glad it banked off.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"StaffSaturday, January"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Pipher, Catlett help spark Mavericks\u2019 victory","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Montrose","zipCode":"81401","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Montrose","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683150","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1618"},"name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gjsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194744842","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T04:43:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The event served as a job fair for substitute positions as teachers, paraprofessionals, custodians, and bus drivers. \n   \nFrom this section: \nZone change requested for artist guesthouses \n  \nKimberly Sihavong, director of human resources, said 81 people had registered for the event as of 10 a.m. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m really impressed with the turnout \u2014 it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve done this so I was a little nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cWesterly is facing a substitute shortage, which is kind of a nationwide problem, and with all the kids that graduate from college in December, there\u2019s a ton of people looking for jobs and there\u2019s not a lot of jobs because it\u2019s mid-school year and this it gives them an opportunity to become employed, to find a home in the district.\u201d \n \nIn Rhode Island, substitute teaching requires a bachelor\u2019s degree but no longer requires a substitute certificate. In Westerly, the substitute per diem rate is $80, which Sihavong said was \u201cpretty average\u201d since $70 to $100 per day is the range statewide. \n \nSihavong said she didn\u2019t currently have any full-time teacher openings and wouldn\u2019t know until late spring how many positions would open up because of retirements and resignations. \n \nSubstituting can be a good career choice for those looking to get their foot in the door to eventually get a job as a teacher, but it requires dedication and commitment, she said. \n \n\u201cSubbing is like test-driving a car \u2014 every school district is different and it\u2019s a good way for them to see if it\u2019s a good place for them to end up permanently,\u201d she said. She noted that good candidates \u201ccare about the community, they care about the kids, they want to become involved; they\u2019re not just coming in, doing the work and leaving \u2014 they\u2019re engaging with us.\u201d \n \nFor Harvey Blanchette, 36, of Westerly, substitute teaching would mesh well with his parenting duties and his desire to teach. \n \n\u201cI saw the ad online and I thought it was kind of a nice opportunity and I\u2019ve been thinking about getting into education for a really long time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a stay-at-home dad with a lot going on so it seems like a nice chance to test the waters\u201d \n \nWorking on a per diem basis would provide flexibility, he said. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m responsible for my daughters most of the time and I\u2019d be able to find coverage pretty quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to have a full-time job because then you\u2019re paying for day care for the entire span of time \u2014 working a couple days a week is more manageable.\u201d \n \nNicole Fortunato, 23, came all the way from her home in Ramsey, New Jersey, to apply for the open house. A 2015 graduate of Roger Williams University, she has worked for two years as a teaching assistant in New Jersey. \n \n\u201cThey emailed that they were having the open house and I thought it was a good networking opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cI am trying to become an elementary school teacher and I want to come back to Rhode Island. I\u2019ve been a teaching assistant for two years and I\u2019m ready to teach on my own.\u201d \n \nWesterly High School Principal Todd Grimes said he was pleased with the caliber of applicants at the event. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect but I\u2019ve had some really great conversations today with some potential employees,\u201d he said. Substitute teaching, he added, \u201cis a challenging position \u2014 you need to have strong communication skills, be flexible and adaptable and work well with people because you never know what to expect and every assignment may be different.\u201d \n \nchewitt@thewesterlysun.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Substitute jobs could open doors","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"02891","state":"Rhode Island","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Westerly","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Westerly Sun","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688372","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"803"},"name":"Westerly Sun","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thewesterlysun.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194747779","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

During that time, St. Pius X School has reached out to all families with a goal of making Catholic education attainable. We are a school where families and children of all faiths are welcomed and educational needs are met: a school where families are active participants in the education of their children, and a school where the community members support both religious and educational goals. \n \nStudents need to be prepared to live a life enriched by the teachings of Christ and to integrate these skills into college and career readiness. Our mission is to carry on this rich Catholic tradition in times that are economically challenging while meeting the educational challenges of the 21st-century. How do we carry out this mission? \n \nThe ways and teachings of Jesus Christ are modeled in an environment where students demonstrate their knowledge of Catholic teachings, their growth in faith and their willingness to serve others. Students will grow academically, display critical thinking skills and use technology as a learning tool. \n   \nFrom this section: \nDowntown lunch nearly went up in smoke \n  \nAfter careful study of research-based programs, we at St. Pius X have embarked upon restructuring our school program both academically and economically. In our rebranding we are changing our name to better represent the school and services provided. St. Pius X School will be changed to St. Pius X Regional Academy. Regional reflects the many communities and parishes we serve. Academy reflects the personalizing, specializing and spiritualizing of the educational program. \n \nThe restructuring of the academic programs will begin with the implementation of a principal/academic dean leadership program. This new model directly benefits every member of our community. The academic dean will work directly with classroom teachers focusing on curriculum development, data analysis and instruction. Through a personalized, specialized and spiritualized education, we educate the child in mind, body and spirit. \n \nThrough the implementation of lead teachers and peer coaching, we will personalize and specialize the educational process. We will continue to meet the needs of all students by adding a math specialist to expand our math curriculum to include algebra 1, which will prepare students to enter grade 9 with the option of taking geometry or algebra 2. One of the responsibilities of the math specialist will be to work with teachers in grades 5 to 8 to implement the diocesan math curriculum. We will also be adding a Spanish curriculum for students in grades K to 8. The diocesan integrated curriculum will complement the STREAM (science, technology, religion, engineering, arts and mathematics) program. \u201cBring Your Own Device\u201d (ex. Chromeboook) will be implemented in grades 5 to 8. \n \nIt is our goal to keep Catholic education affordable. To that end we are implementing a tuition freeze. Sibling discount and financial assistance will also be available. For the long-term sustainability of our academy, it is imperative that we have the support of both individual benefactors and local businesses. We do not benefit from tax money. We rely solely on tuition, fundraisers and some subsidies from local Catholic parishes. In order to maintain our tradition of excellence, we are asking individuals and businesses to consider supporting us through sustained charitable giving. \n \nThrough God\u2019s blessings we are able to teach students about his great love for us and how we can better serve others. Please visit our website at westerlystpiusxschool.org or call or for an appointment to visit our academy. \n \nThe writers are the pastor of St. Pius X Church and the principal of St. Pius X Regional Academy.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Letter: St. Pius X School moving to next level as St. Pius X Regional Academy","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Washington","zipCode":"02891","state":"Rhode Island","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Westerly","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Westerly Sun","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688372","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"803"},"name":"Westerly Sun","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thewesterlysun.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://westerlystpiusxschool.org/"],"sequenceId":"695194749386","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I haven\u2019t seen any sales figures, but  according to a story in The New York Times , the book\u2019s publisher just ordered a 75,000-copy reprint to meet the new demand and was considering yet further printings. Those are remarkable numbers. What happened? \n \nI would have liked to think that the spike in sales happened in response to my essay about Orwell and the assault on free speech in the academy in this month\u2019s New Criterion . I\u2019ll come back to my observations about 1984 later on.  First, however, candor requires that I acknowledge that it was not my essay that sparked the surprising flood of sales. \n \nNo, the reason for the book\u2019s new success was Donald Trump.  Was it just another example of the Trump Bump, his doing for the publishing industry what he has done to the Dow Jones average (up by 9% since the election), foreign investment in the U.S., and basic country-wide confidence that the country is getting back on the right track? \n \nNot quite. When I say that \u201cDonald Trump\u201d was responsible for the sudden and unexpected surge in sales of 1984, what I mean is that the media seized upon a remark by Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway in response to the controversy over the number of people who viewed Trump\u2019s inauguration a week ago.  Trump opined that one and a half million people attended the festivities. The media laughed at that number, claiming it was much lower. Sean Spicer, in his first appearance as the administration\u2019s press secretary, insisted that Trump was right and that, in fact, \u201cthat was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period. Both in person and around the globe.\u201d The media went to town on that, emitting dozens of articles with graphs, charts, statistics, and expert testimony. According to their count, what Trump, and Spicer, said was demonstrably false. \n \nIn one gleeful exchange  on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Chuck Todd repeatedly pressed Kellyanne Conway on the issue.  Why Did President Trump and then his press secretary deliberately lie about the facts of the size of the crowd at the inauguration? Conway parried that the press seemed determined to put the new administration in a bad light. For one thing, she noted, we didn\u2019t really know what the total number of people who watched the inauguration was. For another, the press, fixated on crowd size, essentially ignored a reporter\u2019s tweet that Trump had had the bust of Martin Luther King Jr. removed from the Oval Office when that really was demonstrably false.

This institution is that special place where the best talent in the military may engage in fertile intellectual exchange with some of the brightest   in our civilian institutions and from other nations. The laymen often mistakenly view the military as an   inflexible, often unthinking collective. This is a distorted view of the military. \n \nSome of the best minds in our nation are found in the military.   No military can be successful over the long-term unless it has the intellectual agility to adopt its doctrines and practices to the challenges of a dynamic   and chaotic world as we have today. Like any large organization, a military overly resistant to change will find itself on the wrong end of history. It will not answer the questions an incessantly changing environment places before it. \nThe Nigerian military was established to respond to challenges resident in Third Generation or Trinitarian Warfare. The genesis of standard military philosophy can be traced to the works of classical and neo-classical theorists and practitioners such as Sun Tzu, Jomini (Joe-me-knee), Clausewitz (Clau sah vits), Alfred Mahan, Giulio Douhet (Do-hay), JFC Fuller and Basil Liddell Hart. \nToday, much of the world\u2019s military challenges have little to do with the confrontation of standing army against standing army. You now must adapt your concepts and your very institution to Fourth Generation or Non-trinitarian Warfare. Here, you deal with the intersection of ideology, politics and highly weaponized non-state actors whose membership, tactics and aims are fluid and inconstant. \n \nIn the space of the last ten years, the Nigerian military has had to face violent militants in the tropical Niger Delta, then turn to battle wicked Boko Haram in the Sahelian Northern Nigeria. The principles of Jomini and Clausewitz have to be materially reinterpreted to apply to these battles. Yet these conflicts are of a different nature than what these 19th century thinkers encountered, but these modern conflicts are as brutal, and strategically important to the state as traditional warfare. This modern version is even more difficult to master and to win due to the fluid, almost clandestine nature of the adversary. Today, you battle   not against standing armies; but against vanishing ghosts. \n \nI commend the Nigerian military for what it has achieved against Boko Haram.   You have battled and bested this evil enterprise. This vile force has been reduced to where it no longer poses a strategic threat.    You have done as well as a military can in putting down this amorphous danger.   The nation thanks you. I must say here, however, that we cannot lower our guard. \n \nWe have learned cardinal lessons from the Boko Haram crisis. First, we must govern justly and for the benefit of the people to prevent the recurrence of violent extremism in the future. \n \nWidespread poverty caused by an unjust allocation of income, wealth and resources provides fertile ground for extremist ideologies, that run contrary to the inclusive democracy we seek to perfect. \n \nProtracted years of gross mis-governance are a down payment on the rise of extremism. \n \nSecond, the armed forces may contain violent outbreaks but they cannot fully resolve strife originating from a nation\u2019s political and social imbalances. Some type of political resolution is needed. \n \nThe military is hamstrung because it must restrain operations in order to protect the civilian population, which is the prime duty of the military. A paradox of fourth generation warfare becomes apparent. The duty to protect the state is rendered more complex because of the restraint that must be exercised in combating domestic insurgencies. However, engaging in less discrete operations may be easier done but this always proves counterproductive in the end because of the risk of alienating the local population. \n \nThird, the longer an unfair political economic situation goes unattended, the more extreme become the views of the disaffected. The more difficult a political situation becomes, once the situation degrades into violent insurgency. There is little room to find a political solution and almost no mutual trust to attempt to locate that finite space. As a result, the nation is compelled to resort to force, to resolve non-military contradictions. This means the more the military has to expend itself in a contest of diminishing military returns. The more time that passes, the more the military is degraded. A conventional military is not structured to be on perpetual war footing. More resources have to be spent to prevent the military from diminishing its current state of readiness. \n \nThe insurgency becomes institutionalized with each passing year. Insurgent ideology gives way to institutional inertia. Insurgency becomes something its members do simply because they have been doing it. It is no longer a means to an end; the insurgency becomes the end in itself. \n \nEnough of my layman\u2019s attempt at military theorizing for the moment. Yet, what I have said underscores a crucial point.   The civilian and military worlds do not   occupy distinct universes. They are but different points along the spectrum of collective human endeavor. For a nation at our stage of evolution, any politician who cares about internal security must be somewhat versed in military concepts and strategy. Any military officer who cares about the future progress of the nation must be conversant with the different political and economic themes contesting to govern the moment. \n \nI was asked to speak about Strategic Leadership: My Experiences. I shall do so. But, since I am not in uniform, permit me a touch of insubordination. I have slightly amended my message to be \u201cStrategic Leadership: My Personal Theory and Practice.\u201d \n \nMY THEORY OF STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP \n \nExcellent strategic political leadership is based on commitment to a political vision. A leader must have a coherent objective in mind. Strategy and tactics are then fashioned to work toward that vision. \n \nThis is an essential consideration. There cannot be strategic leadership without a conscious objective. Political leadership in Nigeria generally has fallen    short in this regard. Leadership has been short-sighted and fixed on narrow, immediate objectives. Because of this, leadership has been more transactional than strategic in nature.   It has been more focused on the retention of power and control than on the substantive results and long-term consequences of its policies and actions. \n APC leader, Bola Tinubu \nThis state of affairs results in a cruel paradox. Fixation on the details of numerous transactions produces a mirage of control and order over every event and episode. However, when all the pieces are brought together, they give a picture of disorder and even chaos. Excessive control over individual parts comes at the sacrifice of harmony of the whole. The parts do not fit well together because they were not created as a unified whole. \n \nThings become as confusing as a labyrinth, with many entrances but no exits. It is as if we take 20 authors asking each to write a separate chapter of a book, without coordinating with each other. In this way, we protect ourselves from the writers plotting against us. While that objective is achieved, there is little chance that the book will be a coherent tale when we tack the chapters together. Each section will be fine in isolation. When read together, they constitute nothing more than literary confusion, intelligent babble. The totality of the work becomes less than the sum of its parts. So much energy expended towards almost no discernible purpose, except to control the process no matter how dysfunctional the outcome. \n \nThis is the bane of our political economy. We have so much talent in the nation but it has not been engaged and engineered to function in unison.   Fiscal policy does not mesh with monetary policy. Trade policy undermined industrial policy, thus ease of doing business is inhibited. Overseas peacekeeping missions do not always harmonize with core foreign policy interests. \n \nNo national system is perfect. In each, exist some contradictions. This is but evidence of the imperfection of human nature itself. However, a nation in progress seeks to minimize, not harvest additional   contradictions, otherwise its leadership strategy is doomed to fail. \n \nThese dilemmas arise in governance because there is no accepted overarching vision or strategy to achieve that vision. In the absence of these essentials that give definition to inputs and outcomes, coherence gives way to happenstance. Unaided by a greater purpose, governance and its institutions become ends in themselves. Their primary aim will be to exist, not to achieve. Leaders likewise become imbued with the same blindness. They occupy power because power needs to be occupied. \n \nI was fortunate to recognize early in my political life   that a true political leader distinguishes himself by marrying principled vision with practical strategy. In combination, these things show you the way home and how to get there.   Just as importantly, they help you determine what not to do or where to avoid as a good compass keeps you from going south when your destination lies north. \n \nDeveloping vision and strategy are easily said but hard to attain.   Thought, diligent planning and constant reflection are needed. \n \nPresident Dwight Eisenhower once said: \u201cIn preparing for battle, I have always found plans are useless but planning is indispensable.\u201d The deeper meaning of this statement is priceless. \n \nYou may set forth intelligently crafted plans. Once the complex enterprise begins, war or politics, unforeseen events and untold chance stirs the dust and changes things so quickly that the strict letter of our plans loses utility. \n \nAny general or leader who stubbornly adheres to preconceived notions has written his own tombstone: here lies a leader who defeated himself. \n \nNo matter the beauty of your intellectual constructs, they cannot subdue reality; they must adapt to it.   The plan can be a prison but the planning is essential. It conditions the mind to keep an eye on the objective so that you may adapt to changing conditions without losing sight of the prize. \n \nAt this juncture, I am reminded of the tale of a farmer and his son.   The farmer\u2019s corn fields were plagued by ravening birds.    Saving the harvest clearly became his objective. His strategy was to have his son gather stones, early every day, then toss them at the crows to scare them off. This went on daily for several months. \n \nOne day, the crows did not come.   The boy spotted the birds in the adjacent fields of his father\u2019s worst enemy.    Conditioned to bothering the crows, the boy hauled rocks to the other man\u2019s field so that he may pelt the crows. While the boy was gone, wild pigs came and trampled the much of the cornstalks. \n \nThe father spotted the boy and scream for him to come home. The boy came running. The father asked why was he being so disobedient. The boy was perplexed, saying   you wanted me to chase the crows away. \n \nThe father answered: \u201cNo.\u201d I wanted you to protect our corn. While here, the birds were our enemy. Not here, they are just birds. When they are in that man\u2019s field, they are even my friends. \n \n\u201cMy son, you forgot the purpose of what you were doing. So you set yourself elsewhere and left the field unattended to bother birds that were doing us no harm. By your mistake, you just undid all the toil of these months and you put the harvest at risk.\u201d \n \nMy constant vision has been the transformation of this nation into a robust decentralized democracy with a diverse industrial base, to provide sufficient jobs to a growing urban population; and a sufficient agricultural base, to achieve food security and provide a decent livelihood to the rural population. \n \nWe have made some progress toward this vision. But we have a long way to go. I want to sketch out the journey thus far and offer my thoughts on how the future might unfold. \n \nSTRATEGIC LEADERSHIP  IN PRACTICE \n \nWHERE HAVE WE BEEN?  \n \nDuring the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s, a progressive politician like me was at extreme odds with the military.   This    opposition was not against the military as the military. It was against military governance. Military governance was diametrically opposed to the democratic Nigeria I envisioned. \n \nThe permanent aim was to attain democratic governance. During this period, the strategic objective had to be the exit of the military from power.   Tactics would be devised to meet the moment. The tactics   ranged from cooperation with the military during the SDP/NRC aborted transition to outright protests at home and seeking international condemnation of the succeeding military regime when it sought to perpetuate itself in power. \n \nWhen that regime became increasingly brutal, tactics   changed. Some of us were arrested and detained; some of us went into exile. We could not contest muscle for muscle against the regime. Instead, we engineered a strategic retreat to be outside the regime\u2019s strong reach.   From this distance, we still did an effective job canvassing the nation and international community to support democracy and freedom.   Our words were akin to long range artillery or air power. The military controlled the ground but we held supremacy in the air waves. We were winning the battle for the hearts and minds of people. \n \nPlease take note here. My opposition was based on the fact that the hierarchical and centralized command inherent to military institutions was ill suited for   democratic governance. While individual military officers may transform into successful democratic leaders, the institution as a whole constituted a brake on democracy. \n \nWe worked to ease the military from the political arena. There would be no recrimination or backlash against the institution. Once the military was out of politics, my opposition to the military ended. \n \nOthers in the pro-democracy struggle embraced a more hardline position.   Some wanted the military to be put in the docks. They wanted to weaken it as national institution.   In my estimation, they gave more weight to temporary strategy than the overall objective. \n \nThey had fought against military rule so long that they came to believe the goal was to defeat the military.   No. The deeper truth was the return to democratic governance. Ending institutional military control of politics was merely the way to reach that end. \n \nFortunately, our less combative approach won the day. The military exited governance but was not persecuted. It returned to being the strong unifying national institution it has always been. \n \nImagine if those who advocated a punitive approach   had won the day. The military would have been greatly weakened. Such a broken outfit would not have summoned the leadership and dedication necessary to tackle both the Niger Delta militancy and Boko Haram\u2019s terror. \n \nThis is an important lesson. Narrow focus and the unwitting conflation of strategy with ultimate objective can be dangerous in the affairs of a nation. \n \nCivilian Rule Came. I was elected governor of Lagos in the AD (Alliance for Democracy), which came to be the pre-eminent party in the Southwest. The PDP controlled the federal government and most states. Quickly, it revealed itself to be a party of authoritarian excess. It boasted it would rule the country for 60 years. Just as quickly I came to the realization that continuation of PDP national leadership might be the death knell of my dream of a democratic Nigeria.   As a democrat, I understood equal competition meant that my party could lose a free and fair elections. I was and remain ready to take a fair loss. Yet, I was and remain unprepared to see victory stolen from the rightful winner and to see any party install itself in near perpetuity, notwithstanding the expressed will of the people. \n \nMy strategic goal became the defeat of the PDP at the national level during this period.   When the 2003 election came, the PDP dangled an alliance before the AD. The proposal was that if we supported the PDP at the presidential level the PDP would not oppose us at the state level. Because of my strategic perspective and the previous legal confrontations I had with the federal government due to its overreach, I rejected the proposal. It sounded too easy to be good.   Sadly, some of my colleagues lost sight of the long-term objective; they were enticed to chase after short-term promises. Those promises were hollow. My friends chased themselves into a corner. Their non-opposition to the PDP at the presidential level would be repaid with deception. The   PDP outflanked them in the gubernatorial race. \n \nLagos was to be the only state with an AD governor. From this setback and crippled position, we began the long journey that would reduce the PDP\u2019s boast of ruling for 60 years to just 16. \n \nWHERE WE ARE NOW \n \nLeading into the 2015 election season, progressive politicians throughout Nigeria and across party lines recognized the nation was in deep trouble. Corruption was rampant. The Boko Haram menace growing. The   economy was unbalanced and government policy was not providing the right growth catalysts despite favorable oil prices. PDP governance had overstayed its welcome. The people were ready for change. And we must develop the strategic leadership and determination to achieve the change. \n \nStanding as separate parties, we could not best the PDP. We had tried that path; it led to defeat in 2011. A strategic rethink was needed. \n \nTo attain the goal of ousting the PDP and placing Nigeria on the road to progressive governance,   the strategic linchpin would be the merger of opposition parties. \n \nTime is inadequate to recount the complex journey toward the merger.   My firm position was that only a merger would work. Anything short of that would disintegrate due to a combination of PDP enticement and the internal pressures arising from the strong identification of many politicians with their legacy parties. An ad-hoc alliance would be put asunder by these factors. \n \nOur push for a merger of the old parties into a new entity carried the day.   We would join hands to form a   collective identity. The CPC and my party, ACN,   ANPP a long with progressive elements of the APGA formed the party. Key elements of the PDP would later join.   For this amalgamation to work, it had to be more than an anti-PDP gathering. It had to present a genuine, positive message that spoke to people\u2019s hopes and aspirations. \n \nWe developed the theme of change as our strategic message. The broom became an apt party symbol. We would sweep out the old, sweep in the new and work hard towards prosperity for our country. \n \nWe fashioned a tripartite campaign message and strategy message. Security, Economy and Corruption.   We would drive these three messages home as if with military artillery. However, we have only our leadership and strategic hammer. \n \nStill all of this would have been to no avail without the right candidate. Given his stature and reputation for integrity, honest dealing and patriotic commitment, there really was no other candidate to have carried the day, than then General Muhammadu Buhari. \n \nYet, even with such a figure as our candidate, we foresaw the need to construct a public relations strategy to counter false accusations of religious intolerance and parochialism that would be hurled at him. We did this with great success because we prepared for these attacks beforehand. \n \nWe established other democratic and leadership strategies for our success, details of which time would not permit me to reveal here. We did not have the vast war chest of the PDP. Our efforts had to be sharper and more compelling. We accomplished this task. \n \nWe did not win the election by accident. I had studied the resulting and voting patterns of all the prior elections since 1999. Our team did an honest assessment and detailed assessment of our strengths and weaknesses and those of our opponents. \n \nTo win, we knew the votes we needed and identified the likely places and demographic constituencies from which the bulk of those votes must come. We did not waste time chasing votes we would not get. We concentrated on our strengths and the other side\u2019s weaknesses, realising that our defence must be as tight as if we are inside the War College here in Abuja. \n \nThe other factor is one that is little spoken of. Our early insistence on biometric voter registration and the use of the card reader on voting day were of strategic importance as it is essential to safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process. In past elections, PDP vote padding had been massive in certain areas.   We had to curtail this malpractice to achieve the objective of making the election as fair as possible, allowing us a chance to win. \n \nThe card reader minimized the rigger\u2019s ability to steal the election. Before its use, results could be written without regard to the number of actual people who cast ballots. In a polling booth where 50 people actually showed up to vote, the rigger could falsify figures and claim that 500 votes were cast. With the card reader, the rigger could steal no more than 50 votes. The tallies could not be inflated beyond the number of actual voters. \n \nUpon these strategic pillars, we built historic victory. For the first time in the nation\u2019s history, incumbent president and party lost the national election. This historic transition further cemented our democratic evolving tradition and structures, advancing us closer to the overarching vision that guides my political actions. \n \nCompleting a personal transition, General Buhari would become President Buhari. And former President Goodluck Jonathan would become a stateman, winning worldwide commendation for conceding defeat, even before the final results were announced. \n \nWHERE WE ARE GOING \n \nIn relative short order, the Buhari administration has done what the prior government seem unable to do. With the courage and dedication of the military, Boko Haram has been subdued. Also, notable and significant progress is being made against corruption. Press freedoms and civil liberties are protected, putting to lie those who cried that President Buhari would not respect democracy and rule of law. \n \nTo move closer to the overarching vision I outlined, we now have to shift primary focus to the economic front. \n \nThe decline of high oil prices threatens to be a long-term phenomenon. It placed the nation in recession last year and revealed the structural weaknesses of our national economy. \n \nStrategic objectives during this period of economic uncertainty must be to re-engineer the economy bottom up, diversify the economic base, strengthen our industrial base, modernize infrastructure,    enhance agriculture, and provide employment. And of course, ease of doing business must not be overlooked in order to attract foreign investment. \n \nThe lower oil prices also reduced hard currency earnings. This undermined the naira, causing a steep rise in the cost of imports. The higher prices have suppressed aggregate demand, causing a decline in business activity. \n \nThe challenge before us is a difficult   but not impossible one. If we stick to the progressive beliefs of the APC, we shall overcome these difficulties to place the economy on surer permanent footing. \n \nGovernment has shown its commitment to these ideals   via its budget for this year and by the strong help it is giving state governments to meet their budgetary requirements. The unprecedented stipend program for the poorest highlights the government\u2019s concern for those who have been left unattended by the dynamics of the marketplace. \n \nAchieve the desired economic restructuring will require a change in economic mindset and strategy.   We must avoid the nostrums of mainstream orthodoxy that say government deficits are always bad. In the situation we face, deficit spending is essential to bolster aggregate demand and direct funds to projects that build infrastructure and bolster employment. \n \nWe must better harmonize monetary policy with fiscal policy. It undercuts our goals if monetary policy is unduly tight at a time fiscal policy begets deficit spending. \n \nWe must also realign trade policy with our need to create a meaningful industrial base and more potent agricultural sector. We can no longer allow cheap imports to preclude the development of industries and sectors strategic to our enduring economic future. \n \n  CONCLUSION \n \nMy public life spans over three decades. I have had my share of triumphs.

They have asked district staff to catalog what needs to be updated and fixed, and board members have visited every school in the district to talk to teachers and staff about their school\u2019s needs. \n \nThat includes a $58 million list of critical repair needs, as well as security updates, building additions and funding full-day kindergarten. \n \nThe school board will make a decision in coming months whether to pursue a bond measure and mill levy override in the November election. \n \nBut as board members move toward that decision, the school district\u2019s failed 2011 mill levy override attempt is still fresh. The $12.5 million measure was voted down by more than 60 percent of voters. \n \nBoard member Greg Mikolai, who was on the board in 2011, said he wants to be careful about how the district and school board ask voters for more funding. He said he is wary of repeatedly asking for a tax increase when voters have recently voted one down. \n \n\u201cBack in 2011, we did a poll and we heard people liked the idea of this, and they liked the idea of this, but they don\u2019t want to pay for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we haven\u2019t even gone forward and attempted until six years later because we lost so badly. That\u2019s a political reality.\u201d \n \nSchool board members will likely pursue a professional poll to gauge the community\u2019s interest in increasing taxes to fund schools. \n \nDistrict 51 is also applying for the state\u2019s competitive Building Excellent Schools Today grant in order to replace Orchard Mesa Middle School, a 56-year-old building with a long list of repair needs. \n \nDirector of Maintenance Eric Nilsen said the state\u2019s facility assessor visited Orchard Mesa last week. \n \nThe grant would be for approximately $13 million, but BEST grants are conditional on community support. Even if the district won the grant, if voters didn\u2019t agree to pay for the new school, the school district would not get the grant money. \n \nNilsen said a poll or other evidence of public support might be needed to win the grant. \n \n\u201cWhen they commit that size of a grant they want some confidence that the community is going to support it,\u201d he said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Katie LangfordSaturday, January"},"topics":[{"name":"Tax news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"School board gun-shy about seeking tax hike","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Montrose","zipCode":"81401","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Montrose","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683150","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1618"},"name":"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.gjsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194753480","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:02:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The defining characteristic of a startup is that of experimentation \u2013 in order to have a chance of survival every startup has to be good at performing the experiments that are necessary for the discovery of a successful business model. 3 As an investor, I hope that each early stage startup in which I have made an investment matures into a company. \n \nStrategy is about making choices, trade-offs; it\u2019s about deliberately choosing to be different. \n \n\u2013 Michael Porter 4 \n \nDefinition #2: What is Strategy?  An early stage startup\u2019s strategy is that deliberate set of integrated choices it makes in order to create a sustainable competitive advantage within its market relative to rival startups and market incumbents. It is the means by which a startup combines all the elements within its environment to create and deliver value for its customers, while simultaneously capturing some of that value for itself and its investors. Strategy answers questions about what the startup should do and what it should not do in order to find a repeatable, scalable and profitable business model. \n \n \nStrategy as an Integrated Cascade of Choices: From Playing to Win, by A.G. Lafley and Robert L. Martin. HBR Press (2013) \n  \nSome additional observations about strategy; \n  Strategy can be granular and tangible or broad and intangible. It is granular and tangible as one goes further down the organizational hierarchy. It is broad and intangible as one approaches the top of an organization.  Strategy helps a startup decide how to utilise its internal and external resources and capabilities towards reaching its ultimate goals and objectives.  In a growth stage startup or mature company, effective strategy makes choices and trade-offs in the following areas;  Supply chain  Manufacturing, product development  Distribution channels  Human resources  Finance  Research and development  Operations    For an early stage startup strategy involves choices and trade-offs in the following areas;  Value propositions  Customers \u2013 segments, relationships  Key activities  Key resources  Key partners  Cost structure  Revenue streams     \n \nAlex Osterwalder\u2019s Business Model Canvas, from the book Business Model Generation \n  \nStrategic Decision Making Tools for Early Stage Technology Startups \n \nPorter\u2019s 5 Forces :   In a 1\u2033>2008 update to his 1979 HBR Article: How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy , Michael E. Porter discusses the \u201c5 Forces\u201d that have a direct impact on strategy. \n \n \nMichael E. Porter \u2013 The Five Forces That Shape Industry Competition Image Credit: Harvard Business Review (2008) \n  \nThreat of New Entrants : This is the degree to which a startup can expect to face intense competition because the number of direct rivals it faces keeps increasing. Direct rivals are other startups that enter the market with a value proposition that is nearly identical to that which a given an incumbent startup is offering its customers. High threat of new entrants imposes a ceiling on profitability, limits how much value an incumbent startup can capture for itself, and imposes high costs on the existing competitors within the industry or market. As a result, it is important for startup founders to think about how they might construct an economic moat around their business. Michael Porter discusses seven major sources of barriers to entry; supply-side economies of scale, demand-side benefits of scale, customer switching costs , capital requirements, incumbency advantages independent of size, unequal access to distribution channels, and restrictive government policy. \n \nBargaining Power of Suppliers : Suppliers become powerful when they form a more concentrated group than the startups that they sell to and do not rely on startups for the significant proportion of their revenues. Additional factors leading to supplier power include; the suppliers offer products that are differentiated and unique, startups face high switching costs in moving from that supplier group to an alternative product, a lack of satisfactory alternatives to the product or service provided by the supplier group. These factors combine to put the suppliers in an enormously strong negotiating position, and enables them to maintain high prices and pass nearly all cost increases on to their startup customers. \n \nBargaining Power of Buyers : This is the opposite of supplier power. Powerful buyers can have a debilitating impact on the profitability of a group of startups that supply them with goods or services. The factors that contribute to powerful buyers are; a small number of buyers with each purchasing in large volumes relative to the size of each incumbent startup, buyers perceive and experience no switching costs if they switch from one startup\u2019s products to products supplied by one of its competitors, the quality and reliability or lack thereof of products or services provided by suppliers does not affect the buyers\u2019 ability to maintain or improve the quality of their goods or services. \n \nThreat of Substitutes : This has not happened recently, but it used to be that when I would ask a founder \u201cWho is your competition?\u201d the quick response would be \u201cWe do not have any competition!\u201d I\u2019d shake my head and think to myself, they must not understand the meaning of substitute. According to Michael Porter \u201cA substitute performs the same or a similar function as an industry\u2019s product by a different means.\u201d For example, videoconferencing is a substitute for travel. The threat posed by substitutes can be camouflaged by the apparent difference between the way an early stage startup perceives its customer value proposition and the way its customers perceive that same value proposition in comparison to the substitute. One way to think of substitutes is to ask \u201cHow are customers fulfilling that need or solving that problem now?\u201d Another way to think about substitutes is to ask the question \u201cWhere are customers spending less money because they have chosen to buy our product?\u201d Industry profitability is constrained by a high threat of substitutes. Consider the threat posed to social-networking like Twitter and Facebook from the chat and messaging apps. Facebook has been more responsive to those threats, and has strengthened its strategic position through its acquisitions of Instagram , Oculus Rift  and Whatsapp . The threat posed by substitutes is high if customers are indifferent to the price-performance trade-offs they have to make if they switch to the substitute. The threat is also high if switching costs to customers are minimal, or non-existent. To find examples of how the threat of substitutes functions, think of the threat that Facebook is posing to Google\u2019s business model of selling ads tied to users\u2019 search activity. Or the threat that the shift from desktop-centric to mobile-centric computing poses to all kinds of businesses that have been built from the desktop centric point of view. Or the current debates around the relationship between startups in the on-demand economy and their employees, and the implications for the startups that are currently on either either side of that debate. 5 \n \nRivalry Among Existing Competitors : Think Uber and Lyft, Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, Apple iTunes and Spotify/Pandora etc, Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android, Apple\u2019s iPhone and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy, Apple\u2019s Watch and the burgeoning number of wearables designed and produced by other competitors in that market. Evidence of intense rivalries among existing competitors is found in frequent price-cuts, ubiquitous sales and marketing campaigns, and relatively short product and service upgrade cycles. Combined with the threat of new entrants, rivalry among existing competitors leads to a land-grab by incumbents to access new markets where rivalry is less intense and potentially lock rivals in other markets out of the new markets. A land-grab could also be initiated in anticipation of intense rivalry developing in the future. The on-demand ride-sharing wars that are playing out around the world today provide a text-book example of this phenomenon. High rivalry among existing competitors constrains profitability along two dimensions; the intensity of the competition, as well as the basis on which that competition is taking place. Factors that contribute to a high intensity of rivalry are: Competitors roughly equal in size, slow growth, high exit barriers, high levels of commitment to the market and the industry, and poor signaling. One mistake rivals often make? They engage in mutually destructive price-cuts in succeeding rounds of attack and retaliation. Or, they might engage in other tactics that lead to an overall degradation of the customer experience or user experience for their mutual customers. Particularly destructive behavior is most liable to occur when the individual rivals\u2019 products cannot be differentiated from one another by their target customers, the rivals are each faced with a cost structure characterized by high fixed costs and low marginal costs, it is difficult to make quick capacity adjustments in response to surges or declines in demand, and the product is perishable. 6 Ideally, competition among rivals should aim to grow the profitability of the industry or market for all players within it, while raising barriers to entry. \n \nFactors that influence strategy : In debates about strategy with other management theorists, academics and practitioners, Michael Porter has stated; \n \nIt is especially important to avoid the common pitfall of mistaking certain visible attributes of an industry for its underlying structure. \n \nHe describes the following factors that influence strategy and competition within an industry; \n  Industry growth rate  Technology and innovation  Government  Complementary products and services   \nThe key is for startup founders and their investors to analyze each of the five forces that shape competitive strategy within the context of each of these factors. The factors are not inherently good or bad, but must be assessed in the context of the the five forces and the impact they have on developments within the industry. \n \n \nJack Bauer, the star character in 24 always seems to be thinking several steps ahead of everyone else surrounding him.

He appears ambushed, trapped, outnumbered and outgunned by them. \n \nDefinition #3: What is Game Theory? According to Wolfram Mathworld; \u201cGame theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the analysis of games (i.e., situations involving parties with conflicting interests). In addition to the mathematical elegance and complete \u201csolution\u201d which is possible for simple games, the principles of game theory also find applications to complicated games such as cards, checkers, and chess, as well as real-world problems as diverse as economics, property division, politics, and warfare. \n \nGame theory has two distinct branches: combinatorial game theory and classical game theory. \n \nCombinatorial game theory covers two-player games of perfect knowledge such as go , chess , or checkers . Notably, combinatorial games have no chance element, and players take turns. \n \nIn classical game theory, players move, bet, or strategize simultaneously. Both hidden information and chance elements are frequent features in this branch of game theory, which is also a branch of economics.\u201d 7 \n \nFor a flavor of the wide application of game theory; \n  Malcolm Gladwell attempted to apply it to analysis of athletic prowess in this May 2006 article in The new Yorker .  Michael A. Lewis, then a professor at the Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College in NYC applied probability and game theory to an analysis of The Hunger Games in this April 2012 article in Wired.  Clive Thompson writes about a claim by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, a professor at my alma mater New York University and \u201cone of the world\u2019s most prominent applied game theorists\u201d that he could predict when Iran will get the nuclear bomb in this August 2009 article in the New York Times Magazine article.   \nPlaying The Right Game \u2013 Using Game Theory To Shape Strategy : In their 1995 Harvard Business Review article \u2013 The Right Game: Use Game Theory to Shape Strategy  Adam M. Brandenburger and Barry Nalebuff offer advice that startup founders can use to guide the choices they make as they navigate the terrain that lies between their startup\u2019s emergence as an embryonic organization and its hopeful maturity into a company. \n \nUnlike war and sports, business is not about winning and losing. Nor is it about how well you play the game. Companies can succeed spectacularly without requiring others to fail. And they can fail miserably no matter how well they play if they make the mistake of playing the wrong game. The essence of business success lies in making sure you\u2019re playing the right game. \n \nFollowing are some observations based on their paper: \n  There are two basic types of games; rule-based games and freewheeling games. Business is a complex mix of both.  To aid them formulate their startup\u2019s strategy, the startup\u2019s founders and investors must think far out into the future to make postulations about how the game might unfold by analyzing how all the players in the game will react to moves by another player in the game. This involves reasoning forward and then reasoning backwards to the present in order to determine what actions taken today will lead to the outcome that the startup wishes to bring into existence in the future. They state: \u201cFor rule-based games, game theory offers the principle, To every action, there is a reaction. But, unlike Newton\u2019s third law of motion, the reaction is not programmed to be equal and opposite.\u201d  The startup\u2019s founders must eschew egocentrism and instead embrace allocentrism, i.e. they must focus less on their startup\u2019s actions but rather must focus on the actions, desires, expectations, ambitions, goals, objectives etc. etc. of their rivals. They state: \u201cTo look forward and reason backward, you have to put yourself in the shoes\u2014even in the heads\u2014of other players. To assess your added value, you have to ask not what other players can bring to you but what you can bring to other players.\u201d  Startup founders should seek and create opportunities for \u201cCoopetition\u201d \u2013 \u201cIt means looking for win-win as well as win-lose opportunities. Keeping both possibilities in mind is important because win-lose strategies often backfire.\u201d They cite the example of a price war as a move that ultimately leaves all the players in a game worse off because it reestablishes the status quo, but at a lower price. Starting a price war is a lose-lose move.  It is important to think of the players within a startup\u2019s Value Net; an environment created by the startup\u2019s customers and suppliers \u2013 arranged vertically in the Value Net framework, and its substitutors and complementors \u2013 arranged horizontally in the Value Net. The startup itself is positioned where the Value Net axes intersect. The startup transacts with its counterparties positioned along the vertical axis \u2013 resources and money flow between the startup and its customers and suppliers. The startup does not transact directly with its substitutors or complementors, but it interacts with them nonetheless. Often, strategists do not pay sufficient attention to how a startup\u2019s interactions with its substitutors and complementors can be modified in order to create win-win outcomes for the players in the startup\u2019s Value Net. They recommend drawing the Value Net, and monitoring changes that occur to the elements of the game using that map.  The elements of a game are; The Players \u2013 customers, suppliers, substitutors, complementors and, of course, the startup itself. The Added Values \u2013 this is what each player brings to the game, and the key task here is to consider means by which the startup might make itself a more valuable player. The Rules \u2013 in business these are fluid and likely not transparent, although this is not always so, also the players in the game might agree to change them. Tactics \u2013 these are short term moves the startup makes in order to shape how it is perceived by other players in the game, or to maintain uncertainty within the game for its benefit. The scope \u2013 these are the boundaries of the game. Founders might consider expanding or shrinking the boundaries of the game in keeping with what they believe works best for the ultimate outcomes that the startups wishes to realize.  The authors discuss \u201cThe Traps of Strategy\u201d \u2013 briefly outlined;  The startup does not have to accept the game that it finds itself in.  The startup does not have to change the game at the expense of other players within its Value Net.  The startup does not have to be unique to succeed. On its own, uniqueness is an insufficient dimension along which to pursue success.  Founders\u2019 failure to study and see the whole game can prove expensive and fatal because any moves towards one group of players in the game has counterpart move with the other players along that axis. Draw the Value Net.  Founders\u2019 failure to think methodically about changing the game can prove expensive, focusing inwardly on the startup instead of outwardly on the other players within the Value Net limits the strategic options available. Use PARTS.     \nThe Goals Grid \u2013 A Tool for Clarifying Goals and Objectives : I discovered The Goals Grid in 2009 while working on two turnaround assignments, and feeling dissatisfied with the tools I had acquired in business school \u2013 it quickly became clear to me that those tools did not translate readily when I was in the trenches, working with people on the frontlines of fine-dining, and general aviation, who lacked the training in strategy and management that students in MBA programs in the United States receive. I needed something I could discuss with them, but that they could then implement without me. 8 \n \nThe Goals Grid focuses startup founders\u2019 attention by asking 4 questions; \n  What are you trying to achieve?  What are you trying to preserve?  What are you trying to avoid?  What are you trying to eliminate?   \nIt then connects these questions to the problems the startup\u2019s founders seek to solve by rephrasing those questions; \n  What do you want that you don\u2019t have? You should be trying to achieve this.  What do you already have that you already have? You should preserve this.  What do you lack that you don\u2019t want? Avoid this.  What do you have now that you do not want? Eliminate this as quickly as possible.   \nThe analyses can be performed using the grid below. \n \n \nThe Goals Grid by Fred Nickols. Image Credit: http://www.advocus.co.uk \n  \nSome observations about the goals grid; \n  It is super flexible, and can be used at multiple levels in an organization. It can be used for corporate-wide strategic planning activities as well as team or individual-contributor level tactical planning.  The ease with which this analyses can be performed make it possible to unshackle the goals grid from our general notions of strategic planning cycles. There is nothing to prevent individuals or small teams within a startup from creating whatever cycle they need to create in order to use the goals grid to accomplish objectives, keep one another accountable. For example in certain circumstances it might make sense to have a monthly goals grid planning and update cycle. In another context perhaps quarterly cycles make more sense. Yet still, in some other context, perhaps weekly goals grid planning cycles make sense.  While they do not explicitly mention using the goals grid at Pandora, this case study published in the First Round Review shows how powerful a system analogous to this can become \u2013 The Product Prioritization System That Nabbed Pandora 70 Million Monthly Users with Just 40 Engineers .  If it is used, the goals grid should be applied to each component of a startup\u2019s business model while it is in the search and discovery phase of its existence.   \nThe \u201cDo Not Fucking Do\u201d Framework aka Asset/Customer Reuse Matrix : \n \n \nDiscussing Strategy at KEC Ventures with the founders and management of one of our startups in 2014. \n  \nSometimes people who are unaccustomed to thinking about strategy can become paralysed by the volumes of information they have to consider during the process of developing a strategy for an organization; a startup, a company, a corporation, or a division of a corporation. Any kind of organization can use a form of this framework to narrow down its choices. \n \nThe vertical axis represents assets or \u201d degree of asset reusability\u201d while the vertical axis represents customers or \u201cdegree of customer reusability\u201d. In the  diagram below I have used assets and customers respectively. One difference is that if I had labeled the axes \u201cdegree of asset reusability\u201d and \u201cdegree of customer reusability\u201d respectively then I would have also had to label them so that they go from \u201cHigh\u201d near the origin to \u201cLow\u201d as one moved farther from the origin along each axis. \n \nGenerally, activities in Quadrant 1 rely on assets that the startup already owns to create new products that the founders believe will be readily accepted and adopted by the startup\u2019s customers. Activities in this quadrant are comparatively \u201ceasy\u201d for the startup to execute. Activities in Quadrant 2 and Quadrant 4  are \u201ceasy\u201d along only one axis of the decision matrix, they are \u201chard\u201d or difficult along the other. In Quadrant 2 the startup has to find new customers, which is harder than selling to existing customers. However, it is relying on assets that it already owns, or can very easily obtain. In Quadrant 4 the startup is selling to its existing customers but it is using assets that it does not own, and cannot easily obtain. \n \nQuadrant 3 is the \u201cDo Not Fucking\u201d do that shit region; in this region the startup is developing a product using assets that it does not own, nor can easily obtain, to sell to customers that it does not already have, nor can easily obtain. In this region the startup\u2019s activities are hard along both dimensions of the decision matrix. \n \nAs the diagram illustrates the activities labelled A, B, C, and D should relatively easily be migrated from their respective originating quadrants once they are sufficiently mature. In the case of A & B, the new customers stick around long enough for the startup to develop a close and relatively durable bond with them.  We can go through a similar thought process for C & D. The key is for startup founders to figure out how to quickly move A, B, C and D into Quadrant 1 as quickly as possible. \n \nThe activities labelled E pose a tougher challenge. Generally it is best to avoid them at all cost. Pursuing those activities places the startup at risk of material and substantial loss. Any decision to pursue them requires careful analysis of what it will take to conduct the R&D required to develop the product, as well as estimates of the costs that have to be incurred in order to create demand and win new customers for that product and for the startup. Sometimes its just a matter of timing, but at other times the issues at play are more complex, creating an opaque environment that makes it difficult to make such assessments, and often making it difficult to move those activities into one of the other three available quadrants. DNFD does not mean \u201cdon\u2019t do that under any circumstance\u201d but rather \u201cyou better have a really good reason for doing that\u201d and so there are situations under which careful strategic analysis leads to one conclusion and one conclusion only . . . You better fucking do that or you\u2019ll get killed. We\u2019ll look at an example below. \n \n \nThe DNFD Strategy Framework \u2013 It is easiest to use existing assets to sell to existing customers. \n  \nBriefly: The DNFD Strategic Framework in Action \n  Should Apple produce a tablet?  Assume you were assessing Apple\u2019s strategic options soon after it became clear that the iPod/iPhone and iTunes/App Store were going to be wildly successful. How would you decide if it made sense to do more work determining if Apple should develop and market the iPad? Very quickly; first, people who buy iPods or iPhones are likely to want a tablet like the iPad for those activities they no longer enjoy engaging in on their laptop or desktop computers, and for which the customer experience on the iPod or the iPhone is unsatisfactory at best. Moreover, the organizational capabilities that Apple has acquired over the course of time as it has developed the iPod and iTunes, and then the iPhone and the App Store and brought those products to market are easily transferable to developing, producing, and marketing the iPad. 9  Should Facebook create its own games?  When Zynga announced that it was going to develop its own platform so that it did not depend solely on Facebook as a distribution channel for its games, some people might have immediately assumed that Facebook would rapidly start developing its own games to compete with its one-time partner turned rival, Zynga. The DNFD Framework would suggest that this is not so obvious, from the perspective of an outsider trying to assess the situation. However, one might have asked the following questions; Can Facebook easily reuse its accumulated organizational capabilities to publish games that go on to become immensely popular amongst Facebook\u2019s users? If  yes, would these games have a high degree of acceptance and adoption by Facebook\u2019s users? Next, what trade-offs would Facebook have to make in order to start developing its own games? As you can see, these questions are not so straightforward? For example, even though Zynga\u2019s games became immensely popular, one would have to ask how much, on average, of all user activity in a given year on Facebook was devoted by its users to Zynga\u2019s games? Was it significant, noteworthy, or miniscule? As of this writing Facebook has not made any moves to become a publisher of games like Zynga. However, it bought Oculus Rift, a virtual reality device company \u2013 it is not yet clear what that means for the prospects of Facebook/Oculus entering the game publishing business. I would not hold my breath if I were you.  Should Facebook build its own data centers?  It is late 2008 and youhave been asked to conduct an analysis on the subject: Facebook should build its own data centers; Yes or No? Your analysis will form the basis of the direction Facebook takes on this issue. What would your conclusion be?  What is Facebook?  What is Facebook\u2019s business?  Why should Facebook be concerned about building its own data centers? Think 5, 10, 15 years out.  Who is the customer? What are the assets? Will the customer readily and willingly adopt the product?  Can Facebook afford to fund the R&D and other costs associated with building its own data centers?  What are the opportunity costs that Facebook will confront if it does this?  What advantages will Facebook gain? What disadvantages will it face? Does one outweigh the other?     \nIn What Format Should A Strategic Plan Be Maintained? The goal of strategic planning is to create a map that guides the actions of the people in an organization. Good strategy is inextricably linked to execution, and operations. It is management\u2019s responsibility to ensure that strategy is understood to sufficient depth and detail, by everyone in an organization, within the context of the different roles and responsibilities that different people bear and fulfill. \n \nA strategic plan should cover: \n  Product   What features of the startup\u2019s product are critical for this stage of the startup\u2019s life cycle?  For example, what features should the minimum viable product include? What should it exclude? Why? 10    How is the startup going to identify its customers? Why do those customers buy the product? Why do those potential who do not buy the product make that choice? What will cause them to change their mind?  What features does the product need to have if it is going to help the startup win its market?  What does the landscape of features look like for competitive or substitute products within the startup\u2019s  market and Value Net, how should the product be positioned relative to that landscape? Why? What are the trade-offs resulting from those choices?      Finance   How will the startup increase revenues?  How will the startup reduce costs?    Operations \u2013 see related discussion in:  Why Tech Startups Can Gain Competitive Advantage from Operations   How will the startup get better at creating its products?  How will the startup get better at delivering its products to its customers?  How will the startup ensure that its operations infrastructure does not become obsolete?  How will the startup ensure that its operations become a source of sustainable competitive advantage and differentiate it from its competitors, while protecting and enhancing its current chosen position in its Value Net?  How will the startup ensure that its operations infrastructure do not lock it into a position that becomes competitively disadvantageous?    Growth   How will the startup gain new customers?  How will the startup strengthen its bonds with its existing customers?  How will the startup win back customers it has lost?  How will the startup expand into new markets?  What adjacent markets should the startup consider entering? What risks will it face in doing so?  What new geographic markets should the startup consider entering? Why? Why no?  What does the startup need to do in terms of marketing, sales, advertising and public relations as those activities relate to the startup\u2019s growth?    People   What does the startup need to do in order to attract and retain the best people it can find to help it accomplish its stated goals and objectives?  How should the startup develop the people on its existing team?  How does the startup motivate its people, and empower them to accomplish things they previously did not know or believe they could accomplish?     \nWhen I have collaborated with others in creating strategic plans in the past those plans started out as notes in my notebook. Then they migrated to notes in a word processor, and finally to a presentation deck that management could use to guide organization-wide conversation about overall strategy, as well as brief summaries, explanations, examples and ideas to help managers communicate the message down the organization. However, the most important work started at the front-lines; studying customers, talking to be people directly doing the work that leads to the creation, delivery and fulfillment of the organization\u2019s value proposition to its customers. That is where the real work of creating strategy occurs. \n \nA strategic plan should be readily and easily accessible to everyone in the organization, and should be updated as frequently as is necessary to suit the startup\u2019s goals and objectives. \n \nClosing Notes \n  This blog post has covered a lot of ground, not all of which is applicable to every startup at this moment. However, even a startup that is made up of two engineers developing the early versions of a software product needs to make choices regarding what they should build. That startup needs a strategy.  Strategy should not become stagnant once it has been developed, it should evolve and adapt to the changing circumstances that a startup finds itself in.  In thinking of a how startup develops a competitive advantage I am thinking of of how it combines the resources that it controls which help it search for a repeatable, scalable, and profitable business model. These resources might be tangible or intangible.  A related issue is how the startup influences its external environment and the factors that influence competition such that those factors do not cause it harm.  A startup has a competitive advantage when it is implementing a strategy and a business model that cannot simultaneously be implemented by its current or potential competitors. It has a sustainable competitive advantage when its strategy and business model cannot simultaneously be implemented by current or potential competitors, and when those competitors cannot duplicate the benefits of that strategy and business model. 11  The startup\u2019s culture is an important source of competitive advantage, and ought to work in concert with its strategy. For example, employees of Facebook should \u201cMove fast, and break things.\u201d within the tenets of its strategy. When Andy Grove \u201cLet chaos reign.\u201d at Intel he did so within the parameters of Intel\u2019s strategy. 12   \nFurther Reading : These notes are intended only as a starting point. Below some books that you should consider reading. \n   The Management Myth: Debunking Modern Business Philosophy  \u2013 Argues, not unreasonably, that there\u2019s no evidence that competitive advantage can be created in advance, and takes issue with Michael Porter\u2019s ideas about competitive advantage. Personally, I am less interested in arguments between academics, and more interested in understanding how people who need to run a business can get better at day-to-day, and long-term execution. The key is to get better at making sensible trade-offs in the present, in order to increase the odds of success in the future. No one can predict the future. Anyone who makes such a claim is a liar.  The End of Competitive Advantage: How to Keep Your Strategy Moving as Fast as Your Business  \u2013 Argues that Porter\u2019s ideas lead to a dangerous complacency; eventually creating the inertia that ensures that entrenched incumbents get displaced by nimble upstarts. In other words competitive advantage is transient, not permanent.  Playing to Win: How Strategy Really Works  \u2013 Practical examples of how to make strategic choices for people managing any kind of organization. Arms readers with a definition of strategy, the Strategy Choice Cascade, and the Strategic Structuring process.  Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters  \u2013 Departs from other books on strategy by focusing on a range of fundamental issues that have received little attention. It deals more with the day to day issues strategists must confront, and less with the conceptual arguments about competitive advantage. I wish it existed in 2008/2009 when I needed to translate what I had been taught in business school with real-world scenarios with which I had to contend. Hindsight analysis is easy, developing a forward-looking strategic plan that will work is more difficult. This book focusses on helping illuminate how you can get better at the latter.

It\u2019s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office late Saturday afternoon. \n \nThree hours later, U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in the Eastern District of New York heard arguments on behalf of two Iraqi men detained at JFK airport: Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who worked for the U.S. military in Iraq, and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, whose wife did the same and was granted a visa to join his wife and son already here on refugee status. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the ACLU, International Refugee Assistance Project, National Immigration Law Center, and The Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization argued in a filing on behalf of the two men, which was expanded to a class-action motion. \n \nThe filing says Darweesh, who was granted a special immigrant visa after threats to his life because of a decade of service to the U.S. military and contractors and was trying to travel to Charlotte, was detained in New York and when his attorneys asked Customs and Border Patrol \u201cwho is the person to talk to?\u201d about seeing their client the CBP agents responded, \u201cMr. President. Call Mr. Trump.\" \n \nDonnelly based her stay of Trump's order on \"strong likelihood of success in establishing that the removal of the petitioner and others similarly situated violates their rights to Due Process and Equal Protection guaranteed by the United States Constitution\" as well as \"imminent danger that, absent the stay of removal, there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject to the January 27, 2017 Executive Order.\" \n \nThere were two more federal cases: In Washington state, U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly ordered the government to not deport two unnamed people pending a Feb. 3 hearing. In U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Judge Leonie Brinkema blocked deportations of valid visa-holders for the next seven days and ordered that lawyers be granted access to \u201call legal permanent residents being detained at Dulles International Airport.\" \n \nActivists reported that hours after the order was issued, CBP still wasn't granting access to the Dulles detainees.

Next week three more Straits Times Index  (SGX: ^STI) companies will step into the spotlight. They are Hutchison Port Holdings  (SGX: NS8U), SIA Engineering Company  (SGX: S59) and StarHub  (SGX: CC3). \n\nProbably the most closely watched of the three companies could be Singapore\u2019s second-largest telecom operator, StarHub. In November, the company said it intends to maintain its annual dividend payment of S$0.20 per share, which could help to reassure shareholders. \n\nHowever, revenues are unlikely to have grown from last year, which under the constraints of a competitive landscape is hardly a disaster. That said, the company\u2019s outlook for the next 12 months could be crucial. \n\nA handful of Singapore midcaps are pencilled in for quarterly results too. They include property developers Wing Tai Holdings  (SGX: W05) and Fragrance Group  (SGX: F31). \n\nResults are also on tap from Singapore Post  (SGX: S08). The logistics firm reported a rise in revenues, which was driven primarily by growth in eCommerce. Continued improvement in this sector will be eyed, especially in terms of profitability, which is still lagging top-line growth. \n\nOn the economic front, the US Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest-rate decision on Wednesday. It will be first Fed meeting since Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the US. Currently, the market expects no change this month to the fed Fund rate. But it is also anticipating that it could lift the cost of borrowing as many as three times this year. \n\nJapan has an interest-rate decision to make too, as does the Bank of England. Chances are that the BoJ interest rates will keep rates at -0.01% and the long-term bond yield will be held at around zero percent. There are signs that the economy is starting to pick up, so the BoJ is unlikely to rock the boat too much. \n\nThe Bank of England is unlikely to do anything out of the ordinary, either. The bank base rate could be kept at 0.25%, while Quantitative could be maintained at £435 billion. The level of UK interest rates appears to be at odds with the rate of inflation though, which stood at 1.6% last month. \n\nDespite the long Spring holiday break in China the country will still be reporting the closely-watched manufacturing and services PMI figures. As always, any number above 50 will signal expansion, which should please the market. \n\nThe Motley Fool's purpose is to help the world invest, better.

Only 121 survived, with 354 dying at sea.\n\nIt had made an unscheduled stop at Buncrana and set off again when it was struck by the mines just off Lough Swilly. It only took around 20 minutes for the ship to go down.\n\nAs well as carrying hundreds of passengers, it was carrying an estimated 43 tonnes of gold ingots at the time of its sinking, around £300 million worth.\n\nLocal fishermen managed to rescue the survivors, although many who\u2019d made it to the lifeboats had died due to extreme cold weather that evening.\n\nThe passenger boat had been converted into an armed merchant cruiser during the war, and had been operated by White Star Line, the company most famous for its ill-fated Titanic.\n\nIrish victims\n\nOne crew member was Irishman Martin Moloney, who had joined the British Navy around the outbreak of World War One.\n\nHis great granddaughter, Anne Clarke, told TheJournal.ie that Martin has always been a source of pride for the family, ahead of events this weekend.\n\nShe said: \u201cHe was one of the unlucky ones. My father would always tell stories about him. The ship had set off bound for Canada to bring soldiers home, but stopped off at Buncrana after members of the crew fell ill with yellow fever.\u201d\n\nThe ship stopped briefly in Buncrana, while some of the sick seafarers exited and received treatment.\n\nThe SS Laurentis \n\nThere had been reports of U-Boats in the area, and the SS Laurentis was only a couple of hours from Buncrana when it hit the mine.\n\nOne of the mines hit the engine room, cutting power to the ship. This made it difficult for crew to quickly lower the lifeboats or for the ship to issue a distress call.\n\n\u201cIt was bitterly cold that night,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cA lot of the men who made it onto lifeboats didn\u2019t survive long enough to be found.\u201d\n\nWhile 354 in total lost their lives, the Captain managed to make survive despite being the last to leave the ship.\n\nAfterwards, he was quoted in the New York Times: \u201cThe officers and men lived up to the best traditions of the navy\u2026The deaths were all due to exposure, owing to the coldness of the night.\n\nRumours around the lost treasure trove of gold persisted for many years, with divers plunging the depths to try and recover the gold. There are still 22 gold bars yet to be recovered, at the bottom of the sea at Lough Swilly.\n\nIt is believed that the gold was intended to help fund the British war effort, by purchasing munitions from the USA which had not yet joined the Allies.\n\nPaying tribute\n\nRonan McConnell, education officer with Derry City and Strabane District Council, told Highland Radio that the Mayor of Derry would welcome people in for lunch at Guildhall just as the Mayor did for survivors of the tragedy at the time, to commemorate the anniversary.\n\n\u201cThe survivors were treated very well by the people of the North-West in general,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nThe survivors posed with the Mayor for a picture at the time, and this was recreated at the lunch event during the week.\n\nHistoric lunch for survivors of Laurentic sank 1917 recreated in#guildhall #derry 354 drowned & 43 tonnes of gold at bottom of lough swilly pic.twitter.com/J4uC96lKLC\n\n\u2014 EileenMagnier (@EileenMagnier) January 27, 2017 Source: EileenMagnier/Twitter\n\nHe also called on the public to come forward with any artifacts or mementos from the time. \u201dMany have come forward with stories to go along with these artifacts,\u201d he added.\n\nOne man from Buncrana had come forward with a brass knocker which was purportedly from the captain\u2019s quarters on the ship.\n\nThis man\u2019s grandfather had been a handyman in Buncrana. He was among some men brought on board when the ship originally docked, and the captain told him \u201cIt might be better hanging on your door than at the bottom of the sea,\u201d a statement which turned out to be quite prophetic.\n\nCrana College also marked the anniversary, with transition year students learning about the tragedy and making a video on what they learned.\n\nVideo (http://www.youtube.com/watch=82oonW4dSeU&t=) Source: Kevin Cooley/YouTube \n\nBBC Radio Foyle paid this tribute on the centenary, with the \u201cLaurentic Lament\u201d playing in the background.\n\nDerry\u2019s Tower Museum is hosting a free exhibition on the ship, which will last until June this year.\n\nRelatives of those who\u2019d been on the ship, particularly from Canada, attended the launch of the exhibition this week.\n\nThe Laurentic exhibition opened last night at the Tower museum in Derry.\n\nWell worth a visit. pic.twitter.com/XW5feBGmJa\n\n\u2014 Ulster Canada (@LaurenticConf) January 26, 2017 Source: Ulster Canada/Twitter","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Murray"},"topics":[{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Ireland news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"100 years on, victims of naval vessel which sank off Donegal remembered","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"IE","country":"Ireland"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"TheJournal.ie","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"175383370","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"286"},"name":"TheJournal.ie","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thejournal.ie"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.highlandradio.com/2017/01/19/laurentic-commemorations-planned-as-100th-anniversary-approaches/","https://twitter.com/hashtag/derry?src=hash","https://t.co/J4uC96lKLC","https://twitter.com/EileenMagnier/status/824978792779304962","https://twitter.com/EileenMagnier","https://www.youtube.com/user/kevtr1","http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04qvn55","http://www.derrystrabane.com/towermuseum","https://t.co/XW5feBGmJa","https://twitter.com/LaurenticConf/status/824543145270599680","https://twitter.com/LaurenticConf","http://www.youtube.com/watch=82oonW4dSeU&t="],"sequenceId":"695194764991","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://img2.thejournal.ie/article/3206585/river/?height=400&version=3206730"}],"video":[]}}

But it's not clear the measures will help prevent attacks on American soil, and they could wind up emboldening extremists who already view the U.S. as at war with Islam.\n\nRecent acts of deadly extremist violence have been carried out either by U.S. citizens or by individuals whose families weren't from the nations singled out. And the list of countries in Trump's order doesn't include Saudi Arabia, where most of the September 11 hijackers were from, or other places with a more direct link to terrorism in America.\n\nThe admissions ban announced Friday also does not directly address a more urgent law enforcement concern: homegrown violent extremists already in the United States who plot their attacks without any overseas connections or contacts.\n\n\"The primary terrorism-related threat facing the U.S. today comes from individuals living here who become inspired by what they see on the internet, who carry out attacks independent of any terrorist organization,\" said John Cohen, a former Department of Homeland Security counter-terrorism official who worked in government under Democratic and Republican administrations and who has been involved in refugee vetting policy.\n\nThe FBI has for years been concerned by the prospect of airplane bomb plots and terrorists dispatched from overseas to commit violence in America. But the ascendancy of the Islamic State, and the group's ability through slick and easily accessible propaganda to reach susceptible young Americans in all corners of the country, has been a more immediate challenge - and a more realistic danger - for counterterrorism officials than any threat posed by refugees from abroad.\n\n\"Dealing with that threat should be a top priority for this administration,\" Cohen said.\n\nThe executive order suspends refugee admissions for 120 days and bars all immigration for 90 days from Muslim-majority countries with terrorism concerns: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nIt indefinitely bars the processing of refugees from Syria, a country that's been of particular country to the FBI even though the number of Americans who have looked to travel there to fight with the Islamic State has been dwindling.\n\nBut the culprits of recent deadly terror attacks aren't linked to the countries singled out by Trump's order.\n\nOmar Mateen, the man responsible for the Orlando nightclub shooting, the deadliest terror attack in the U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks, was born in New York to Afghan parents.\n\nSyed Rizwan Farook, who took part in the December 2015 San Bernardino attack, was born in Chicago. His wife, Tashfeen Malik, had been living in Pakistan and visiting family in Saudi Arabia before she passed the background check and entered the U.S.\n\nThe brothers who bombed the Boston Marathon were ethnic Chechens who had been living in the U.S.\n\nIn general, Islamic extremists have accounted for a minuscule amount of the roughly 240,000 murders since Sept. 11, 2001, said Charles Kurzman, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nKurzman said his research identified zero fatalities since Sept. 11 caused by extremists from the seven nations in Trump's order. He said people with ancestry from those countries have accounted for only a small fraction of extremist-related arrests and disrupted plots during the same time period.\n\n\"I can only conclude that this is whipping up fear and hostility toward Americans who have family background from these countries,\" Kurzman said.\n\nStill, while refugees are subject to screening - including in-person interviews, checks with law enforcement databases and collection of biometric data, when available - the process is not perfect.\n\nFBI counterterrorism officials have long expressed concern about the lack of background information about refugees from Syria, a home base of the Islamic State, and Director James Comey has said that he could not guarantee a mistake-free vetting process.\n\nThere have been isolated incidents of refugees later accused in terror-related plots.\n\nAn Iraqi refugee who entered the U.S. in 2009, for instance, pleaded guilty in Houston in October to attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State. Two Iraqi refugees who lived in Kentucky are now in prison after having been convicted in a plot to send sniper rifles, Stinger missiles and money to al-Qaida operatives waging an insurgency back home.\n\nAnd the man accused in the November car-and-knife that injured 11 people at Ohio State University was a refugee originally from Somalia who, as an adolescent, moved with his family to the United States in 2014 after living in Pakistan.\n\nThough not immune from lapses, the screening process has improved over the years, Cohen said. He said he was concerned that the refugee ban could deter Muslim-majority countries from cooperating with the U.S. on policy matters and could embolden an extremist already bent on violence.\n\n\"That's something,\" Cohen said, \"that law enforcement folks are going to be factoring into their violence prevention efforts.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Deccan Chronicle"},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump shuts door on refugees, but will the US...","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dotemirates.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"609646081","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Dotemirates.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dotemirates.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194768824","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:45Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://dotemirates.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/2017/01/abbc15ca4259dbe3b7d432fca5bd6328.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The bathroom was dirty and shabby. We had to request pillows and even a spoon for our tea tray. The room never even had a chair. If we had not arranged to meet friends at an evening dinner and the city of culture celebrations the next day, we would have left demanding our money back.\"\n\nLocation: Anlaby Road, Hull\n\nCall: 01482 323299\n\nVisit: www.gilsonhotel.co.uk \n\nRating: 3 out of 5\n\nWhat reviewers say: \"My husband and I have stayed at this hotel on many occasions over the last five years and I can honestly say the facilities have really gone down hill. Unfortunately, the cost of staying there has also gone up, at one point being quoted £84 which is excessive for what you get.\"\n\n\"I stayed here after struggling to find vacancies in Hull and thought it looked quite nice driving into the complex when I arrived after a busy day. The receptionist was nice but in a rush to go home and for me to leave the bar after one drink at 9pm. I was able to have another drink if I took it to the room. When I got to the room, it smelled strongly of stale cigarette smoke, bedding appeared clean but the rest of the room dirty and carpets sticky and filthy. Unusual key system left me unsure if the door was locked and when I tried to ring to ask for advice and explain about cigarette smell, the staff had gone home and no answer. I then checked reviews which said this was a well-known hot spot for sex trade! I hadn't yet tried the shower but looking at other reviews I hope it works and hope my clothes don't smell too much of smoke at work tomorrow. I paid £59 to stay here without breakfast. Will not be staying again!\"\n\nLocation: Beverley Road, Hull\n\nCall: 01482 325530\n\nWebsite: www.campanile.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"The best hotels in Hull on TripAdvisor - and two that get less flattering reviews","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"East Riding of Yorkshire","zipCode":"HU3","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Kingston upon Hull, City of","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Hull Daily Mail","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"369155276","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"406"},"name":"Hull Daily Mail","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://hulldailymail.co.uk","publisher":"Local World"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.premierinn.com/","http://www.kingstontheatrehotel.com/","http://www.village-hotels.co.uk/","http://www.ihg.com/","http://www.travelodge.co.uk/","http://www.accorhotels.com/","http://www.mercure.com/","http://www.innkeeperslodge.com/","http://www.trinityhull.co.uk/","http://www.gilsonhotel.co.uk/","http://www.campanile.com/"],"sequenceId":"695194769016","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/images/localworld/ugc-images/276270/Article/images/30092183/15825420.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The decision has been appealed to An Bord Pleanala who he hopes will look \u201cmore favourably\u201d on the project at Bohereen, Donoughmore. \n \n\n \n\u201cIt is a very unsatisfactory situation. I was appointed parish priest in 2014, I have been living in rented accommodation outside the parish since then. Being a priest it is nice to be in the parish and nice for people to have you in the parish,\u201d said Fr Mangan, who is originally from Ardagh. There are three churches, three schools and around 1,200 living in the parish. \n \nLocals feel so strongly about the ongoing situation that they organised a skydive, which Fr Mangan took part in, to raise money for the house last year. \n \n\u201cIt was built in 1904 but it has a lot of problems with wet rot and dry rot and would not be healthy to live in.\u201d said Fr Mangan. In planning documents, he says it is structurally unsafe; in a deplorable condition throughout; unfit for purpose because of its scale, size and layout; economically not suitable for restoration; health and safety risk and subject to anti-social behaviour. \n \nThe plan is to knock it and build a smaller type abode but use some of the stonework from the old house \u201cto make the connection between the old and the new\u201d. A coach house is to be retained. The parochial house was removed from the record of protected structures by a unanimous decision by elected members of the metropolitan area in November. \n \nPlanning was refused by the council because, \u201cIn the absence of sufficient evidence submitted on file to date with regard to the suitability of the site for the safe disposal of domestic effluent treatment, it is considered that the proposed development, if permitted, would be prejudicial to public health and would seriously endanger the health and safety of person occupying the structure\u201d. \n \nIt also states that the County Development Plan contains a general presumption against the demolition of habitable dwellings\u2026 where it aims to promote rehabilitation of existing buildings, over demolition. \n \nThe refusal goes on to say the structure is listed on the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage therefore \u201cthis proposal  for the demolition of a habitable house is contrary to objectives of the County Development Plan and would set an undesirable precedent for the future preservation of such buildings in the county\u201d. \n \nFr Mangan argues that it would cost a lot more money to do up the house and maintain it than knocking it and building a smaller one with modern insulation but \u201crespects the planning people as well\u201d.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Limerick priest in limbo after planning refused for parochial house","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"IE","country":"Ireland"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Limerick Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169816942","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"Limerick Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.limerickleader.ie"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194769734","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Aussies think it's great because it's a win win for them.\" \n \nCahill said there was little compassion in the Australian policy, which sent back everyone no matter what their offence. \n \n\"It might be one thing when you've got someone that has committed an armed robbery sitting in jail. It's different when you've got someone who has lived their whole life there and been convicted of a relatively minor offence.\" \n \nTony Touri, 48, landed in Christchurch before Christmas, after stints in jail and an Australian immigration detention centre. \n \nHe left behind his family, a $2000-a-week job and the kickboxing club where he helped train youth. \n \nTouri saw Christchurch as a fresh start with labouring opportunities and a place free from old North Island gang connections. \n \n\"It turned my life upside down. When I arrived here, I felt like an alien.\" \n \nCahill said it had been well proven through released prisoners, that if supports were not in place, the risk of reoffending was greater. \n \n\"These people are sort of similar but there isn't the same support available to follow up with them all the time, so it doesn't surprise me we're getting that 30 per cent reoffending,\" he said. \n \nThe Canterbury branch of Pars has found growing demand for their support service. \n \n\"We could have one in a month. We could get roughly one a week, then two in one week,\" Murphy said. \n \nIn 2014, Pars settled just three people in Christchurch. That figure rose to 15 in 2015 and to 51 in 2016. \n \nFive women were among the group that had arrived since 2014. \n \nCounties Manukau District has the highest population of deportees, with 118 residing in the area.  \n \nAuckland City has attracted 89, while 69 people are listed in Canterbury.  \n \nWellington has 52 returning offenders and 51 are in the Waitemata District. \n \nCorrections deputy national commissioner Rachel Leota\u200b said the provision of effective reintegration services for returning offenders was important because many did not have strong links to New Zealand.  \n \nCorrections budgeted $300,000 a year for five years for providers such as Pars to help returning offenders settle back into life in New Zealand.  \n \nPrior to entering a contract with the Corrections in 2016, Pars received $77,000 from the Christchurch City Council to support deportees. \n \nCahill said before an information sharing agreement with Australian authorities was signed in September 2015, police were lucky to get a few hours notice of new arrivals.  \n \n\"Whereas now we are able to prepare a little and have staff meet them.\" \n \nHigh-risk offenders are visited by police 48 hours after arrival. \n \n\"It's good in theory but there simply aren't the resources to do that. And there are no controls,\" Cahill said. \n \nHe said in some cases in Auckland, returning offenders had checked out of supported living arrangements or motels before police arrived for their checkup.  \n \n\"They're not breaking the law per se when they do that, because a lot of them aren't under any restrictions. They're just into the wind.\" \n \n  \n      Comments","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"EMILY SPINK"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"New Zealand news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Deportees stretching resources","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"The Press NZ","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"189987471","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"The Press NZ","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194769927","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It was a miracle that no one was injured or killed. It was a miracle that time, and traffic, literally, stood still, at what otherwise was quite possibly the worst moment for traffic. It was a miracle enveloping an act of utter rashness that I engineered, and take the blame for, and of the hapless innocence of another. \n \nI will relive it for some time to come, as will, no doubt, a fellow from Stonington I happen to know, who also witnessed this miracle with a look of unblinking dismay and disbelief on his face, not to mention abject paralysis. \n \nMy friend, Lenny, who lives in Clinton, Conn., was coming up to meet me for lunch. He\u2019s a tennis buddy \u2014 we\u2019ve played together for years at the Old Saybrook Racquet Club. We also enjoy the occasional cigar and usually meet for lunch in downtown New London, sort of halfway for each of us, and repair to the comfy upstairs cigar lounge at Thames River Greenery on State Street after we eat. \n   \nFrom this section: \nLetter: St. Pius X School moving to next level as St. Pius X Regional Academy \n  \nThe Greenery was closed last week with the owners on vacation in France, so Lenny agreed to drive a few more miles to Westerly, which, since last year, has touted Vintage Cigar Lounge & Club on High Street as among its downtown dens of civility. \n \nFor lunch, I suggested Mia\u2019s Prime Time Café on the bridge between Pawcatuck and Westerly, because I like it, and for someone not familiar with downtown, it is relatively easy to locate and the view, from the tables by the windows, of the Pawcatuck River lazing by is charming. Technically, of course, Mia\u2019s, at 1 West Broad St., is in Pawcatuck, not Westerly, but dining on such a scenic border between states adds to the allure. \n \nThe one problem, as often as not, is parking. Locals know how to negotiate the dicey two-way thoroughfare on the bridge and seek out a spot, or a place close by. For someone from away, it might be rather more intimidating. I told Lenny I would be waiting in front of Mia\u2019s to help guide him. \n \nHe managed to find a spot, snuggled in behind a pickup truck along the bridge, where there are maybe four or five legitimate spaces en route into Westerly. Lenny\u2019s car was, to my eye, a bit close to the truck, leaving little space for the truck to back out. Lenny said he was OK with it, but I asked him, for my peace of mind, to move to another spot. There was a prime one where I was standing in front of the café. He first tried to fit into a narrow space ahead on the bridge, as the road began to curve, but his car was outside the white line setting off the spaces. I urged him to take the one where I was, which meant heading back toward Pawcatuck. \n \n\u201cJust go around and come here,\u201d I said to him, gesturing up ahead. What I failed to say, not realizing he was new to the traffic patterns and terrain, was \u201cgo around the whole block,\u201d meaning merging with the traffic flow past the Washington Trust Company building on at the corner of Broad and Main streets, going left up Union Street toward the Westerly Fire Department, taking a left in front of the Westerly Library, and then following Broad Street past Dixon Square back to the bridge and Mia\u2019s. \n \nInstead, Lenny, raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., and confident in city traffic, did the unthinkable. He presumed I meant going around the pedestrian island at Main and Broad streets opposite the bank, where, as those who observed this maneuver understood as we stared in dread, all traffic is one-way, going dead against Lenny\u2019s turn, and much of it coming blind around the bank\u2019s corner to whatever is ahead. In Lenny\u2019s defense, there is no \u201cone-way\u201d sign posted there. He had no idea, obviously, of how fraught with danger his left turn was. \n \nFor whatever merciful reason, especially at that hectic time of day \u2014 noon \u2014 Lenny executed the turn without a car, truck, bus or vehicle of any sort moving toward him in his path. \n \nAs the fellow (I will call him Pete because his name is Pete) who had been walking through that intersection and stopped, on the sidewalk along the south side of the bridge to watch, helpless to do anything but gape and pray, said later: \u201cSomeone very special must have been watching over downtown Westerly at midday. PHEW.\u201d \n \nPhew, indeed. As a balm, I suppose, we were able to enjoy our lunch, and then our leisurely cigar, and finally a walk back through Wilcox Park. But I still see it, that awful moment, and giggle nervously over the absolute wonder that nothing happened. I can\u2019t shake it, and, being responsible for it, I write about it, since, after the fact, it is true, that\u2019s about all I\u2019m able to do. \n \nSteven Slosberg lives in Stonington.

In common parlance, an object\u2019s size and shape referred to its dimensions. In science fiction and New Age philosophy, a dimension can also refer to a different plane of existence.

We can also combine these movements, moving forward and to the right to move in a northeasterly direction. The fourth dimension is time. Unlike the other three dimensions, where you can move in any direction, time seems to move in only one direction. However, scientists studying chaos theory and other high-level physics problems believe that time can be moved into directions. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t know how this is done yet. In mathematics, dimensions become a coordinate system. This has been put to practical use in the measures of latitude and longitude found on Earth.

I am like any other woman, I'll scoff a few chocolates and then I'll think, 'Ooh, I'd better keep an eye on that.'

And Small Business Saturday was a busy day, said David Borlaug, president of the Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation, which runs the gallery. \n\n\"In spite of the bad weather, in terms of original art, sales have been great,\" he said. \"It validates Bismarck was ready for this kind of gallery.\" \n\nBorlaug said Bismarck has been \"blessed\" with a multitude of galleries, each with a different niche. Bismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative, Bismarck Art & Galleries Association and Gallery 522 all feature member artists' works. There's also Art Gallerie on Main, where Lydia Richez-Bowman features her own work and that of several other local artists, as well as teaching classes. \n\nBorlaug said Capital Gallery is focused on featuring two artists on its walls \u2014 one expressive and one traditional \u2014 along with several others who work in various other media, such as glass or bronze. The gallery sets itself apart by limiting the number of artists and featuring them for longer periods. And because it does not cater to member artists, \"the world's our oyster,\" he said. \n\nBorlaug has artists lined up for the foreseeable future, with Deane Collin Fay of Gackle alongside Bismarck native Vern Erickson's western Americana pieces coming up in Februarym The Bismarck Tribune (http://bit.ly/2joTPY3 ) reports. \n\n\"There is a thriving art culture in Bismarck,\" Borlaug said. \"We're just glad to be part of it.\" \n\nHe points to Jessica Wachter as an up-and-coming Bismarck artist who has a \"real following across the country,\" with works featured in galleries in Los Angeles and Scottsdale, Ariz. \n\nStephanie Delmore of Gallery 522 agrees. \n\n\"I think we're just getting to that point of there being enough galleries\" that they could partner on events, like gallery hops, she said. \"We can start to thread ourselves together.\" \n\nAs Bismarck's population has become more diverse, Delmore said there are more people who are used to going to galleries on a regular basis. \n\n\"I think the traffic is picking up,\" she said, with the public understanding what art adds to a community. \n\nSince starting 32 years ago, Gallery 522 has wanted all local artists to be able to show their work daily rather than wait five years for their turn at a larger show. \n\n\"We've always meant to be of service to artists,\" Delmore said, and on a day-to-day basis, the gallery has a multitude of artists covering its walls. \n\nBismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative works much the same way, though with slightly different rules and organization, while BAGA has become more well-known for hosting larger shows for its member artists, Delmore said. \n\n\"I think we've got a lovely base of artists in the area,\" she said, and having more galleries showcasing those artists could result in more art-focused events come spring. \n\nBorlaug said he thinks Bismarck is where Fargo was a couple decades ago in terms of growing from a big town to a small city \u2014 and art \"makes cities.\" \n\n\"I feel Bismarck is more than ready to grow its arts community,\" he said. \n\nIn turn, that community could help grow the city, attracting more residents. Borlaug said one of the first things people want to know about before moving somewhere is the arts scene: Is there a symphony? An orchestra? Visual arts? \n\n\"It could help get people to move here,\" he said, and the art produced here is helping tell this area's story. \n\n--- \n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com \n\nAP Member Exchange shared by The Bismarck Tribune.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JESSICA HOLDMANThe Bismarck Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: celebrity gossip","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Number of art galleries increases for Bismarck","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fayette","zipCode":"40507","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lexington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Kentucky.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658700","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4463"},"name":"Kentucky.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Gossip","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kentucky.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2joTPY3","http://www.bismarcktribune.com/"],"sequenceId":"695194786013","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Multiple female filmmakers nabbed top prizes, while a tale of a woman re-asserting control over her life scored the festival's highest honor.\n\nMacon Blair's \"I Don't Feel At Home In This World Anymore,\" in which Melanie Lynskey plays an ordinary woman who becomes empowered as a detective-avenger after she is robbed, won the U.S. grand jury prize in the dramatic category. To its fans, the genre-tinged film, which Netflix will release next month, serves as a tonic to the perceived anti-female policies of the current administration.\n\nAnd Eliza Hittman's gay coming-of-age story \"Beach Rats\"\u200e won the directing award for the U.S. dramatic section--ensuring that a gathering that began with a march down this city's Main \u200eStreet championing feminist values closed out with the same motif.\n\n\"There's nothing more taboo in this country than a woman with ambition,\" Hittman said in her acceptance speech. \"I'm going to work my way through a system that's completely discriminatory toward women. Hollywood, I'm coming for you,\" she finished to loud cheers.\n\nHittman joined \"Step\u2019s\" Amanda Lipitz, \"Winnie\u2019s\" Pascale Lamche and \"Novitiate\u2019s\" Maggie Betts as female filmmakers receiving top honors Saturday night, among others.\n\nMeanwhile, \u200ea pair of issue-oriented movies took the top two audience prizes in U.S. sections.\u200e Matt Ruskin's wrongfully imprisoned tale \"Crown Heights,\" about a real-life Trinidadian immigrant who fought for 20 years to exonerate his friend, took the audience award in the us dramatic section, while \"Chasing \u200eCoral,\" Jeff Orlowski's environmentally-oriented story about a disappearing natural resource won for documentary. \n\n\"Can we have a shout-out to science?\" Orlowski said, accepting the prize, adding \"Climate change and science shouldn't be political.\"\n\nMeanwhile in U.S. documentary, \"Dina,\" Dan Sickles' and Antonio Santini's unconventional love story, won the grand jury prize.\u200e Joe Piscatella\u200e's \"Joshua: Teenager vs. Superpower,\" about a teenage dissident in Hong Kong\u200e, won the audience award in world doc.\n\nSundance awards can bestow a kind of pixie dust on films; three years ago, \"Whiplash\" won both U.S. jury and audience awards and went on to break out in the awards season that followed.\n\nB\u200eut currency in Utah doesn't always translate outside the fest bubble. Last year's double-winner \"The Birth of a Nation\" and 2015's twofer title-holder \"Me, Earl & The Dying Girl\" both sputtered, for different reasons, when released commercially. This marked the first time in five years that jury and audience prizes did not go to the same \u200efilm in the U.S. dramatic category.\n\nThe Trump executive order banning many visitors fro\u200em Muslim-heavy countries also came up repeatedly at the ceremony Saturday night, held at an event space about five miles away from the festival's hub.\n\nAt the podium, Sundance Institute chief Keri Putnam saluted the \"artists and subjects from Muslim-majority countries who joined us at this year's festival.\"\n\nShe continued, to a standing ovation, \"Closing our borders to these and other international artists will stop the flow of ideas and inspiration that are so vital to the global community. We stand with you and we stand with all people risking their lives for our values or seeking refuge from persecution.\"\n\nWinners also invoked the issue.\u200e World doc grand jury prize went to Feras Fayyad and Steen Johannessen's Syria-themed \"Last Men in Aleppo\"; the former made a plea to people in the U.S. to help fight for the rights of Syrians, noting a need for \"freedom and justice.\"\n\n\u200eLater, the grand jury prize for world cinema dramatic went to the Egypt-set \"The Nile Hilton Incident,\" a detective story set against the backdrop of the Arab \u200eSpring from director Tarik Saleh \u2014 who told a story about a security agent at LAX who allowed him to board the plane to Sundance despite the director forgetting his passport at a hotel.\n\n\"It wasn't the majority that voted for [Trump],\u201d Saleh said. \u201cI just want to say that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, accepting a cinematographer prize for his doc about a textile factory in India, \"Machines\" director Rahul Jain noted, \"The smell at the detention center at the airport. It's not fun. You feel like a rat. You feel like you smell for something you didn't do. Now many people are going to have to smell the smell of fear,\" he added.\n\nThroughout much of the night, statements about the Muslim ban shared the spotlight with feminist issues.\n\n\"Step,\" Lipitz's doc examination of the senior class at an all-girls charter school in an African-American section of Baltimore, won a special\u200e jury prize for inspirational filmmaking. \n\n\"Being a young woman today isn't easy,\" Lipitz said. \"These girls show nothing is impossible when you surround yourself with a group of powerful women. So let's keep doing that.\u200e\"\n\nEarlier, accepting the world documentary prize for director, \"Winnie\" helmer Lamche noted that \"for those who know, history is not made by great men.\" A story of unheralded women of a different sort is told in the period convent drama \"Novitiate,\" for which Betts won a special prize for breakthrough director in U.S. dramatic.\n\n\u200eAnd the comedic performer Jessica Williams, who hosted the ceremony, paired Trump and feminism when she quipped, \"The Audience award--when you think about the election\u200e, that's sort of the award that Hillary Clinton won\u200e.\"\n\n\"Gook,\" Justin Chon's story set against the backdrop of the 1992 L.A. riots, won the Next audience prize; he accepted by embracing concrete action on diversity. \"To me a lot of times it's been just talk,\" he said. \"The most effective way I can make a difference is to create\u200e.\"\n\nAs many directors offered political statements, festival director John Cooper suggested a lesson for beyond the fest.\n\n\u200e\"Let's take this into the future as we head off the mountain,\" he said. \"Our strength is in our number and our power is in our ideas.\" \n\nBut the most stirring speech of the night came from\u200e Yance Ford, director of the criminal-justice doc \"Strong Island,\" which won a special jury prize for storytelling in U.S. documentary.\n\nFord, whose movie examines the killing of his brother and the injustice that followed, cited Elie Wiesel's line that \"Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim,\" then said:\n\n\"That moment is now. When we leave this place we must interfere, disrupt, document and prevent our nation from folding in upon itself,\" he told the film community, both inside the room and outside of it. \"Summon your courage. Gather your cameras.\"\n\nHere is the complete list of winners: Grand Jury Prize: \u201cI Don\u2019t Feel At Home In This World Anymore.\u201d\n\nAudience Award: \u201cCrown Heights\u201d\n\nDirecting: Eliza Hittman, \u201cBeach Rats\u201d\n\nWaldo Salt Screenwriting Award: Matt Spicer and David Branson Smith, \u201cIngrid Goes West\u201d\n\nSpecial Jury Award for Breakthrough Performance: Chanté Adams, \u201cRoxanne Roxanne\u201d Special Jury Award for Breakthrough Director: Maggie Betts, \u201cNovitiate\u201d Special Jury Award for Cinematography: Daniel Landin, \u201cYellow Birds\u201d Grand Jury Prize: \u201cDina\u201d\n\nDirecting: Peter Nicks, \u201cThe Force\u201d\n\nOrwell Award: \u201cIcarus\u201d\n\nAudience Award: \u201cChasing Coral\u201d\n\nSpecial Jury Award for Editing: Kim Roberts and Emiliano Battista, \u201cUnrest\u201d Special Jury Award for Editing: Kim Roberts and Emiliano Battista, \u201cUnrest\u201d Special Jury Award for Storytelling: Yance Ford, \u201cStrong Island\u201d Special Jury Award for Inspirational Filmmaking: Amanda Lipitz, \u201cStep\u201d Grand Jury Prize: \u201cThe Nile Hilton Incident\u201d\n\nAudience Award: \u201cI Dream in Another Language\u201d\n\nDirecting Award: Francis Lee, \u201cGod\u2019s Own Country\u201d\n\nScreenwriting: Kirsten Tan, \u201cPop Aye\u201d\n\nSpecial Jury Award for Cinematic Visions: Jun Geng, \u201cFree and Easy\u201d Special Jury Award for Cinematography: Manu Dacosse, \u201cAxolotl Overkill\u201d Grand Jury Prize: \u201cLast Men in Aleppo\u201d\n\nAudience Award: \u201cJoshua: Teenager vs. Superpower\u201d\n\nDirecting Award: Pascale Lamche, \u201cWinnie\u201d\n\nSpecial Jury Award for Masterful Storytelling: Catherine Bainbridge, Alfonso Maiorana, \u201cRumble: The Indians Who Rocked the World\u201d Special Jury Award for Editing: Ramona S.

One spoke of reclaiming national pride, while the other hailed the benefits of free trade and international cooperation. Coming just four days apart, the speeches by Donald Trump and Xi Jinping could hardly have been more different. \n \nTrump was addressing a crowd at his inauguration as president in Washington. The Chinese president delivered his speech in the ski resort of Davos, Switzerland, at a gathering of some of the most influential people in the world. With China -- a nation that bars any major foreign investment in its \"sensitive\" industries -- advocating for global free trade, the contrast was striking. \n \nDOOM AND GLOOM \"From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land,\" a newly inaugurated Trump proclaimed on Jan. 20. \"From this day forward, it's going to be only America first.\" \n \nIn the run-up to the event, British bookmaker Ladbrokes took bets on which exact words the new commander-in-chief would use in his inaugural speech. ISIS, China, Russia, Japan and Asia seemed like safe bets. \n \nIn his 18-minute address, he said none of those words. Instead, it was an unmistakably inward-looking, divisive, populist speech that quickly dissolved any hopes that Trump would tone down his rhetoric once in office. \n \nHe used the word \"sad,\" a taboo phrase in traditional political speechwriting, and described the suffering of poor American families as \"carnage.\" The light rain that started to fall during the event only added to the somber tone. \n   \nSatohiro Akimoto, head of strategic consultancy Washington Insights, was struck by the difference between this address and the victory speech Trump gave on election night last November. \"This time, he said nothing to heal the rifts in the country or to make peace with his opponents. He distanced himself from both the Democratic Party and his own Republican Party. He criticized everyone in Washington.\" \n \nPOETIC APPROACH Some 6,700km away, in the Swiss mountains, Xi surprised the world in a different way, addressing the World Economic Forum on Jan. 17 with an eloquent speech that quoted traditional Chinese sayings, English writer Charles Dickens and the founder of the Red Cross, Henry Dunant. \n \nWhile Xi's 50-minute address contained little new policy, the symbolism, the timing and the words he chose to describe how his country views the world were striking. Here was a leader eager to fill whatever power vacuum the new U.S. president was going to leave. \n \n\"Honey melons hang on bitter vines; sweet dates grow on thistles and thorns. In a philosophical sense, nothing is perfect in the world,\" Xi told his audience. \"One would fail to see the full picture if he claims something is perfect because of its merits, or if he views something as useless just because of its defects. It is true that economic globalization has created new problems, but this is no justification to write economic globalization off completely.\" \n \nThe poetic language suggested that Xi had added a new speechwriter to his usual close-knit staff of party elites. \n \nHe also talked about China's own reservations about economic globalism and its hesitation about joining the World Trade Organization. China eventually joined the WTO in 2001, and it \"has proved to be a right strategic choice,\" he said. Today, exports make up 22% of China's GDP, significantly higher than the 4.3% it was in 1960. Trade is crucial to the Communist Party's political survival. \n \nIn a swipe at Trump, Xi said: \"Pursuing protectionism is like locking oneself in a dark room. While wind and rain may be kept outside, that dark room will also block light and air. No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war.\" \n \nThe Chinese government and the WEF began discussing Xi's possible attendance at Davos sometime around May 2016. The event is normally held around Jan. 25, and traditionally convenes after the inauguration of a U.S. president following an election year. To accommodate Xi however, organizers agreed to move the gathering forward to Jan. 17-20, to avoid the Chinese New Year on Jan. 28. \n   \nXi and his team initially expected to attend Davos just before Hillary Clinton's inauguration as president. Yet the vote for Brexit in the U.K. in June and Trump's ensuing victory in the U.S. drastically changed the landscape facing them. Here was an unprecedented opportunity to portray Xi as one of the few global leaders who had not succumbed to populism and protectionism. \n \nXi's team decided to fill the itinerary of his Swiss trip with more \"global leader\" appearances, including a visit to the offices of the United Nations and the World Health Organization in Geneva and the International Olympic Committee's headquarters in Lausanne. \n \n\"All countries should jointly shape the future of the world, write international rules, manage global affairs and ensure that development outcomes are shared by all,\" he said at the U.N. office. \n \nINTERNAL POLITICS Xi's grand tour of Switzerland -- where Premier Zhou Enlai headed a Chinese delegation to the Geneva Conference in 1954, signaling China's debut on the international stage -- was carefully choreographed to boost the president's credentials ahead of the party congress to be held in autumn, where the country's leadership for the next five years will be decided. Xi, who is up for a second term, is expected to solidify his one-man rule. \n \n\"To hold the party congress in a victorious fashion, this year's Chinese diplomacy will create an even more favorable external environment,\" Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters after Davos. \n \nThe choreography continues. In his Davos speech, Xi announced he will host a gathering in May of leaders involved in China's Belt and Road Initiative -- a plan to build infrastructure across Asia and create an economic area centered on China. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte immediately announced that he will be attending. \n \nIn August, Foreign Minister Wang will attend the ASEAN Regional Forum hosted by Duterte in Manila, where China and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are expected to agree on a binding code of conduct in the South China Sea. Following China's defeat in a case heard by an international tribunal -- arguably Beijing's biggest diplomatic setback of 2016 -- Xi likely wants to prevent the South China Sea from becoming a hot topic before he is anointed for a second term. \n \nAnd in September, Xi will host the BRICS leaders' summit in Xiamen, a city in Fujian Province, where he spent 17 years as a local official. The idea, apparently, is to show how much Xiamen's favorite son has progressed. \n   \nMeanwhile, on his first day in office, Trump announced via the White House website the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and his intention to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. \n \nCompanies with operations in both the U.S. and China will be carefully watching these developments. In Davos, Asian business leaders were peppered with questions about how they will respond to the new \"Trump world.\" \n \nAmong them was Jack Ma Yun. The CEO of Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba Group Holding has had a busy month, first visiting New York for a meeting with Trump on Jan. 9, then appearing in Davos as part of Xi's massive business delegation. \n \nIt was clear where Ma's allegiance were. \"American international companies made millions and millions of dollars from globalization,\" he said in Davos. \"The question is: Where did that money go? In the past 30 years, America has had 13 wars at a cost of $14.2 trillion. That's where the money went,\" he said sharply. \n \nChina's richest man, Dalian Wanda Group Chairman Wang Jianlin, was also at Davos. Last year, he went on a buying spree in Hollywood, acquiring Legendary Entertainment and Dick Clark Productions. Wang urged the U.S. not to erect barriers against Chinese investment into Hollywood. \"We don't interfere with the content,\" he said. \"I just want the profit.\" \n \nWang said he has asked former Sen. Christopher Dodd, now chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America, to carry a message to Trump urging him to \"leave the entertainment industry alone.\" \n \nAmid the global turmoil, China's economy has been enjoying a relatively positive few months. Stock prices have stabilized and consumption is healthy. \"The biggest risk ahead for China is the direction of U.S.-China relations,\" said Shingo Ito, the head of the China team at Mizuho Research Institute. \n \nThere are several aspects to that risk: Trump labeling China as a currency manipulator, his threat to impose a 45% tariff on Chinese-made goods and higher U.S. interest rates, which could accelerate capital flight from China. Any of these could easily force Xi to abandon his lofty rhetoric and put China back on a protectionist path. \n \nDavos closed with a session with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who paved the way for President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China in 1972. Xi's speech, Kissinger said, \"was an assertion by China of participating in the construction of an international order.\" \n \nFormer President Barack Obama, he said, had begun to withdraw not only from places in which the U.S. was over-extended but \"even places in which its contribution remained essential.\" \n \nThat long-term trend, according to Kissinger, leaves a quandary for Obama's successor: \"President Trump will have to find a definition of the American role ... and define what and where America can lead.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump and Xi lay out global visions that are worlds apart","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Eastern Asia","countryCode":"JP","country":"Japan"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Nikkei Asian Review","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"433370176","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"205"},"name":"Nikkei Asian Review","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://asia.nikkei.com","publisher":"Nikkei"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194800957","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

On Jan. 20, Cai Qi and Ying Yong became the latest to join this growing political army.  \n \nCai, the acting mayor of Beijing, and Ying, the vice mayor of Shanghai, were both elevated to mayor of their respective metropolises. \n \nThe Politburo Standing Committee -- the Communist Party's top decision-making body, led by Xi -- is due for a shake-up at the next national party congress this autumn. Most of the seven current committee members have reached retirement age. The 63-year-old Xi, who doubles as the party's general secretary, will stay on. \n \nXi's maneuvering comes at a time of high tension between Beijing and Washington, on both the economic and security fronts. But the Chinese leader has at least one thing in common with Trump, the 70-year-old property tycoon and Republican outsider: a personnel policy based on favoritism, be it cronyism or nepotism. \n \nCompared with their predecessors, both presidents were slow to jump into politics. Xi did it in his 50s; Trump much later in life. Having not spent their lives building political bridges, perhaps, they tend to rely on limited pools of like-minded talent. The problem is that teams filled with yes men are prone to malfunctioning. \n \nFactions and friction \n \nXi rose to power at the party's last national congress in the autumn of 2012, when he assumed the post of general secretary. He became president in spring 2013. Since then, he has been using his anti-corruption crusade to bring down political foes and shore up his power. \n \nNot a few rivals have already been purged. Those who remain are so frightened that they keep low profiles, hoping to ride out the storm. This creates an illusion that the party is united. But Xi has defied convention, both in how he emerged and how he rules. \n       \nXi secured an unusual promotion at the party congress in 2007: He became a member of the standing committee and leapfrogged his way to the sixth-ranked post in the hierarchy. That was one notch higher than Li Keqiang, a protege of then President Hu Jintao. \n \nThis made Xi a shoo-in to succeed Hu. Li ended up as premier. \n \nUnlike Xi, Hu was still in his 40s when he emerged as a leader of the future. To be sure, Hu tapped into his power base -- the Communist Youth League -- to fill a number of important positions. But he also advocated standardizing the criteria for promoting party officials. \n \nXi has shunned any institutionalized promotion system. Instead, he has tapped former subordinates and old friends for most key positions. \n \nThe No. 1 requirement for promotion: loyalty to the boss. \n \nBroadly speaking, the Communist Party is divided into three groups: Xi's clique; the Communist Youth League faction, comprising former officials of the massive party youth organization; and former President Jiang Zemin's faction. \n \nXi's group, then, is split between the Zhejiang and Fujian factions. These are made up of former underlings from the days when Xi held party posts in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. \n \nThe majority of his personnel picks come from these two factions, with the folks from Zhejiang taking precedence. It was in Zhejiang that Xi became a top provincial official for the first time, serving as party chief from 2002 to 2007. He regards the province as his second home. \n \nOne prominent member of the Zhejiang faction is Chen Min'er, 56, the current party chief in the province of Guizhou. Chen served as president of the Zhejiang Daily Press Group when he was in his 30s. He later became the province's top propaganda official, tasked with supervising local media outlets. \n \nChen's knack for writing earned him a job as Xi's speechwriter while he was the provincial party chief. Chen has since climbed the party ladder quickly. \n \nYing, the new Shanghai mayor, also hails from the faction. When Xi was promoted to party chief in Shanghai in 2007, he brought Ying to the city with him. \n \nAt 59, Ying has a great deal of experience in judicial and public security affairs. But as mayor, he is useful to Xi in another way: countering the local influence of former President Jiang's group, known as the Shanghai faction.  \n \nXi spent nearly 17 years in Fujian, before moving to Zhejiang. He rose as high as provincial governor -- the No. 2 post, after provincial party chief. But insiders say his network of connections there pales in comparison to his Zhejiang ties, explaining why the Fujian faction plays second fiddle.   \n \nWang Xiaohong, Beijing's public security bureau chief, belongs to the Fujian group. The 59-year-old concurrently serves as the Chinese capital's vice mayor. \n \nWang is an expert on security, having served as the top security official in the Fujian city of Xiamen, but he is not necessarily familiar with Beijing. Yet Xi made him the top watchdog in the capital. \n \nApparently, Xi feared for his own physical safety and wanted someone who would never betray him. \n \nWang is also close to Xi's wife, Peng Liyuan. After divorcing his first wife, Xi married Peng, a popular singer in the military, during his time in Fujian.  \n \nSome close aides straddle both factions. Cai, the 61-year-old new mayor of Beijing, is one. Xi got to know Cai in his Fujian days and brought him along to Zhejiang. \n \nAnother example is Huang Kunming, 60, the executive deputy head of the Communist Party's Publicity Department. Huang is in charge of manipulating public opinion. \n \nCircle of friends \n \nXi has also reached further back into his past and tapped old friends for crucial jobs. \n \nChen Xi, 63, serves as executive deputy head of the Communist Party's Organization Department. The department oversees personnel affairs -- a critical position ahead of the next national congress. \n \nChen Xi and the president both graduated from Beijing's Tsinghua University, where they were roommates. \n \nLiu He, 65, is the oldest pal among Xi's close aides. They both graduated from the prestigious Beijing 101 Middle School -- the school of choice for many children of senior Communist Party and military officials. \n \nLiu is Xi's top economic adviser. He currently serves as director of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs, the party's key economic panel. \n \nAnti-corruption czar Wang Qishan, 68, and Xi also go way back. \n \nDuring the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution, \"intellectual youths\" from the cities were sent to live and work in rural areas under the \"Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside Movement.\" \n \nWhen Xi was 15, he too was \"sent down\" from Beijing to a remote farming village near Yan'an, Shaanxi Province. Wang was sent to the area around the same time. Today, Wang is spearheading the crackdown on graft as head of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and is one of Xi's most trusted allies. \n \nThe Communist Party's General Office is headed by Li Zhanshu, 66. Li and Xi became acquainted in Hebei Province, when the future president was in his 20s. \n \nThe executive deputy head of the General Office, 54-year-old Ding Xuexiang, served as Xi's secretary when he was the party chief in Shanghai. Ding is also head of the General Secretary's Office. \n \nTrump's way \n \nIt is easy to see similarities in President Trump's approach. For starters, he made his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. \n \nOne diplomat who has been stationed in the U.S. and Europe weighed in on Trump's personnel appointments. \n \n\"When it comes to security, he thinks of generals he's seen in war movies and appoints military personnel to government posts,\" the diplomat said. \"As for the economy, he can think of only financial people he knows on Wall Street, such as those from Goldman Sachs.\" \n \nTrump, who never held public office prior to becoming president, is forming a team with plenty of yes men, much like Xi.  \n \nPolitically, this is a particularly sensitive year for China. The tug-of-war within the party is expected to intensify before the new leadership lineup is announced in the autumn. Various forces will be looking to put their rivals at a disadvantage, and could seek to exploit tensions with the U.S.  \n \nThe question is: Will the two presidents' yes men manage to find common ground amid growing friction over trade and security?","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Beijing news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"China news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Xi, Trump share same Achilles' heel","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Eastern Asia","countryCode":"JP","country":"Japan"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Nikkei Asian Review","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"433370176","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"205"},"name":"Nikkei Asian Review","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://asia.nikkei.com","publisher":"Nikkei"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194801197","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Schools in Munster and Leinster have seen the most dramatic improvements in academic performance over the last eight years, with some doubling the number of students they have sent to third level colleges in that time, the Sunday Independent school league tables reveal. Three schools placed just half of their pupils in third level in 2009 but have improved at such a rate since that they recorded perfect results last year. Presentation Secondary School, Ballingarry, Co Tipperary; Scoil Aireagail, Ballyhale, Co Kilkenny; and Kilrush Community School, Co Clare have made the biggest strides nationally.\n\nThe trio sent 51pc of their students on to universities, institutes of technology and other colleges eight years ago. However, they were among a group of 83 schools nationally to send all of their pupils on to third level last September. Overall, fee-paying schools continue to dominate when it comes to sending students to third level, but schools in the free scheme are catching up.\n\nOut of more than 700 schools analysed nationwide, just six have maintained a 100pc record in sending students on to third level in that time, according to figures covering eight years of college entry data. Just one non-fee-paying school has maintained that perfect record since 2009.\n\nBy comparing the percentage of students who were admitted to a university after studying in a school with a perfect record, it is possible to distinguish which is the best performer overall. The figures compiled by the Sunday Independent in the most comprehensive study of its kind to date show that Glenstal Abbey, Co Limerick, has emerged as the county\u2019s best-performing school, up two places from third on last year\u2019s tables.\n\nIt just pipped Presentation Brothers College in the Mardyke, Cork to top spot. An analysis of the data shows Glenstal Abbey has had the greatest percentage of students going to university since 2009.\n\nDigging deeper it is possible to see that the school, which charges a \u20ac18,950 seven-day boarding fee, sends a majority of its students on to Dublin-based universities. A special supplement with the full details of this year\u2019s school league tables is published today only in the Sunday Independent.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Wayne O'Connor"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Which are the three most improved secondary schools in the country?","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"IE","country":"Ireland"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Irish Independent","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660181","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"290"},"name":"Irish Independent","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Education","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://independent.ie"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.carsireland.ie/","http://www.carsireland.ie/index.php","http://www.carsireland.ie/car-dealers/","http://www.irishjobs.ie/?cid=Partner_INM_JobSearchBoxUrl","http://www.themeetingpoint.ie/?utm_source=independent&utm_campaign=navbar&utm_term=unknown","http://www.themeetingpoint.ie/mature-dating/?utm_source=independent&utm_campaign=navbar&utm_term=unknown","http://www.themeetingpoint.ie/gay-dating/?utm_source=independent&utm_campaign=navbar&utm_term=unknown","http://www.inotices.ie/","http://www.inotices.ie/death-notices","https://www.fitlive.ie/","https://www.fitlive.ie/events/","https://www.fitlive.ie/training/","https://www.hotelscombined.ie/?a_aid=143290&label=Hotels-tab","https://www.clickandgo.com/special-offers?utm_source=HolidayDeals&utm_medium=Content&utm_term=HolidayDeals&utm_content=HolidayDeals&utm_campaign=HolidayDeals%20Link","https://www.facebook.com/Independent.ie","https://twitter.com/Independent_ie","https://plus.google.com/116623388763634190489","http://livefyre.com/","http://livefyre.com/?ref_noscript","http://www.farmireland.ie/","http://www.inm.ie/contact/","http://www.inm.ie/"],"sequenceId":"695194808453","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.independent.ie/regionals/kerryman/news/article35358031.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/2017-01-11_ker_27594059_I2.JPG"},{"url":"http://cdn-03.independent.ie/regionals/kerryman/news/article35358031.ece/8b727/AUTOCROP/w620h342/2017-01-11_ker_27594059_I2.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

The biggest takeaway from playing this as the Switch event was the fact we were able to play split-screen on the Nintendo Switch in tabletop mode and boy does this change everything. The fact that you can literally take this game with you on your Switch tablet and play two-player split-screen with a single Joy-con each is a game changer. I never took my Wii U anywhere and whilst I ways took my 3DS with me, it was only really a single-player machine and there\u2019s where the Nintendo Switch will hopefully bring back co-op gameplay. \n \n\n \nI don\u2019t hate the inclusion of being able to carry two items but I don\u2019t think it was entirely necessary either. The courses aren\u2019t really long enough to the point that you need to be holding two items at any given time in my opinion. \n \nI had the chance to play the new battle mode. More specifically, the new balloon fight on the Splatoon course. It felt much more closer to the more traditional battle mode that I\u2019ve always loved about Mario Kart. Not quite what it was on the Nintendo 64, but it\u2019s definitely a ton of fun, and it\u2019s set to get a lot more play time with the aforementioned tabletop play. \n \n \nLittle needs said regarding Mario Kart 8 Deluxe; it\u2019s more or less the same Mario Kart Wii U owners are already familiar with, albeit with a few more bells and whistles. This, of course means it is still fantastic and made better with the inclusion of all the DLC, the return of Battle Mode and the ability to carry two items. \n \n\n \nThe versatility of the Switch really shines with Mario Kart. Playing on the big screen, in TV Mode, of course looks fantastic, but even sat at a table, you and your friend looking at the Switch\u2019s screen, each armed with a Joy-Con each, the game still looks and feels incredible. The social nature of the Switch really shines here, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe will likely be an essential game to have in any Switch owner\u2019s collection. \n  \nMario Kart 8 Deluxe will release exclusively on Nintendo Switch on April 28th.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Shannon Grixti"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: video game news","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Video game industry news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Hands-on Preview (Nintendo Switch)","source":{"location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"name":"Press Start Australia \u2013 Bringing The Best Of Video Games & Gaming To Australia","feed":{"tags":[],"id":"427762600","publishingPlatform":"WordPress","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"autoRankOrder":"57344","inboundLinkCount":"11","autoRank":"6"},"name":"Press Start Australia \u2013 Bringing The Best Of Video Games & Gaming To Australia","dataFormat":"text","generator":"https://wordpress.org/?v=4.6.3","autoTopics":["ugc arts feeds"],"language":"English","mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://press-start.com.au"},"commentsUrl":"http://press-start.com.au/features/2017/01/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-nintendo-switch/#respond","dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://cdn-press-start.scadigital.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MK8-SHANNON.png","http://cdn-press-start.scadigital.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MK2.jpg","http://cdn-press-start.scadigital.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MK8-EWAN.png","http://cdn-press-start.scadigital.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MK8-1.jpg"],"sequenceId":"695194810127","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-19T23:01:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn-press-start.scadigital.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MK8-EWAN.png"},{"url":"http://cdn-press-start.scadigital.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MK8-1.jpg"},{"url":"http://cdn-press-start.scadigital.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MK8-SHANNON.png"},{"url":"http://cdn-press-start.scadigital.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MK2.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It gained popularity through such charms as luxury sleeping cars and a dining car where travelers could enjoy French-style cuisine. However, to the regret of many fans, in August 2015 the train service was discontinued due to the opening of the Hokkaido Shinkansen line and the aging of the Hokutosei train cars.\n\nLast month, the Hokutosei was \"revived\" as a hostel in the Nihonbashi Bakurocho area of central Tokyo. Called Train Hostel Hokutosei, the hostel reuses train car equipment and has become a hot topic among railway enthusiasts who consider it a rebirth of their beloved sleeper express.\n\nThe hostel differs from ordinary accommodations, with large dormitory-type guest rooms shared by men and women on three floors and a large guest room exclusively for women on one floor. Its 38 bunk beds and two semiprivate rooms can accommodate up to 78 overnight guests. Restrooms, shower rooms and a kitchen are shared.\n\nMany of the interior items, including the bunk beds, were previously used in the sleeper express.\n\nSigns bearing train car numbers are posted at the entrance to each of the large guest rooms. Reading lights installed beside the beds are the actual ones used in the sleeping cars. In addition, the door to the dining car has been reused as the hostel's restroom door.\n\n\"I traveled on the Hokutosei train several times,\" said a company employee in his 40s living in Itabashi Ward, Tokyo, who stayed at the hostel overnight. \"Memories come flooding back at the smell and the feel of things here. I'd like to come again.\n\n\"I used to think I'd have a drink with my son, who's now in elementary school, on board the sleeper express some day,\" he said with a tinge of regret. \"But the dream will have to stay a dream, and that's too bad.\"\n\nCurrently, even Hokutosei fans from nearby are said to be coming in large numbers to stay the night at the hostel.\n\nThe idea for the Hokutosei hostel came from the East Japan Railway Co. group, one of the train's operators, and a company in Chiba Prefecture whose business involves repurposing unused property as accommodation facilities and managing those facilities. They hoped to re-create the experience of a trip on the Hokutosei for businesspeople and foreign tourists looking to casually enjoy a long stay in Japan. Renovation work, which incorporated the sleeper express' design concept of making the best use of limited space, was carried out in an existing seven-story building above the underground JR Bakurocho Station.\n\nAccommodation fees vary depending on preferences, but largely go from about 2,500 to 4,000 yen ($22 to $35 U.S.) per night.\n\nThe Nihonbashi Bakurocho area is near the starting point of what were the Gokaido highways - the five major highways linking Edo, the current Tokyo, and regional areas during the Edo period (1603-1867). The area is said to have flourished as a town of hatagoya inns.\n\nRecently, as the number of foreign tourists to Japan has rapidly risen, a growing number of accommodation facilities have emerged in the area to meet the needs of tourists seeking long-term stays at low rates.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ryuzo Suzuki The Japan News/Yomiuri"},"topics":[{"name":"Tokyo news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Japan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Elements of sleeper train revived as Tokyo hostel","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Volusia","zipCode":"32117","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Daytona Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daytona Beach News Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666623","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3018"},"name":"Daytona Beach News Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news-journalonline.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194821748","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.news-journalonline.com/storyimage/LK/20170129/NEWS/170128500/AR/0/AR-170128500.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

While incidents that result in these deaths should be reviewed, there is no definite conclusion to be made.\n\nSecond, pedestrian safety should not have priority. Aren\u2019t all lives special? Many deaths are created by carelessness or bad behavior, and are caused by those who are the victims of such encounters. So with some 80 percent of deaths occurring after dark, better lighting and educating pedestrians on the need to wear light-reflective clothing would be a big help to motorists. I\u2019m sure all of us have been out at night and seen folks crossing or walking along roads, and noted that their clothing made it very difficult to see them.\n\nWith more visitors coming to our area and with the warm weather much of this year, it is reasonable that more people are walking and bicycling than in colder, more rainy years.\n\nBefore we attempt to arrive at possible changes that could affect some of the issues causing the higher number of roadway deaths, first we need to look at the causes. That information is lacking at this point, and guessing at the problems will not help matters. When I see words like \u201cbelieved,\u201d \u201csuspects\u201d and \u201cprobably\u201d used by authorities in trying to figure out what to do, I know that these folks don\u2019t know why this happening and thus are just guessing at answers. Would patients want their doctors guessing at what to do when they have a medical issue? I think not.\n\nLet\u2019s get the facts together and study them before jumping to conclusions.\n\nOne thing we should not do is pass more laws about what people cannot do in their cars. Whether it be seat belt use, having an open container inside, or texting or otherwise using a cellphone, such laws just become revenue streams and provide law enforcement with excuses for stopping motorists who are posing no harm to others. This also removes our scarce and valuable police from patrolling for the real problem: drivers who we all see, all too often, getting away with bad and dangerous behavior. We should be concentrating on drivers who show by their actions on the road that they are a threat to others.\n\nIn statistics I have seen, pedestrians are as often as not responsible for getting hit by vehicles. I\u2019m all for the crosswalks with flashing lights that are used in high-pedestrian areas such as Clearwater Beach. Woe be you as a motorist or pedestrian if you do not use and honor the crossings as intended.\n\nThe advent of the \u201cShare The Road\u201d campaign is another problem because it pushes bicycle use of roadways. Combining high- and low-speed traffic is dangerous, which is why most freeways prohibit pedestrians and bicyclists. Marked bike lanes also shrink the pavement for vehicles, increasing chances of collisions with other vehicles. Motorists, not bicyclists, paid for the roadway \u2014 and considering 99 percent of people use roadways to travel or engage in commerce, the speedy and efficient use of highways by vehicles should be the highest priority. That said, sidewalks and bicycle paths are good community investments but not with highway funds.\n\nLet\u2019s figure out what the problem is before we come up with a big plan that may not address the real issues.\n\n\u2014 McGuire, of Palm Coast, is a longtime activist with the National Motorists Association.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"MIKE MCGUIRE: Find traffic safety fixes that work","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Volusia","zipCode":"32117","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Daytona Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daytona Beach News Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666623","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3018"},"name":"Daytona Beach News Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news-journalonline.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194822593","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.news-journalonline.com/storyimage/LK/20170128/OPINION/170127603/AR/0/AR-170127603.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But first, let's discuss the past few days.\n\nLast week, I found myself in a running debate on social media with supporters of President Donald Trump over a couple statements the new president made.\n\nFirst Trump insisted his inauguration attracted the largest crowd ever in Washington, D.C. Various press reports pointed out clear visual evidence that both President Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration and the women's protest march in the nation's capital the day after Trump's inauguration drew larger crowds than Trump's inauguration. That led an agitated White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer to hold a no-questions press conference last Saturday night to excoriate the media for \"deliberately false reporting.\"\n\nOn Sunday morning, I challenged a post on Volusia County Republican Party Chair Tony Ledbetter's Facebook page that repeated the suggestion that the so-called \"mainstream media\" were publishing false news about Trump's inaugural crowd. \n\nAmong other things, I pointed out that crowd scientists who studied photos of both events concluded that the women's protest march was about three times the size of Trump's inaugural crowd. They also concluded that Obama's 2009 inaugural crowd was bigger than Trump's inaugural. That brought a response from Ledbetter, who attended Trump's inauguration. \"Pat, really, crowd scientists. NOW THAT IS REALLY FAKE NEWS,\" he wrote. \n\nOn Monday, during a meeting with leaders from both parties of Congress, Trump insisted that he would have won the popular vote if millions of illegal immigrants hadn't voted for his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Then, early Wednesday morning, Trump tweeted that he will launch a \"major investigation\" into voter fraud.\n\nThat led me to post on my Facebook page: \"Our new president continues to insist that he would have won the popular vote if so many illegal immigrants hadn't voted. Only no one can find any credible evidence to back that up. But there is significant evidence that it's not true. Now Trump has promised a 'major investigation' into voter fraud. I wonder how much this will cost taxpayers.\"\n\nFacebook friend Paul Zimmerman weighed in with a number of comments in favor of an investigation, including: \"I believe the reason there is no 'credible' evidence is because if it is happening, what party do you think would benefit from the fraud?\" (I'm pretty sure he means the Democrats.)\n\nTrump is colorful and charismatic, and some of his goals \u2014 leveling the trade playing field with other nations, creating higher-paying American jobs, and securing our borders \u2014 resonate with many Americans. \n\nHe is combative \u2014 witness last week's Twitter battle with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto over Trump's vow to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, and make Mexico pay for it. The snit led to Nieto canceling a trip to the U.S.\n\nAbove all, Trump and his closest advisers see the media as the enemy. When the media challenge Trump's \"alternative facts,\" many of his supporters see nothing wrong with accusing the media of producing \"fake news\" for doing so.\n\nWhat's a community newspaper to do?\n\nWell, for starters we're going to continue to ensure that The News-Journal's opinion pages remain politically independent. Our core principles \u2014 protecting individual rights; support of free enterprise; championing small government and the belief that most issues should be resolved at the local level; cheering community involvement; and using facts to shape our opinions \u2014 will continue to guide us.\n\nSecondly, we'll continue to report accurately about Trump. If Trump \u2014 or any other politician \u2014 pushes \"alternative facts,\" we plan to report it. That's our job.\n\nFinally, we will maintain an open dialogue about the news with our readers. To that end, consider this an invitation to attend one of our daily morning news meetings, where we discuss stories our reporters are writing as well as the rest of the news. The meetings begin weekdays at 10 a.m. and usually end by 10:45 a.m. To attend, call at least 24 hours in advance so we can be sure to have a chair for you.

He promises \u201cprotection\u201d to prevent foreigners from \u201cdestroying\u201d manufacturing jobs by exporting to America things that Americans want to import. Does he know that one American company might be \u201cdestroying\u201d more American jobs than China is? And that this supposed destruction is beneficial?\n\nThe company is Amazon (market capitalization: $390 billion), created by Jeffrey P. Bezos. He owns The Post, but it is for revolutionizing retailing that he ranks in the pantheon of American business. He belongs there with Richard Warren Sears, Alvah Curtis Roebuck, Aaron Montgomery Ward and Sam Walton, all of whom were constructively disruptive retailers and were as important in the nation\u2019s commercial history as were Henry Ford, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.\n\nIn 2016, online buying during the holiday season surged 19 percent over the year before, which is one factor explaining this: Macy\u2019s, after announcing in August that it would close 100\u2009more of its remaining 730 stores, now says it will shed 10,000 jobs. Sears, which is 13 decades old and still has 1,600 stores, has lost $9 billion in five years, has closed 500 stores and is closing 150 more.\n\nSears stores in American downtowns, and the Sears catalog that put downtown goods within reach of rural America, caused difficulties for older retailers. In the second half of the 20th\u2009century, Walmarts at the edge of towns caused difficulties for downtown retailers with pre-modern \u2014 meaning pre-Walmart \u2014 global supply chains. Now Amazon is forcing Walmart to master online retailing.\n\nAlthough e-commerce was just 8\u2009percent of all 2016 retail sales, it came disproportionately at the expense of Sears, Macy\u2019s and other \u201canchor tenants\u201d that draw foot traffic from which other mall retailers benefit. When Amazon recently announced that it is going to create 100,000 warehousing and other jobs in the next 18 months, the New York Times reported that online retailing \u201chas destroyed many times that number of positions at malls and shopping centers across America.\u201d\n\nBut Henry Ford, too, \u201cdestroyed\u201d lots of jobs \u2014 those of blacksmiths, buggy-makers, etc. \u2014 the holders of which moved on, and usually up.\n\nWriting at MarketWatch, Rex Nutting argues that as Amazon revolutionizes consumer behavior, it \u201cis going to destroy more American jobs than China ever did.\u201d If so, the \u201cproblem\u201d is productivity. Nutting says \u201cAmazon needs about half as many workers to sell $100 worth of merchandise as Macy\u2019s does.\u201d The Times reports that \u201cthe typical online retailer generates $1,267,000 in sales per employee versus $279,000 at bricks-and-mortar stores.\u201d\n\nAll of which raises a question: Why should manufacturing jobs lost to foreign competition be privileged by protectionist policies in ways that jobs lost to domestic competition are not? When an Applebee\u2019s or Olive Garden, powered by a national advertising budget, opens next to, and causes the closing of, Madge\u2019s Diner, why does Madge not merit protection?\n\nThe reason is this: Domestic protection of Madge and millions of others unsettled by the constant churning of a dynamic domestic economy would mean slow economic growth \u2014 and rapid growth of government as it regulates consumers\u2019 choices and their consequences. But protection from imports also means this.\n\nReactionary liberalism has long held, and today\u2019s faux conservatism agrees, that existing jobs should be protected by policies that reduce the economic dynamism that threatens those jobs. Such protection means a net decrease in jobs but an increase in the self-esteem of blinkered protectionists who see the jobs \u201csaved\u201d but not those that, as a result of lost dynamism, are lost or never created.\n\n\u2014 Will is a Washington Post columnist.

Texting and other screen-related activities should be primary offenses, and the fines should be significant. There\u2019s nothing so important on the screen that anyone needs to take their eyes off the road.\n\n(READ: Stop the carnage on local roads)\n\nYou did, however, leave out one significant contributing factor to the carnage, and that\u2019s the pedestrians and bicyclists themselves. Many times, at least from my observation, they are their own worst enemies. Just last week, I barely missed hitting a jogger in the dark, wearing black clothes, running in the road when there was a perfectly good sidewalk four feet away. It\u2019s not only stupid, it\u2019s illegal. Florida statute 316.130, section 3 says: \u201cWhere sidewalks are provided, no pedestrian shall, unless required by other circumstances, walk along and upon the portion of a roadway paved for vehicular traffic.\u201d\n\nAnd the people who cross our busiest roads in the middle of a block when a crosswalk with a traffic light is only a few steps away defy any logic or common sense. The same statute makes this illegal as well.\n\nBut the bicyclists who ignore the rules of the road are the worst. They zoom in and out of traffic, oblivious to the danger, and ride two and three abreast knowing they are impeding the flow of traffic, almost challenging drivers to pass them. Here\u2019s a blinding glimpse of the obvious: They may win the moment, but when it\u2019s car versus bicycle, the bicycle loses every time.\n\nThere\u2019s lots of blame to go around, but let\u2019s hope transportation officials look at all the factors, including the actions of people who choose to play chicken with a 3,000-pound car.\n\nSteve Burdette\n\nDaytona Beach\n\nSee those signs\n\nWith all the recent articles and opinions about traffic safety, texting, etc., I think it is time to address another concern for traffic safety.\n\n(READ: Volusia, Flagler see major increases in traffic fatalities)\n\nHave motorists forgotten the meaning of \u201cyield\u201d? All too often I encounter motorists merging onto a high-speed highway such as an interstate, expecting the fast-moving vehicles to just move over and let them in. And, with the recent report in The News-Journal about the increase in accidents, it is even more imperative to abide by all the highway signs.\n\nTo yield is to \u201cgive way,\u201d which is what drivers are supposed to do when a \u201cyield\u201d sign is in their lane of traffic. As a courtesy, we all try to accommodate the incoming traffic when it is safe to do so. But when all lanes are jammed, or drivers are pulling large trailers, at times it is impossible to move over. The first and only expectation that should be considered is that the fast-moving vehicles cannot \u201cgive way,\u201d thereby requiring the incoming driver to either slow down or speed up to merge safely. Forcing or bullying a fast-moving vehicle to move over creates the possibility of a horrific accident.\n\nCome on, folks, let\u2019s use common sense and abide by the traffic signs that say \u201cyield,\u201d and we\u2019ll all make it to our destination alive!\n\nDennis Sender\n\nOrmond Beach\n\nPut phone down\n\nAgain, Mark Lane puts his fingers on the pulse of human action that tragically forces human interaction in his Jan. 26 column, \u201cCrash data shows need for tougher driver texting law.\u201d\n\nAbout 15 years ago, many drivers were suddenly driving around with what appeared to be toothaches or full-blown root canals \u2014 driving with one hand, cradling their jaws with the other. After inspection, it turns out they were talking, and talking \u2014 for many miles \u2014 on those newfangled cellphone devices.\n\nFast forward, and now they\u2019re staring at their crotches most of the time, often using one hand or both hands, fumbling with their iPhones while steering with their knees. Drivers are no longer in a rush. If in front when the light turns green, it could take an eternal five seconds for the brakes to come off. They slog along blissfully, leading Jim Morrison\u2019s \u201cSoft(ware) Parade,\u201d while proudly multi-tasking and feeling so much smarter than challenged, one-dimensional drivers. Some are so bold as to hold the iPhone up to the bottom or even the top of the steering wheel, tiring of raising their eyes every four seconds to view the road. If only the lives of pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists and other drivers and passengers were not at stake!\n\nJohn Arden\n\nDaytona Beach\n\nTracking local votes\n\nWith the recent attacks on the press, I want to say how much I appreciate The News-Journal\u2019s column entitled \u201cFlorida Tally: How Your U.S. Lawmakers voted.\u201d It\u2019s helpful for your readers to stay informed about how our lawmakers are voting, and to track their support or opposition to issues they find crucial in their community.\n\nI was alarmed, for example, to learn last week that U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis voted to reduce the power of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate the derivatives (swaps) market. Remember, these financial instruments were designed to expressly benefit large banks and institutions, leaving average citizens at great risk. The 2008 global financial crisis was caused, in large part, by that gamble finally collapsing \u2014 costing many middle-class families their homes and life savings.\n\nI\u2019m glad to know where DeSantis stands \u2014 valuing the profits of large financial institutions over average Floridians\u2019 economic security.\n\nThe fact that DeSantis voted to allow insurance companies to deny health care to those with pre-existing conditions was even more troubling to me. Knowing that he voted against an element of the Affordable Care Act that had bipartisan support was, frankly, terrifying. Considering how many people could lose their coverage without such protections should be a concern to all of us, whether or not we supported him in this last election.\n\nI do have one suggestion. If you could publish the bills that are going to be voted on in advance, it would be even more helpful. This way, the public could call their congressmen (202-225-3121) or senators (202-224-3121) to let their voices be heard before votes happen.\n\nLouise Booth\n\nPort Orange\n\nThe next play\n\nThe phrase \u201cimpeachment\u201d is already being tossed about.\n\nI\u2019m waiting for someone to catch it and run for a touchdown. It is then that the bands will play and the flags will wave and wave and wave.\n\nKate Ruhlman Claim victory\n\nBeing brought up in the middle of the middle class, I saw Donald Trump\u2019s victory as inevitable. It was plain (except to establishment elites) that Middle America was completely done with the economic deprivation of globalist hegemony. It was obvious that too many were riding in the wagon, with too few pulling. It was time for taxpaying citizens to take back their country.\n\nAdmittedly, prior to Inauguration Day, there remained a nagging doubt that somehow the powers that be might stop him. But they couldn\u2019t. He outworked, outflanked and outsmarted the entire Washington-media-Hollywood army of arrogance.\n\nPresident Trump for U.S. Let\u2019s roll.\n\nJoe Fieldus\n\nOrmond Beach\n\nCost of immigration\n\nAs a taxpayer I have often wondered why the costs of illegal immigrants living in our country are not deducted from any foreign aid provided to their country of origin. As of 2015, there were an estimated 73,665 non-U.S. citizens in state and federal prisons, accounting for approximately 5 percent of the prison population and costing taxpayers (based on 2012 figures) an average of $31,286 annually for a total cost of approximately $2.3 billion. Additionally, any costs associated with returning the released prisoners to their original home should also be recouped.\n\nAlso, according to the Center for Immigration Studies, illegal immigrant households receive an average of $5,692 in federal welfare benefits every year. Why can\u2019t their countries of origin pay for their illegal presence and costs to U.S. taxpayers? One can only imagine how many taxpayer dollars would be saved by this action.\n\nWilliam E. Patterson\n\nNew Smyrna Beach\n\nTrump\u2019s moves\n\nIn light of the recent actions of our new president, it is clear that he is comfortable with letting the taxpayers fund his follies. Billions for a wall that Mexico isn\u2019t buying, another extensive study searching for nonexistent voter fraud, a pipeline from Canada that we don\u2019t need, relocating the U.S. Embassy in Israel, etc. The fun just never ends.

Because like Hope Place, it had its ducks in a row.\n\nLast week, the local leaders responsible for Hope Place, a new facility in Daytona Beach for homeless families with children, held a groundbreaking ceremony at the former Hurst Elementary School. It was symbolically important, not just for what it means for Hope Place, but also for showing the community what can \u2014 and must \u2014 be accomplished with regard to other sectors of homelessness.\n\nThe dozens of community volunteers, social service administrators and elected officials crowded into a small, former classroom represented the collective support that was required to make Hope Place a reality. Forough Hosseini, founder and chair of Food Brings Hope, a local organization that helps feed needy families, was the driving force who had one goal in mind: that no child should be homeless. She enlisted the help of Mark Geallis, executive director of Halifax Urban Ministries, which will run and operate the shelter, as well as others to create a plan and draft a proposal.\n\n(READ: 300-bed family homeless shelter aiming to open in August)\n\nThey knew they needed the approval of the school district and School Board to sell the Hurst building and property, as well as financial support from Volusia County. Hosseini spent months negotiating behind the scenes, laying the groundwork. She initially asked County Manager Jim Dinneen for $1.5 million to acquire renovate the former school, but he said once he was sold on the project he convinced her the county needed to give $3.5 million to do Hope Place right.\n\nThat came with one major caveat: It would be a one-time appropriation. Under no circumstances would the county provide operating expenses.\n\nSo Hope Place has had to persuade several municipalities to pitch in $200,000 every year in addition to what Hosseini hopes to raise from private donors. Local hotels are donating furniture, and businesses are donating building materials.\n\nHope Place is an ambitious project with a lot of moving parts. That it is advancing toward fruition while other proposed homeless solutions have stalled is explained in part by the fact that families with children are an easier sell with a higher chance of success. Most are temporarily homeless because they are down on their luck, and are eager to get back on their feet and become independent again. They are not the chronic adult homeless who hang out in public areas and panhandle, many of whom suffer from mental illness and/or substance abuse. Those cases are more difficult to treat.\n\nBut Hope Place also received so much community support because its sponsors had a well-conceived plan and demonstrated strong leadership and commitment. To prove that success is not limited to families in need, the County Council recently unanimously approved giving $1.13 million to construct a 5,000-square-foot expansion of The Neighborhood Center of West Volusia in DeLand. The nonprofit will add 20 shelter beds and provide the homeless with services. In December, the DeLand City Commission approved spending $50,000 annually for five years on the shelter. The city\u2019s support was crucial to securing the county\u2019s contribution.\n\nWhy did The Neighborhood Center succeed? Because like Hope Place, it had its ducks in a row.\n\nMeanwhile, Daytona Beach, the county, other municipalities and the social services community continue to be fractured over a solution for the hardcore homeless, such as whether it should be a comprehensive shelter (and where it would be located) or a housing-first approach. Plenty of ideas have been batted around, but there\u2019s been no consensus. No leader has emerged to rally stakeholders around a strategy, and until that happens there will be no funding available.\n\nAs its name implies, Hope Place provides optimism for those in need. But it also provides the prospect that its template can be used to effect positive change in other areas of homelessness.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"OUR VIEW: Hope for the homeless","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Volusia","zipCode":"32117","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Daytona Beach","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Daytona Beach News Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666623","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3018"},"name":"Daytona Beach News Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news-journalonline.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194827475","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.news-journalonline.com/storyimage/LK/20170129/OPINION/170127600/AR/0/AR-170127600.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

After not an ideal effort last night, for our young team to bounce back and play that hard, and jump out to a lead on these guys was tremendous.\u201d \n \nIn his last four games, Croston has six goals with one assist, taking 15 shots on goal with a +7 rating (the first two games in that stretch were against a Division II opponent.) His statistical boost as of late follows a trend that dates all the way back to early November. \n \nRead more:   Anthony Croston producing mightily for ASU hockey since promotion \n \nMeanwhile, Daccord stopped 53 of 55 shots faced in net on Saturday for the win, breaking a streak of four straight starts by senior netminder Rob Levin . \n \nDespite the final score, Quinnipiac outshot ASU 55 to 19. \n \n\u201cJoey Daccord had his coming-out party,\u201d Powers said. \u201cWe all knew that was the type of game he is capable of having. If he can play like that and be confident in his ability \u2014 because his ability is off the chart \u2014 the sky is the limit for him.\u201d \n \nAfter struggling to find the net in the first 40 minutes of Friday\u2019s game, ASU took an early 1-0 lead on Saturday when sophomore forward Dylan Hollman found sophomore forward Anthony Croston in front of the QU net. \n \nThe Sun Devils led after nearly 15 minutes of scoreless hockey. \n \nWith just over three minutes left in the first period, an odd-man rush developed for QU that drew out from the ASU net. That left the door wide open for the Bobcats, but they failed to put it home. \n  \nOMG! What a series of saves & plays by the Devils! pic.twitter.com/oadsRuTNau \n\u2014 Sun Devil Hockey (@SunDevilHockey) January 29, 2017  \nFollowing that near-goal by QU, the Bobcats were called for too many men on the ice. The resulting power play yielded a booming slapshot by freshman defenseman Brinson Pasichnuk , putting ASU up 2-0. \n \nJust 22 seconds into the second period, Croston scored on a turnover by the Bobcats during 4-on-4 play. That made it 3-0 Sun Devils with Croston\u2019s second goal of the game. \n \nMidway through the second, QU senior forward Tim Clifton kicked a puck into the ASU net with his skate. The call on the ice was ruled a QU goal to end Daccord\u2019s shutout, but it was subsequently overturned. \n \nJust seconds later, Clifton got another chance and buried it in the net, getting QU on the board to make it 3-1 ASU. \n \nA goal by freshman defenseman Jakob Stridsberg closed out the second period as the Sun Devils went into second intermission with a 4-1 lead. \n \n\u201cStridsberg scored a huge goal to bump it back to a three-goal lead, and when that happened, I had a pretty good feeling,\u201d Powers said. \u201cWhen he scored that, and with Joey being as sharp as he was, I knew he wasn\u2019t going to give up four more goals.\u201d \n \nQU senior defenseman Connor Clifton scored his second goal of the weekend in the third period to cut his team\u2019s deficit to 4-2. But that would conclude the scoring for the evening as ASU hung on to win. \n \nThe Sun Devils\u2019 next opponent could prove to be an even taller task than Quinnipiac: ASU will travel to No. 13 Western Michigan for games on Friday and Saturday, finishing a stretch of four straight road games against ranked opponents. \n \n\u201cI think we played much more disciplined and stuck to our game plan, \" Powers said. \"We play a simple game against teams like this and our guys executed.\u201d \n \nReach the reporter at matthew.layman@asu.edu or follow  @Mattjlayman on Twitter. \n \nLike  State Press Sports on","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Layman"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Croston, Daccord lift ASU hockey to win at No. 17 Quinnipiac","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Maricopa","zipCode":"85287","state":"Arizona","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Tempe","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"ASU Web Devil","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169677431","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"ASU Web Devil","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.statepress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.asp/37493__mg_7177f.jpg","https://twitter.com/JDac35","https://t.co/oadsRuTNau","https://twitter.com/SunDevilHockey/status/825499548789436417","https://twitter.com/mattjlayman","https://www.facebook.com/ASUSPsports","https://twitter.com/statepresssport"],"sequenceId":"695194828681","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And Small Business Saturday was a busy day, said David Borlaug, president of the Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation, which runs the gallery. \n\n\"In spite of the bad weather, in terms of original art, sales have been great,\" he said. \"It validates Bismarck was ready for this kind of gallery.\" \n\nBorlaug said Bismarck has been \"blessed\" with a multitude of galleries, each with a different niche. Bismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative, Bismarck Art & Galleries Association and Gallery 522 all feature member artists' works. There's also Art Gallerie on Main, where Lydia Richez-Bowman features her own work and that of several other local artists, as well as teaching classes. \n\nBorlaug said Capital Gallery is focused on featuring two artists on its walls \u2014 one expressive and one traditional \u2014 along with several others who work in various other media, such as glass or bronze. The gallery sets itself apart by limiting the number of artists and featuring them for longer periods. And because it does not cater to member artists, \"the world's our oyster,\" he said. \n\nBorlaug has artists lined up for the foreseeable future, with Deane Collin Fay of Gackle alongside Bismarck native Vern Erickson's western Americana pieces coming up in Februarym The Bismarck Tribune (http://bit.ly/2joTPY3 ) reports. \n\n\"There is a thriving art culture in Bismarck,\" Borlaug said. \"We're just glad to be part of it.\" \n\nHe points to Jessica Wachter as an up-and-coming Bismarck artist who has a \"real following across the country,\" with works featured in galleries in Los Angeles and Scottsdale, Ariz. \n\nStephanie Delmore of Gallery 522 agrees. \n\n\"I think we're just getting to that point of there being enough galleries\" that they could partner on events, like gallery hops, she said. \"We can start to thread ourselves together.\" \n\nAs Bismarck's population has become more diverse, Delmore said there are more people who are used to going to galleries on a regular basis. \n\n\"I think the traffic is picking up,\" she said, with the public understanding what art adds to a community. \n\nSince starting 32 years ago, Gallery 522 has wanted all local artists to be able to show their work daily rather than wait five years for their turn at a larger show. \n\n\"We've always meant to be of service to artists,\" Delmore said, and on a day-to-day basis, the gallery has a multitude of artists covering its walls. \n\nBismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative works much the same way, though with slightly different rules and organization, while BAGA has become more well-known for hosting larger shows for its member artists, Delmore said. \n\n\"I think we've got a lovely base of artists in the area,\" she said, and having more galleries showcasing those artists could result in more art-focused events come spring. \n\nBorlaug said he thinks Bismarck is where Fargo was a couple decades ago in terms of growing from a big town to a small city \u2014 and art \"makes cities.\" \n\n\"I feel Bismarck is more than ready to grow its arts community,\" he said. \n\nIn turn, that community could help grow the city, attracting more residents.

Since wala pa si Alyssa ITC because she is new eh, ngayon lang siya magka-club, so pag ganoon ire-request nila (club team) sa NSA -- LVPI vice president Peter Cayco on Alyssa Valdez's delayed ITC release \n  \nLarong Volleyball sa Pilipinas, Inc. vice president Peter Cayco clarified that there was a miscommunication in the process of acquiring an international transfer certificate (ITC) that delayed Filipina superstar Alyssa Valdez's clearance to play in the Thai League Sunday afternoon. \n \nThe sports association came under fire Saturday following the reports that Valdez still has to receive her ITC to be able to suit up for 3BB Nakornnont in her debut game against King-Bangkok. \n \nIn a late report, Valdez received her ITC and was cleared to play. \n \nCayco was on the receiving end of criticism from volleyball fans, citing reports pointing that LVPI failed to register Valdez for an ITC. \n \nHe clarified that they did their part in giving the former three-time UAAP Most Valuable Player the go-signal to play in Thailand, adding that since Valdez is just applying for a new ITC the process of obtaining one falls on the side of 3BB Nakornnont.  \n \nCayco and Valdez met at the LVPI office in Arellano University in Taft Avenue last January 14 before she left for Thailand the day after.     \n \n\u201cYes, sila (club team) ang magre-request \u2018di ba? Since wala pa si Alyssa ITC because she is new eh, ngayon lang siya magka-club, so pag ganoon ire-request nila (club team) sa NSA,\u201d he explained Saturday during the national team tryouts. \u201cSo binigyan ko sila ng clearance, she\u2019s clear to play. Ang kuwan ko lang, kami (LVPI) daw ang humingi ng ITC dapat nga sila \u2018yung requesting club. Wala pa sayang previous ITC so what should have be done was kuha sila ng clearance sa amin, which I already gave.\u201d \n \n\u201cActually three letters na ang pinapadala ko. We met lang kasi the day before she left so after she left siguro after two days nagpadala na ako ng letter, then I sent a second letter and finally I sent a third letter on Friday that she\u2019s cleared to play,\u201d he continued. \u201cDapat sila na ang nagpa-process niyan eh. Kasi it\u2019s a new ITC and if it\u2019s new, club to NSA (dapat) it\u2019s not club to club kaya mas simple.\u201d \n \nCayco said that LVPI already cleared Valdez to play in Thailand, a historic feat for a Filipina spiker. \n \n\u201cEh ni-release ko na siya eh so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening,\u201d Cayco said. \u201cThat paper was Alyssa\u2019s letter to LVPI asking that she may be permitted to play so sinagot ko, after two days may sagot na ako doon, naka-CC, copy furnish si Alyssa. Siguradong maga-grant (ang request), ang sa akin lang na-late lang kasi sila tapos sasabihin bakit hindi pina-process.\u201d \n \nValdez trained for two weeks with the team but failed to send Cayco a copy of her contract and passport \u2013 the required documents needed by FIVB to process the ITC. \n \nLVPI received a copy of the contract just last Friday. \n \n\u201cI have (now) the records with me. I have been asking Alyssa to email me kasi she left na rin \u2018di ba? Before she left, she visited me here on Saturday, so I told her, Alyssa here\u2019s my email add send me a copy of your passport and your contract,\u201d Cayco said. \u201cBut it did not come, kinulit ko na lang siya, sabi ko please send me (the documents).\u201d \n \nCayco said that he sought the help of LVPI secretary general Ricky Palou to contact Valdez for the required documents but the former Ateneo de Manila athletics director told him that a contract in not necessary to acquire an ITC.    \n \n\u201cI asked Mr. Palou to help me get in touch with Alyssa so they sent me a copy of the passport. So ang hinihingi ng FIVB is the copy of the passport and the copy of the contract and he (Palou) told me they (FIVB) don\u2019t need the copy of the contract. I told him that\u2019s what they\u2019 re asking so I might as well give it kasi I cannot tell them naman na, \u2018huwag na \u2018yan\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cSo finally, I went direct to her club, I wrote them I think twice or thrice. Friday noon they sent me a copy of the contract signed by Alyssa Valdez so now I have with me a copy of her contract and a copy of her passport and yesterday (Saturday) I sent it immediately na to FIVB.

He identified elements of the plan that he said could positively impact future retail development. \n   \nCreating a mixed-use zoning district where both commercial and residential uses could be applied to one parcel would signal that the city is seeking retail development, he said. \n   \nRoth pointed to the vacant property at the junction of Lamar Parkway and Old Gray Summit as a candidate for mixed-use zoning. \n   \nThe property is now zoned residential, but Roth said the commission can designate future land use and identify the area as right for commercial development. \n   \n\u201cIt would still be zoned residential, but developers would see (on the future land use map) that the city wants commercial there,\u201d Roth said. \n   \nCommission member Linda Bruns pointed out that a developer had previously proposed constructing a mixed-use development with retail at the front and residences at the back on a nearby parcel, but neighbors opposed it. \n   \n\u201cThis room was full of people who didn\u2019t want retail there,\u201d she said. \n   \nRoth said he thought the desire for more retail development might influence residences on future commercial ventures at that location. \n   \nAlderman Nick Chlebowski, who has been editing the plan, said there are other areas in the city where mixed-use zoning districts might be attractive to developers. \n   \nMixed-use was originally put forth as a zoning tool to lure developers to the old downtown section, where mixed-use already exists in storefronts that have businesses on the ground floor and residences on the second floor. \n   \nChlebowski displayed a future land use map, which identified different areas of the city with different colors. He said he would not consider the area south of the tracks to be part of the downtown area. \n   \nChlebowski said the property south of Orleans Street between South First Street and the Meramec River could be designated a mixed-use district. \n   \nAlthough the property is zoned residential, he said it would be a good candidate for mixed-use zoning with parks as one of the approved elements in mixed-use districts. \n   \nSeeing the area, which is prone to flooding, designated as a future park would help with Alderman Steve Myers\u2019 plan to create a Meramec River Access and establish Pacific as a trailhead. \n   \nBruns said she likes the idea, which reminded her of the Downtown Washington riverfront, where a hiking/biking trail allows public access. \n   \nThe area now contains a mix of residences and vacant lots that were impacted by floods in 2008 and 2015. \n   \nP&Z members reviewed the final two sections of the proposed comprehensive plan at the meeting and said they are very close to bringing the completed version to a vote for adoption. \n   \nRoth said it\u2019s extremely important for the future development of the city for staff and P&Z to have a comprehensive plan as a tool to aid in development review. \n   \n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of activity of people who want to locate here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect to be very busy for the immediate future.

I was a little bit nervous at first, I just wanted to get it over with so it wasn't on my mind. It feels good.\n\nQ: You've been a cornerstone of this program for as long as you've been here. What does it feel like to see this program grow the way it has?\n\nA: It's rewarding. I think my first year we came in and we won three games. Now we're up to six. Every game this year's been close whereas other years we've been beat by 40 or something. It's nice to be in the game. Feels good.\n\nQ: Why did you decide to come to Presentation and what do you like about it?\n\nA: I wanted to be a nurse and they had a good program that works with basketball. I'm from Atwater, Minn., about three hours, three and a half. I like that it's small. You know everybody, you have friends everywhere, your class sizes are small and you're close with your professors. I like that.\n\nQ: What kind of a nurse do you want to be?\n\nA: I don't really know (laughs). I've got to figure it out I guess, I graduate in May.\n\nQ: What's something people might not know about you?\n\nA: My brother plays on the men's team, nobody probably really knows that.\n\nQ: What's something you like to do when you're not playing basketball?\n\nA: I like to take naps, when I can. Other than that just hang out with friends.\n\nQ: Favorite kind of music?\n\nA: Not anything really, I listen to it all. Probably favorite is country.\n\nQ: Who's your favorite country guy or gal?\n\nA: I don't know, anybody really.\n\nQ: What do you want to do when you're done here? Do you want to go back home?\n\nA: Probably, I don't know, right away anyway. In the long run I want to probably become a travel nurse, traveling around the country.\n\nQ: What are the biggest memories you'll take away from your time with the team?\n\nA: Those conference wins are always big memories, after not winning any to winning two, then three, it feels good. Good to win those.\n\nQ: Is there a message you'd want to leave for those who come to the program or remain after you leave?\n\nA: Don't take this time for granted because it goes by super fast. We're already at five weeks left in the season. That's crazy. I feel like I was just a freshman, now I'm at the end of my career.\n\nFollow @CuylerMeade_aan on Twitter. \u2022 5-10 Senior forward\n\n\u2022 1,010: Career points with the Saints\n\n\u2022 11.26: Points per game this season\n\n\u2022 6.35: Rebounds per game this season","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Cuyler Meade cmeade@aberdeennews.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Q&A: Senior Sydney Larson looks back on a great career","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Brown","zipCode":"57401","state":"South Dakota","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Aberdeen","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Aberdeen American News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169670338","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Aberdeen American News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.aberdeennews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194839828","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:55:31Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/aberdeennews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/35/5354ca70-b6f7-5ff9-bdcd-7d28cf21b3c1/588d5a4079c86.image.jpg?resize=300%2C306"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/aberdeennews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/35/5354ca70-b6f7-5ff9-bdcd-7d28cf21b3c1/588d5a4079c86.image.jpg?crop=589%2C331%2C0%2C134&amp;resize=589%2C331&amp;order=crop%2Cresize"}],"video":[]}}

We can also provide deliveries to the elderly and handicapped who have difficulty getting around.\u201d \n \nThe company, which has its business office in London, engineering in Estonia and some 90 employees, announced in January it had raised $17.2 million, led by Daimler AG with other investors as it moves to expand its testing and partnerships. \n \nWhile the Starship robots roll at a modest pace of around four miles (six kilometers) per hour, Harris-Burland said they offer a more efficient and economical delivery model than drones, which are being tested by online retail giant Amazon and others. \n   Starship Technology spokesman Henry Harris-Burland says the founders are looking to \u201cdisrupt\u201d an industry which has seen little efficiency improvement from new technology | © AFP/File | MANDEL NGAN   \nThe rolling robots are far less expensive to build and operate than drones and face fewer regulatory issues. \n \nHe said drones might be better-suited to remote and rural areas, while the Starship bots are designed for cities and suburbs, where they can roll along on sidewalks. \n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t see these as competing with drones, we see it as complementary,\u201d Harris-Burland said. \n \nThe Starship robots, which look like high-tech plastic picnic coolers, can carry about 20 pounds (nine kilograms) of goods, suited to three to four grocery bags. They do not offer heating or chilled compartments because rapid deliveries would not need them, according to Harris-Burland. \n \nThey will not have the capacity to leave items on doorsteps, he said, because \u201ccustomers will get delivery within 30 minutes, when they are home\u201d and collect the goods at the door. \n \n\u2013 Mapping sidewalks \u2013 \n \nStarship has agreements for testing with the delivery firm Postmates in Washington and DoorDash in California, as it works toward a commercial model with other partners and retailers. \n \nWhen the pilot begins in February, consumers will be able to order pizza, toothpaste, milk or eggs through the services which may use humans or robots. \n \nStarship is not the only robotic delivery startup looking to disrupt the sector. \n \nCalifornia-based startup Dispatch has raised $2 million in venture funding to begin testing of its rolling robots. Another California firm, Savioke, has agreed to provide delivery bots to hotels and apartment complexes. \n \nStarship says one of its strong points is its \u201cvisual localization\u201d technology that allows for real-time mapping using nine cameras on each robot to help navigate along sidewalks and circumvent obstacles, people and pets. \n \n\u201cWe can see every crosswalk, every traffic light, every pothole,\u201d Harris-Burland said. \n \n\u201cA lot of companies have mapped roads but no one has mapped sidewalks.\u201d \n \nThe navigation is done by artificial intelligence, and the bots are \u201c99 percent autonomous,\u201d according to the spokesman. \n \n\u201cWe want a human being able to oversee the robot\u2019s journey and to intervene whenever there is a problem,\u201d he said. \n \nHarris-Burland said the company\u2019s tests so far in Europe have shown the system works, with no problems related to theft or vandalism. \n \nThe lids of the devices are locked until the customer opens it with a smartphone. If anyone tries to steal it, an alarm will sound, and if it is hijacked the company can track it \u201cto the nearest inch,\u201d he said. \n \n© 2017 AFP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Robotics news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"New wave of robots set to deliver the goods","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Standerton Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"534543046","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Standerton Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://standertonadvertiser.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194842411","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He would love to have a secret to keep close to the vest, or a process he could explain. \n \nBut after another third quarter explosion \u2014 25 points as the Warriors wiped the Oracle Arena hardwood with the visiting Chris Paul-less Clippers 144-98 \u2014 Curry had no enlightened answer for his third-quarter turn-ups. \n \nIt was the 17th time in his career he scored at least 20 points in a quarter. Many of those are in the third quarter. Saturday, he made 8 of 11 from the field, including five 3-pointers, to go with six rebounds and three assists. He outscored the Clippers by himself as the Warriors turned a comfortable lead into a national embarrassment for Los Angeles. \n \nThe unique part about this latest big quarter: it was planned. \n \nUsually, Curry\u2019s barrages happen organically. They are about feel and rhythm, not strategy and situation. They tend to come out of nowhere, and only those who have experience playing with Curry can sense them coming, like that neighbor who can always feel the storm coming. \n \nSaturday, the Warriors ran a play for Curry to start the third quarter. They never do that. He prefers it that way, too, as he\u2019d rather get a few trips up and down the court before shooting. \n \nBut Curry had made his last two threes. He punctuated the first half with a 51-footer straight down the middle, drilling it at the buzzer as the crowd erupted. Then after airplaning in a circle, he was drilled by Draymond Green as the two leaped into each other. Curry ended up on the hardwood. \n \nSo Kerr looked to get Curry going in the third, coax an explosion. Kevin Durant brought the ball up, and after a couple passes, got it back in the post. Curry curled off a designed double screen and stuck a free throw line jumper. \n \n\u201cIt was just amazing to watch,\u201d Draymond Green said. \u201cLike you said, I\u2019ve seen him do some pretty incredible things. You can kind of see when he\u2019s going into one of those modes. I think it started with two shots, the half-court shot and then once he came out and he hit that first pull-up in the third quarter, you could kind of see it was about to be one of those type of nights.\u201d \n \nThe nation it knew it when, on a fast break, Curry pulled it from the E on the Oracle decal, about 30 feet from the rim. The next time down, he hoisted one in a blink from 28 feet. The next time down, with Durant looking to feed Curry exclusively, a back-door cut led to a reverse layup that left Durant shaking his head in disbelief. \n \nWhat is it about Curry and third quarters? What we do know: it isn\u2019t new. The trend began under coach Mark Jackson. He remembers that vividly. \n \n\u201cThe playoffs. Game 4,\u201d Curry said. \u201cThat was wild. It was my first playoffs. And I was hurt.\u201d \n \nHe is talking about the first round series against Denver. The Warriors were up 2-1 after stealing Game 2 in Denver and hanging on for dear life in Game 3. Their 12-point lead was down to four midway through the third quarter. Control of the series was slipping away. Then Curry, playing on a sprained left ankle, went off. \n \nHe shot a 3-pointer from the left corner and turned to look at the Nuggets bench while it was still in the air. Two minutes later, another 3 followed by a layup in traffic. The next eight points came at the expense of Andre Miller. A pull-up 3-pointer during a frenetic fast break left Oracle blown away. \n \nCurry had 22 points in that third quarter. The Warriors won by 14. He did it again in the third quarter of Game 6 as the Warriors clinched the first-round upset. He had 22 in the third quarter of Game 1 against the Spurs. A trend was born. \n \nHe had 28 in the third quarter in Charlotte last season, after honoring his father at halftime of Dell Curry Night. He had 26 of his 51 points in the quarter of a win at Dallas in February 2015. He had 28 in the third quarter at New Orleans on Halloween. \n \nUnder Steve Kerr, Curry does most of his damage in the third quarter (the first is not far behind). Since the beginning of last season, Curry is averaging 9.6 points in the third quarter. James Harden is second in the NBA during that span at 8.5. \n \nHe has made 283 3-pointers in the third quarter under Kerr, nearly a third of his total. \n \n\u201cYou know it\u2019s on when he hits one from deep,\u201d Andre Iguodala said. \u201cOnce those start dropping, it\u2019s over.\u201d \n \nThere are some unofficial explanations for Curry\u2019s third quarters. He looks to be more aggressive in the third quarter after looking to get others involved the first half. He wears opponents\u2019 down in the third quarter, a nod to his stamina as he gets stronger while defenses might fall off. His teammates look for him more in the third quarters as the defenses take away other options. \n \nAnother: Curry makes mental adjustments at the half. After getting a feel for how he\u2019s being defended, the counter punches come in the second half. \n \nNone of these make Curry say \u201cthat\u2019s it.\u201d He nodded at a couple, acknowledging that could be the reason some of the time. Others, he shook his head like it\u2019s not even factor. One last explanation got his attention. \n \nIs there something about the having the opportunity to put the opponent away? \n \n\u201cThat definitely has something to do with it,\u201d said Curry, who leads the NBA at plus-276 in the third quarter so far this season. \u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s in that space where we create some separation or if we let them back in it, now it\u2019s a close game.\u201d \n \nCurry feeds off moments. And when it calls for him to carry the load \u2014 whether because the team is struggling or the opponent is on the ropes \u2014 he gets more aggressive looking for his shot. Curry in attack mode is a problem for the defense because it must be on point to stay with him. Few defenses are good enough to maintain and eventually, he gets the good looks he needs. \n \nAnd because the Warriors have been such a dominant regular season game, two or three 3-pointers from Curry is usually a knockout punch late in the third quarter. \n \nLast season, he played 60 fourth quarters in his 80 games. The Warriors have 35 games remaining this season. Saturday was already the 15th time Curry did not play the fourth quarter. After another third quarter explosion, the Warriors were up 43. \n \n ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Marcus Thompson II"},"topics":[{"name":"Stockwatch","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Warriors embarrass Clippers with Stephen Curry latest third quarter gem","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Santa Clara","zipCode":"95190","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"San Jose","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Mercury News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"612493220","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3103"},"name":"The Mercury News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mercurynews.com/","publisher":"San Jose Mercury News"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194843824","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:07Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sjm-warriors-0129-11.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The team nearly matched the R/F Facility record of 63 percent from the floor. The Wolves, who didn't miss a free throw until late in the game, were 12-for-15 from the line.\n\nNorthern coach Curt Fredrickson said the high shooting percentage on Saturday makes up for a few years of struggles.\n\n\"If you take that shooting percentage and divide it by three, that's about what we've shot the last three times here,\" he said. \"So this gym owed us one.\"\n\nNorthern led from start to finish was a Miranda Ristau layup 10 seconds into the game began the scoring. Ristau finished with 12 points, despite playing just 18 minutes.\n\nJill Conrad finished with her fourth double-double of the season. She missed just one shot in the game to finish with a team-high 16 points to go along with 10 assists. As a team Northern had a season-high 23 assists.\n\nFredrickson said Conrad is a great weapon against a zone defense.\n\n\"Jill Conrad against the zone is the best forward in the league at the free-throw line,\" Fredrickson said. \"I don't know that there is anybody better. That is what makes things go for us against the zone defense. You put Conrad at the free-throw line and now that forces somebody to guard her.\"\n\nThat movement leaves Ristau at the low post with just one defender to beat. The simple play opened up a few baskets for the Northern center.\n\nFredrickson said the Mustang defense was also confused by some of the cuts made by Northern players.\n\n\"We got a lot of easy baskets, particularly in the first half of this game,\" he said. \"But we can't play any better. We shot the eyes out of it (Saturday). We were up against the zone defense all night and only shot seven 3s.\"\n\nWith a large lead most of the game, the Wolves rotated players frequently. All 12 players saw at least 9 minutes on the court. Eleven of them scored. Brianna Kusler, the only Northern player not to score, made up for it with a team-high seven rebounds.\n\n\"Everybody got a nice chance to play,\" Fredrickson said. \"Jaycie Gerding came in a popped a couple in just like nothing. That was good to see. Brianna didn't get a lot of shots out front. Gabby (Laimer) got a couple 3s, but they ran things pretty well and took care of the basketball.\"\n\nNorthern used a 12-0 run in the middle of the first quarter to grow an 8-5 lead to 20-5 over a 5 minute period.\n\nMidway through the second quarter, Gerding would give the Wolves a 42-20 lead when she hit a 3-pointer. The 20-point margin would remain through the first half with the Wolves up 52-24 at the break.\n\nSouthwest Minnesota played its best quarter in the third and was able to cut the lead to as few as 27 points, but it was never really a game in the second half.\n\nUp next for Northern State is a two-weekend homestand. The Wolves will first host Upper Iowa and Winona State. Friday's game will tip off at 6 p.m. with a 4 p.m. started planned for Saturday.\n\n\"Hopefully this game gives us some good momentum heading into next weekend,\" Fredrickson said. \"Those are two big games for us next weekend.

It\u2019s hard to get up and about. I\u2019ve been feeling kind of down, but I know I\u2019m getting old and I just have to live with it.\u201d \n   \nThis fatalistic stance relies on mistaken assumptions about what constitutes aging. \n   \nIn fact, fatigue, weakness and depression aren\u2019t to-be-expected consequences of growing older, said Callahan, director of the Center for Aging Research at Indiana University\u2019s School of Medicine. \n   \nInstead, they\u2019re a signal that something is wrong and a medical evaluation is in order. \n   \n\u201cPeople have a perception ... that aging equals decline,\u201d said Jeanne Wei, a geriatrician who directs the Donald W. Reynolds Institute on Aging at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. \u201cThat\u2019s just wrong.\u201d \n   \nOf course, peoples\u2019 bodies do change as they get on in years, but this is a gradual process. If you suddenly find your thinking is cloudy and your memory unreliable, if you\u2019re overcome by dizziness and your balance is out of whack, if you find yourself tossing and turning at night and running urgently to the bathroom, don\u2019t chalk it up to normal aging. \n   \nGo see your physician. The earlier you identify and deal with these problems, the better. \n   \nHere are four common concerns that should spark attention. \n  \n Fatigue: You have no energy  \n  \nDon\u2019t underestimate the impact: Chronically weary older adults are at risk of losing their independence and becoming socially isolated. \n   \nNearly one-third of people age 51 and older experience fatigue, according to a 2010 study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. (Other estimates are lower.) \n   \nThere are plenty of potential culprits: Sleep problems, pain, gastrointestinal reflux and medications for blood pressure can induce fatigue, as can infections, arthritis, an underactive thyroid, poor nutrition and alcohol use. \n   \nAll can be addressed, doctors said. Perhaps most important is ensuring that older adults remain physically active. \n   \n\u201cIf someone comes into my office walking at a snail\u2019s pace and tells me, \u2018I\u2019m old; I\u2019m just slowing down,\u2019 I\u2019m, like, \u2018No, that isn\u2019t right,\u2019\u2009\u201d said Lee Ann Lindquist, a professor of geriatrics at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. \n  \n Loss of appetite  \n  \nThis puts you at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies and frailty, and it raises the prospect of an earlier-than-expected death. Between 15 and 30 percent of older adults are believed to have what\u2019s known as the \u201canorexia of aging.\u201d \n   \nPhysical changes associated with aging \u2014 notably declines in vision, taste and smell, all of which make food attractive \u2014 can contribute. So can other conditions: decreased saliva production (a medication-induced problem that affects about one-third of older adults); constipation (affecting up to 40 percent of seniors); social isolation (people don\u2019t like to eat alone); dental problems; and illnesses and infections. \n  \n Depression  \n  \nDepression in later life can have profound consequences, compounding the effects of chronic illnesses such as heart disease, leading to disability, affecting cognition and, in extreme cases, resulting in suicide. \n   \nOnce, it was believed \u201cmelancholia\u201d was common in later life and that seniors withdrew from the world as they realized that their days were limited, Callahan explained. Since then, researchers have shown that older adults tend to be happier than other age groups: Only 15 percent have major depression or minor variants. \n   \nLate-life depression is typically associated with a serious illness such as diabetes, cancer, arthritis or stroke; deteriorating hearing or vision; and life changes such as retirement or the loss of a spouse. \n  \n Weakness  \n  \nYou may have sarcopenia \u2014 a notable loss of muscle mass and strength that affects about 10 percent of adults older than 60. If untreated, sarcopenia will affect your balance, mobility and stamina, and raise the risk of falling, becoming frail and losing independence. \n   \nAge-related muscle atrophy, which begins when people reach their 40s and accelerates when they\u2019re in their 70s, is part of the problem. Muscle strength declines even more rapidly \u2014 slipping about 15 percent per decade starting around age 50. \n   \nThe solution: exercise, including resistance and strength training exercises, and good nutrition, including getting adequate amounts of protein. \n   \nWatch for sudden changes. \u201cIf you\u2019re not as strong as you were yesterday, that\u2019s not right,\u201d Wei said. \n   \nTaking steps to address weakness doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll have the same strength and endurance as when you were in your 20s or 30s. But it may mean that doctors catch a serious or preventable problem early and forestall further decline.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Judith Graham Kaiser Health News"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Tired and weak?

Having owned an organic gardening operation in the 1980s, she left the business but later returned to grow into another branch of gardening. \n   \nShe now owns Pleu Gardens, which sells starts, transplants and flower bouquets at the Tulsa, Okla., Farmers Markets. With spring just a few months away, she is already in the throes of overseeing the growth of dozens of varieties of cool-weather vegetable plants, including broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower. \n   \n\u201cThere\u2019s so much to do with timing of when to start planting your seeds,\u201d Pleu said. \n   \nBecause she is sowing seeds and raising plants with a commercial intent, she works a few weeks ahead of the home gardeners\u2019 planting schedule. She shared several tips to help gardeners successfully grow plants from seeds and transplant to pots or plots and to enjoy the plants this spring. \n  \n Start simple  \n  \nMany plants are easy to grow from seeds. Tomatoes are popular with gardeners of varying experience. They do well in pots or in the ground, and there are so many varieties from which to choose, from cherry tomatoes to heirloom Cherokee Purples. \n   \nA few other easy-to-grow seeds include eggplant, basil, squash and cucumbers. These plants require less maintenance or attention to start and raise into mature plants. \n  \n Use a calendar/journal  \n  \nPleu has been using a journal to record dates when seeds are sown, notes about which plants she\u2019s growing and when they\u2019re transplanted to their permanent place. \n   \nThen throughout the season, she jots down details about harvests, locations and other things she might find useful for the following year\u2019s planting. \n  \n Get organized  \n  \nWhen you\u2019re ready to start planting your seeds, pull together your materials and tools, including trays/containers, growing medium/potting soil, labels/popsicle sticks and seeds. Pleu said it can be easy to forget which seeds you just planted or which label belongs to which row of seeds. Plant one seed at a time and label the row as soon as you\u2019re done. \n  \n Water carefully  \n  \nIt\u2019s important to maintain moisture in the growing medium because the seeds may die if they dry out after they\u2019re sown. However, watering too much can cause the seeds to take on a disease called damping-off, which happens when the seeds become too wet and won\u2019t emerge from the soil. \n   \nUse a digital thermometer to check the temperature of the soil to help the seeds germinate. \n  \n Be creative  \n  \nIt\u2019s easy to get carried away buying trays and containers for starting seeds, but Pleu pointed out that old plastic containers missing lids can be used at no cost. Also, plastic cling wrap can be used in lieu of the plastic domes.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jessica Rodrigo BH Media"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Tips for planting seeds for spring plants","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Guilford","zipCode":"27401","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Greensboro","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News-Record.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675145","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"752"},"name":"News-Record.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news-record.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194847688","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/greensboro.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/59/b59eecea-6c3b-53ec-9d1b-2d952a26f48c/58891c94e7e7b.image.jpg?resize=300%2C216"}],"video":[]}}

However, they are also ready to share food with other animals during complex situations, a new study found.\n\nThe study found that dogs exhibit pro-social behaviour and they clearly showed a preference for sharing the food reward with another familiar dog, whereas unfamiliar dogs were rewarded nearly three times less often than the familiar ones.\n\nThe higher level of complexity, however, impacted the general frequency of the food delivery, Rachel Dale from the University of Veterinary Medicine - Vienna in Austria, said in a statement.\n\nIn addition, the presence of a partner was found to make dogs more likely to share their food.\n\nIn the study, the researchers tested whether it made a difference to the donor dog if the receiver was familiar or a stranger.\n\nWhen a second dog was present in the testing room without being in the other enclosure, the donor dogs were more motivated to give a food reward. When the test dogs were alone in the room, the number of food deliveries went down, the researchers mentioned.\n\nThis aspect, known as social facilitation, starts from the assumption that animals will perform more readily in the presence of conspecifics.\n\nThe presence of a partner appears to play a greater role. In this case too, the donor dogs preferred familiar partners, the researchers said.\n\n\"The difference was smaller, however, than when there was direct visual contact.

The person was astonished at the cost of gluten-free bread versus a loaf of wheat or white bread. \n   \nSpecial dietary restrictions can be more costly, but there are ways to save. \n   \nA loaf of premium gluten bread costs about $3 on sale, but gluten-free Udi bread runs about $9 on sale. \n   \nRegistering for a gluten-free brand\u2019s e-newsletter or e-club is a great first step. Then contact the various companies and ask, \u201cDo you have any coupons for your products?\u201d \n   \nThere is no need to gush over or complain about their products, which you may have never tried, just to get coupons. Of course, if you do have an honest opinion after trying the products, share that. If you haven\u2019t tried them yet, be honest and just ask if any are available. Look on their websites, in the Sunday News & Record and on in-store displays. \n   \nStockpile the special items more than you would with non-specialty foods. For example, gluten-free pasta and flour will go on sale less often than gluten varieties. That means instead of buying only a month\u2019s worth of pasta, a gluten-free family may need to buy enough for three months when the sale price hits rock bottom. \n   \nYou may find some of the better deals online. Amazon, VitaCost.com and DirectEats.com are three sites that routinely have good prices for gluten-free selections. Often they offer free shipping with a spending threshold of $25 to $50. This can be a good way to quickly stock up on gluten-free products. \n   \nThe most expensive products are those that have to be processed, like bread and pasta. But fruit, vegetables, eggs, rice and beans are usually naturally gluten-free. \n   \nAvoiding the processed food and going with the naturally gluten free will save money, and the products are often healthier. Look for options that offer the same flavor or texture but are naturally gluten-free. \n   \nTry using gluten-free tortillas instead of sandwich bread. Skip the pricey gluten-free pasta and make spaghetti squash or zucchini noodles. Make fried chicken with almond meal instead of flour. \n   \nDietary changes can often be a shocker to the taste buds, stomach and the budget. It may take a little extra time, effort and adjustment to bring the grocery budget under control. But there is no need to pay full price for specialty food.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Forex markets news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Stretching a Dollar: Gluten-free diets don't have to wreck grocery budget","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Guilford","zipCode":"27401","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Greensboro","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News-Record.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675145","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"752"},"name":"News-Record.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news-record.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://VitaCost.com/","http://DirectEats.com/"],"sequenceId":"695194848318","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Spokane hospital is the sole beneficiary of the Montana Shrine Game, and has benefitted over $2,500,000 in the game\u2019s history.\n\nThe 2016 game was held in Butte on the Montana Tech campus, with the West winning, 45-14. The East leads the all-time series 38-32.\n\nThe stop was the game's third in Butte since the game began rotating locations in 2010. The Montana Shrine Game has been one of the top performing games in the United States since beginning the rotation, donating over $700,000 in that span.\n\nEvents surrounding the 2016 game included: golf tournaments in Butte, Great Falls and Kalispell, a cheer camp, a screening clinic, a patient/player experience, a banquet, a high school athletic combine, a parade and a telethon.\n\n\u201cThe 2016 game was a great success,\u201d West coordinator Jeff Hartwick said. \u201cWe added some new events like the combine and telethon, which will continue to grow. The statewide golf tournaments are very successful.\n\n\"The game atmosphere at Montana Tech was incredible. Due to the work of game organizers and board members, and the generosity of the game sponsors, the 2016 game in Butte was one of the most successful games in the United States this year -- and one of the largest donations ever from the Montana Shrine Game.\n\n\u201cWe want to extend our appreciation to all the sponsors, fans, players, cheerleaders, coaches, family members, Shrine Hospital patients and representatives, the Shriners from all three temples in Montana, the board of directors, and the huge volunteer group that helped with every aspect of the event. It\u2019s a state-wide team event, and the success of this game is due to all of these groups.\u201d\n\nThe 71st annual Montana East-West Shrine Game will be played at Rocky Mountain College in Billings on July 15.\n\nHARTFORD, Conn.

The statue will be unveiled this season, although the date is not yet set.\n\nKelly led the Twins to World Series titles in 1987 and 1991. His record of 1,140-1,244 places him first on the Twins' managerial list in wins and games. Kelly retired after the 2001 season.

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n \nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen. Tashfeen Malik was from a family of wealthy landowners in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia with her immediate family. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a US citizen. \n \nPakistan and Saudi Arabia, however, are not on the list of countries subject to the new ban. \n \nThe administration is facing criticism from leaders in the U.S. and around the world for taking steps their critics say are unconstitutional and anti-American. \n \nThe second mention of San Bernardino came when the official was trying to explain why there was no grace period before the executive order went into effect, to help ease implementation. \n \n\"Imagine if this had been an executive order that had been contemplated the day before the San Bernardino shooter entered the United States?\" the official asked. \"Would have delaying its implementation served the best interests of the country? The reality is we don't know who the next individual is who will exploit our immigration programs successfully. If you choose that something is necessary to do for the sake of national security, it should be done immediately.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump official incorrectly justifies travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Duval","zipCode":"32207","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jacksonville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News4Jax.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658107","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"250"},"name":"News4Jax.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news4jax.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194850397","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The state\u2019s open government laws, requirements for recorded votes by the Legislature, campaign finance disclosure and competitive bidding reforms all date from the days of the Boren Broom Brigade. \n   \nIn 1979, he moved on to the U.S. Senate, where he was a consistent voice of moderation and compromise. Boren joked that while the Democrats sat on one side of the Senate aisle and the Republicans on the other, he sometimes felt the need to pull his desk into the aisle. \n   \nHe was consistently the most popular elected official in the state because he spoke not for party or for personal promotion, but for the people of Oklahoma. \n   \nOh, that there were a few more David Borens in the Senate today. \n   \nIn 1994, Boren left the Senate to become the 13th president of the University of Oklahoma, and, as remarkable as it may seem, he has managed to overshadow his record in elective office with his work in academic office. \n   \nUnder Boren\u2019s leadership, OU has gone through a golden era of physical and academic rebuilding. The university has initiated more than 35 new programs and raised more than $2.5 billion in private gifts. The Norman campus has been rebuilt virtually from end to end. The number of endowed faculty positions has risen from 94 to 562. The number of private scholarships for students have quadrupled. And the school has consistently been among the top universities in the nation in recruiting National Merit Scholars. \n   \nIn Tulsa, Boren\u2019s leadership was critical in the establishment of the Schusterman campus and the School of Community Medicine, jointly built with the University of Tulsa. \n   \nDid we mention that he was a Rhodes Scholar? Or that he led the efforts to free Nelson Mandela?

It is a goal of the ICC that every Full Member plays international bilateral cricket in their own country. But for us to do that, we need everyone to be safe and secure,\" ESPNcricinfo quoted him as saying.\n\nPakistan have not hosted any international cricket tournaments since the terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore in 2009,when six Pakistani Policemen were killed and some of the visiting players were injured.\n\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was in talks with the MCC at the time for the latter to send a cricket team to Lahore, but the terror attack put an end to that.\n\n\"We don't want to get it wrong,\" Clarke said. \"We all know one terrible incident can push things backwards again. What happened here in one of Lahore's parks did make it impossible for us to send a team here last year. So we're hoping to move forward, but this isn't an easy road.\"\n\nThe ICC official further said that there's a considerable amount of perception that needs to be changed and information that needs to be shared.\n\n\"But I am most impressed by the efforts of the authorities to make Lahore a safe city,\" he asserted.\n\nThe Federation of International Cricketers Associations (FICA) has earlier this month advised players not to tour Pakistan due to an extremely elevated state of insecurity in the country.\n\nThe cricket federation, citing unnamed security consultants, had termed Pakistan as an unsafe place to play cricket.\n\nHowever, Clarke didn't comment on that statement, saying he hadn't discussed that statement with FICA, or read it in full.\n\n\"I was far more interested in coming here for myself before I opened that conversation,\" he said.\n\nThe West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) had also this month rejected the proposed tour to Pakistan after the security concerns raised by FICA.

I read that as your body ages, it makes less of this natural sleep substance. \n   \nI try to avoid sleeping pills. The TV commercials for such medications scare me when they describe horrible side effects. \n   \nI recently read the fine print on my melatonin bottle. It said take it for two months, then wait a week before taking it again. \n   \nI can do this, but I don\u2019t want to take sleeping pills while I am off melatonin. I do not need anything that makes my memory worse, which is what I fear from the help-you-sleep stuff advertised on TV. At age 85, I\u2019d like to stay safe. Is there a problem taking melatonin? \n   \nA: We appreciate your concerns. Many over-the-counter sleeping pills contain DPH or other sedating antihistamines. A study in JAMA Internal Medicine (March 2015) linked regular use of first-generation antihistamines like diphenhydramine (DPH) and other anticholinergic drugs to dementia. Some prescription sleeping pills also have been associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline (Expert Opinion on Drug Safety, May 2015) . \n   \nAlthough melatonin usually is considered safe (Clinical Drug Investigations, March 2016) , a British study recently found that older people taking melatonin are at a greater risk for fracture (Age and Ageing, November 2016). \n   \nThat may be because of dizziness or a morning \u201changover\u201d effect. An alternate approach to overcoming insomnia without side effects is cognitive behavioral therapy. \n   \nQ: I took simvastatin for many years to control my cholesterol. Soon after I started taking it, I received a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes. I don\u2019t know if there is a connection. \n   \nAbout six months ago, I stopped taking simvastatin; my hips and knees no longer hurt. My latest lab results show an increase in LDL to a bit over standard range. HDL is OK. \n   \nI also had experienced sexual problems, but I attributed those to the paroxetine I took for depression. I stopped taking the paroxetine about two months ago, and the sexual difficulties have completely disappeared. I feel much better after eliminating both drugs. \n   \nA: Simvastatin can raise blood sugar and make people more prone to Type 2 diabetes. A fascinating study showed that people taking a different statin, pravastatin, together with paroxetine had elevated blood-glucose levels not caused by either drug alone (Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, July 2011). \n   \nNow that you have stopped the medications, you might be able to control your blood sugar with natural approaches .

My solution is to have my physician take my blood pressure after the exam rather than before. That way, I have time to relax and get through the exam. My blood pressure usually is fine, whereas at the start of the visit it is often elevated. \n   \nA:Your approach is sensible. Perhaps others will benefit from your experience .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Joe and Teresa Graedon King Features"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"People's Pharmacy: Is melatonin too risky for older insomniacs?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Guilford","zipCode":"27401","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Greensboro","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News-Record.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169675145","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"752"},"name":"News-Record.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news-record.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.peoplespharmacy.com/"],"sequenceId":"695194855055","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If a player is a citizen of one of the banned countries, he would need to obtain a \"case-by-case waiver\" in order to be able to re-enter the US. \n \nOfficials at the Department of Homeland Security stated that, in order to qualify for the waiver, the situation must be \"in the national interest\". \n \nMaker, who was born in what is now South Sudan, is in a somewhat confusing situation. \n \nSudan, not South Sudan, is on the list of banned countries but, when Maker was born, his country of birth was considered the former. It was only in 2011 when South Sudan gained its independence from Sudan. \n \nMaker's passport, which is Australian, was observed by foxsports.com.au in 2016, and lists his birth place as Wau, which is now a city in South Sudan. If the State Department considers Wau as part of South Sudan, then the seven-footer isn't expected to be affected, though that has yet to be confirmed. \n \nOn Friday evening, just hours after the order was put into place, Maker was able to travel from Canada to the US without incident, though it's not known whether that was because the order was still in its infancy at the time, or whether that's the ongoing policy of the Trump administration. \n \nThis scenario would also be the case for Thon's younger brother, Matur, who's currently playing high school basketball in Canada. \n \nLuol Deng, the Los Angeles Lakers forward, was also born in Wau, and holds dual citizenship with the United Kingdom. \n \nSome of Australia's South Sudanese athletes playing college basketball are also likely to be unaffected by the ban. Louisville's Deng Adel was born in Juba, South Sudan, while Mangok Mathiang, also a Louisville Cardinal, is known to have been born in a city that's now a part of the Republic of South Sudan. \n \nOne athlete that may be affected by the ban is the University of Kentucky's Wenyen Gabriel, who was born in Khartoum, Sudan. If he were to leave the US, he wouldn't be able to immediately re-enter, unless he obtained a special waiver, which currently has an ambiguous qualification process. \n \nOn Saturday, a federal judge blocked a portion of the President's order, ordering that those trapped in airports and transit stations across the US should not be sent back to their home country. The judge stopped short of allowing those people into the US. \n \nThe NBA released a statement on Saturday saying: \"We have reached out to the State Department and are in the process of gathering information to understand how this executive order would apply to players in our league who are from one of the impacted countries. The NBA is a global league and we are proud to attract the very best players from around the world.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"South Sudan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"How Trump's immigration order could affect...","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Ipswich Satellite","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662719","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"Ipswich Satellite","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thesatellite.com.au","publisher":"APN Holdings NZ Limited"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194855830","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Nor should you have been. \n\nSeattle could save $10   million against its salary cap for 2017 by releasing the 30-year-old before his $2   million roster bonus comes due in March. \n\nHere\u2019s why that\u2019s not going to happen: \n\n▪  The team isn\u2019t as strapped for cap room as it has been entering previous offseasons. The Seahawks have an estimated $32.9   million in space under their $170   million salary cap for 2017. \n\n▪  Seattle\u2019s offense has yet to have Graham free from the effects of injury for an entire season. \n\n▪  Most of all, even when the Seahawks have had him healthy, they haven\u2019t used him for the reason they got him. \n\nIt\u2019s not that Graham hasn\u2019t been the 80- or 90-catch guy he was with Drew Brees and the Saints. He never was going to be that in Seattle\u2019s offense. He\u2019s been getting a fraction of the targets he got in New Orleans. And the Seahawks have run the ball the last two seasons with Graham 107 more times (904 total rushes in 2015-16) than New Orleans did its last two seasons with him and Brees together. \n\nSeattle traded two-time Pro Bowl center Max Unger and a first-round draft choice to New Orleans in March 2015 to get Graham, specifically to fix its problems in the red zone. \n\nThe Seahawks ranked 20th in the NFL in scoring touchdowns inside the opponents\u2019 20-yard line the season before the trade, a rate of 51.5 percent. \n\nBut two seasons later, Graham\u2019s still lacking the requisite opportunities to truly make a difference around the goal line. \n\nIn 2015, when Graham played 11 games before suffering a season-ending knee injury in late November, the Seahawks were 16th in red-zone TD scoring, at 55.6 percent. \n\nIn 2016, they sank to 25th, scoring touchdowns just 47.6 percent of the time while inside the opponents\u2019 20. \n\nYes, even though Graham set Seahawks records for tight ends with 65 catches and 923 yards this past season, Seattle\u2019s offense was 4 percentage points worse in red-zone efficiency than in the 2014 season that prompted them to trade for him. \n\nWhy? \n\nThey simply haven\u2019t used Graham enough near the goal line. \n\nIn 2015, Wilson was still seeking chemistry with his new tight end. Wide receiver Doug Baldwin shared the NFL lead with a Seahawks-record 14 touchdown catches. Marshawn Lynch was still the lead runner and team\u2019s identity, just before his injuries and eventual retirement. And Graham was not used to breaking off his routes to match Wilson\u2019s improvisational scrambles. \n\nThe result: Seattle targeted Graham in the red zone nine times in 11 games in 2015, netting three receptions, one touchdown (of 1 yard, in his first Seahawks game, at St. Louis in September 2015) and one interception. Wilson had a passer rating of 39.8 when targeting Graham inside the 20 that season. Graham\u2019s two touchdown catches overall that year were a career low. \n\nFamiliarity in year two should have spawned red-zone success. But Graham\u2019s rehabilitation from surgery for his torn patellar tendon lasted into September. Wilson didn\u2019t throw to him in the red zone until the third game, against San Francisco. The \u201ccrazy special,\u201d two-touchdown night against Buffalo Nov.   7 \u2014 when he caught passes one-handed in the end zone while a defender was holding his other arm \u2014 showed what a weapon Graham is near the goal line. \n\n\u201cBad man!\u201d a smiling Wilson yelled as Graham talked in the locker room after that game, one of the few times the tight end spoke to the media this past season. \n\nBut those were as many red-zone scores as Graham had in the final seven games combined. \n\nThe Seahawks\u2019 most alarming example of not using Graham was on Christmas Eve. Needing a win at home over the sub-.500 Cardinals to help secure the No.   2 seed in the NFC playoffs, the Seahawks did not score on 12 consecutive snaps inside the Arizona 19. Graham was not targeted on any of those dozen red-zone plays. \n\nSeattle lost that day. That\u2019s the reason its divisional-round playoff game was at the Georgia Dome, where they lost to the frenzied Falcons instead of hosting them at CenturyLink Field. \n\nIn 18 games this past season, including the two in the postseason, Seattle targeted Graham in the red zone 22 times. He caught 10 of those passes for 112 yards and five touchdowns. \n\nOver his first two seasons with the Seahawks, 29 games, they are 13 for 31 throwing to Graham in the red zone for 120 yards, six touchdowns, one interception and a passer rating of 79.3. \n\nThey absolutely did not trade for Graham to be throw to him so sporadically inside the 20. \n\nBut Carroll sounded optimistic about Graham\u2019s 2017 last week while assessing his 2016. \n\n\u201cI thought Jimmy had a terrific year,\u201d the coach said. \u201cHe was explosive. He was dynamic. He blocked like he\u2019s never blocked before. He became a factor on the perimeter blocking stuff, and he\u2019s a highlight film. He\u2019s got so many big plays that he made during the year. \n\n\u201cEvery receiver could always catch more balls, you know. \u2026 So I\u2019m excited for him to come back. \n\n\u201cImagine how much better he\u2019ll feel. Look what he had to undergo last offseason to get back and be in the phenomenal shape that he was. This will allow him to come back again. He should be stronger this year and more fit this year. He\u2019s got a great work ethic about him. He\u2019s naturally built and physiqued and all that, so I think nothing but really cool stuff for us as we go forward.\u201d \n\nCarroll said he and general manager John Schneider are well aware Graham is entering the final year of the four-year, $40   million contract he signed with the Saints before the trade. It\u2019s scheduled to pay him $7.9   million in non-guaranteed base salary, fifth-highest on the Seahawks in 2017. He will get a $2   million bonus if he is on Seattle\u2019s roster March 11, the third day of the 2017 league year. \n\nThe Seahawks could offer Graham a multiyear extension with guaranteed money and a more team-friendly cap number for this coming year. \n\nMore likely, because they aren\u2019t pinched right now against the cap, they will let Graham play out the final season of his deal knowing he would be extremely motivated to earn one more big contract after he turns 31 in November. If he gets a better deal elsewhere for 2018 and beyond, Seattle might receive a compensatory choice in the top half of the 2019 draft for losing him to unrestricted free agency in March 2018. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking at all of those,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cWe know this area, and they\u2019re in their last year, too. We know how that\u2019s going and those conversations come up when we can get to them. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you reminded us, but John is on that.\u201d \n\nAll that means it makes little sense \u2014 financial or common \u2014 for the Seahawks to shed Graham before they\u2019ve fully used him in the way they intended when they got him. \n\nYes, to use him more in the red zone. \nEXTRA POINT  \nStarting cornerback DeShawn Shead posted on Twitter that he had successful surgery to reconstruct the anterior cruciate ligament injury in his left knee suffered in the playoff loss at Atlanta on Jan. 14. \u201cSurgery went really well with great results! Will be back playing with my bros and for the 12s sooner than later! #LOB\u201d Shead wrote. The Seahawks say it may be into the 2017 season before he returns. He is a scheduled to become a restricted free agent in March.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Gregg Bellgbell@thenewstribune.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Why it\u2019s probable that we haven\u2019t seen the last of Graham","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Thurston","zipCode":"98501","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Olympia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bellingham Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658696","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1606"},"name":"Bellingham Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["AmericanFootball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bellinghamherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194856184","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:43Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The chance to prove he deserves regular duty in the big leagues. \n\n\u201cI worked a long time and real hard for this,\u201d he said, \u201cso I\u2019ll try to take nothing for granted, but I\u2019m looking forward to spring training. For me, it\u2019s all about competing and trying to win a job. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking too far ahead. I\u2019m just hoping to get to Arizona early and to get after it.\u201d \n\nThe Mariners see Haniger, 26, as the answer to their need for a right-handed power bat in what has been a lefty-heavy lineup. He was a key component in the November deal with Arizona that also netted shortstop Jean Segura. \n\n\u201cBy the numbers,\u201d general manager Jerry Dipoto said, \u201c(Haniger) was able to show that he was the best offensive player (last year) in the minor leagues at any level.\u201d \n\nDipoto made it clear earlier this week that when spring training opens next month, right field is Haniger\u2019s job to lose. Two other rookies, Ben Gamel and Guillermo Heredia , are projected to battle for duty as an outfield reserve. \n\n\u201cMitch is probably the more developed and polished,\u201d Dipoto said. \u201cHe\u2019s also a right-handed batter, and we acquired him for that reason. Mitch is also the one that brings with him a skill set that includes power, and he\u2019s got on-base ability.\u201d \n\nIf Haniger stumbles, he has options available and could wind up at Triple-A Tacoma. But the Mariners believe \u2014 as does Haniger \u2014 that his career trajectory, which he redirected two years ago, points to a bright future. \n\nAbout that change\u2026 \n\nHaniger was still new at the time to the Arizona organization, having been acquired the previous year at the July 31 trade deadline, and he found himself facing a demotion to High-A after spending the previous year at Double-A. \n\n\u201cI started working on (my swing) before that happened,\" he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t playing as much as I\u2019d like in Double-A, so I asked to go down. I said I wanted to play, and they said, \u2018Well, we have a lot of guys here.\u2019   \u201d \n\nThat could have been a jolt. \n\nHaniger was a first-round pick in 2012 and started the 2014 season ranked as the No. 3 prospect in the Milwaukee organization before getting rerouted to the Diamondbacks. Now he was taking a step back. \n\nRather than pout, Haniger embraced the move as an opportunity to rework his swing by playing every day at High-A Visalia. \n\n\u201cA ton of different things but mostly swing plane,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI changed how I thought about mechanics. I read a lot of articles about different mechanical philosophies and (tried to determine) what makes the most sense for me.\u201d \n\nHaniger locked in on Toronto third baseman Josh Donaldson and Arizona center fielder A.J. Pollock \u2014 two players who are similar in build to the 210 pounds on his 6-foot-2 frame. \n\n\u201cI studied mostly right-handed hitters because that\u2019s what I am,\u201d Haniger said. \u201cI studied lefties, too, but for the most part, it was right-handed guys who aren\u2019t ginormous in size but who produce a lot of power. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I felt like I hadn\u2019t been able to tap into.\u201d \n\nProgress came immediately but in slow bites. Even so, by late June, Haniger was back at Double-A Mobile and finished the season by posting a .310/.368/.515 (batting average/on-base percentage/slugging percentage) slash in 104 games. \n\nAll three numbers were, easily, the best in his career. \n\n\u201cThen in the offseason before last year,\u201d Haniger said, \u201cI got even more technical, and I started focusing on my upper half more instead of my lower half. A combination of the two really opened up (my potential).\u201d \n\nAfter a strong start last season at Mobile, Haniger reached Triple-A Reno in early June. His roll not only continued, it accelerated; he posted a .341/.428/.670 slash for the Aces in 74 games. \n\nOverall, Haniger again set career highs in all three slash numbers at .321/.419/.581. He also set career highs with 25 homers and 94 RBIs and, by mid-August, he was in the big leagues. \n\n\u201cWith plenty of raw power, good bat speed and now an efficient swing,\u201d Baseball America reported, \u201cHaniger makes consistent hard contact at the plate.\u201d \n\nHaniger flashed potential in 34 big-league games by producing five homers and 17 RBIs despite batting .229. Defensively, he graded out well in most advanced metrics. Nonetheless, his overall self-assessment was harsh. \n\n\u201cI think I really underperformed,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019m capable of a lot more than I showed. I think I learned a lot. I think that was a great experience, and in this off-season, I tried to fix some of the stuff that I want to get better at.\u201d \n\nAnd now, opportunity awaits. \n\n\u201cInitially, I was just really shocked (by the trade),\u201d Haniger admitted. \u201cThe timing. It was the night before Thanksgiving. I had a voicemail notification from (general manager) Mike Hazen of the D-Backs\u2019 organization. \n\n\u201cSo I called him back, and from the tone of his voice, I knew something was up. He told me, and I was just shocked at first. Then once I started thinking about everything, I got really excited and felt fortunate. It\u2019s going to be good.\u201d \nMLB DRAFT BONUS POOL  \nThe Mariners will have $6,415,400 to spend this year on their first 10 picks in the MLB Draft with nearly half of that \u2014 $3,174,200 \u2014 resulting from the slot value for having the No. 18 overall pick. \n\nMLB released the bonus pools and slot values earlier this week after all picks fell into place once the status clarified for all players who received qualifying offers. \n\nAll picks after the 10th round can receive up to a $100,000 bonus without affecting the bonus pool. Any amount over $125,000 for any player counts against the total pool. \n\nThe Draft is June 12-14. Clubs are permitted to exceed slot values for any player in the first 10 rounds but penalties are assessed for exceeding their overall allotted bonus pool. \n\nMinnesota has the first pick overall and the highest pool at $13,481,500. Cincinnati picks second and has the second-highest pool at $13,006,900. Cleveland has the smallest pool at $3,646,100. The Mariners\u2019 bonus pool ranks 21st. \n\nMariners FanFest \n \nWhere: SafecoField, Seattle. \n\nWhen: 11 a.m.-4 p.m. \n\nTickets: $10 for age 15 or older, free for age 14 or younger.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Bob Duttonbdutton@thenewstribune.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Haniger hopes he\u2019s found a home","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Thurston","zipCode":"98501","state":"Washington","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Olympia","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bellingham Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658696","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1606"},"name":"Bellingham Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bellinghamherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hanigmi01.shtml","http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/gamelbe01.shtml","http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/heredgu01.shtml"],"sequenceId":"695194856740","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:45Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He notes that he won in the end.\n\nNow the former Liberal, who left the party in 2014 after leaked emails revealed his disparaging and sexist comments about a female Sydney City councillor, is gunning for Nationals MP Michael Johnsen\u2019s seat of Upper Hunter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have some fun,\u201d said Mr Preston, 47, at Elderslie on Friday of his role as Shooters, Fishers and Farmers spokesman for the Hunter, and his run as party candidate against Mr Johnsen at the 2019 NSW election, despite not owning a gun.\n\nThe Upper Hunter is the first of what Shooters, Fishers and Farmers state director Filip Despotoski describes as \u201cwinnable\u201d NSW seats held by Nationals MPs that will be targeted by the party.\n\nIn the 2015 election Mr Johnsen suffered a 20 per cent swing against him after a strong showing by Country Labor candidate and Muswellbrook mayor Martin Rush, leaving the Nationals with a marginal seat after continuously holding the Upper Hunter since 1931.\n\nThe Shooters unveiled plans for the region a day before NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian travelled to Tamworth, and then to Queanbeyan on Sunday, as part of a campaign to \u201creconnect\u201d with regional NSW after the disastrous impact of the Baird Government\u2019s greyhound and council amalgamation decisions in the regions.\n\nMr Preston on Friday used \u201cscandalous\u201d Upper Hunter education figures to declare the seat had \u201cendured years of benign neglect\u201d under the Nationals.\n\n\u201cI looked at the education figures where you\u2019ve got more than 70 per cent of children in some schools in the bottom quarter of students in the state, and I thought \u2018This isn\u2019t bad, this is horrific\u2019,\u201d Mr Preston said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re being completely let down by the education system, the National Party and their local MP. These figures are nothing less than scandalous. That will be one of our highest priorities, to address the woeful education outcomes. If you repeated these Upper Hunter numbers in Sydney it would be viewed as some kind of emergency. That is going to stop. We are going to make it stop.\u201d\n\nMr Preston said he was moving to Muswellbrook from Sydney in February. He knew the area after project managing construction of Muswellbrook Fair shopping centre and managing it for several years from 2007. He grew up in the Cowra area, trained as an accountant and worked as a tax specialist in the 1990s.\n\nIt was during this time he was involved in landmark High Court cases dealing with state and territory excises \u2013 first involving X-rated films in a case against the ACT Government, and the second involving tobacco excises against the NSW Government.\n\nThe states and territories lost the second case in 1997, and overnight the basis on which they had levied excises of $4.9 billion a year on tobacco, alcohol and petrol ended. The Federal Government was forced to intervene, collect the funds and return them to the states. Within weeks the Federal Government was considering a report that concluded: \u201cThe present crisis may be the stimulus required to undertake major restructuring of the present pattern of consumption taxation.\u201d\n\nMr Preston confirmed that in 1996 he was arrested and charged with money laundering and conspiring to defraud the State of NSW of $7 million in excises based on his business of buying and selling cigarettes. He and six others were charged despite the earlier launch of the High Court case challenging the rights of the states to charge the tobacco excises.\n\nIn a Fairfax Media report of the controversial case, which included the bugging of Mr Preston\u2019s home, it was noted: \u201cWhen the High Court found the fees were in fact unlawful, the charges against Preston and the six others evaporated.\u201d \n\nMr Preston said it was \u201cnice to be at the centre of a seismic shift in Australian economic life. I\u2019m used to being around the big stuff\u201d.\n\nHe left the Liberal Party in 2014 after publicity about leaked emails between himself and the then Sydney City councillor Edward Mandla in which Mr Preston called a female councillor a \u201ccompany tart\u201d and an \u201cidiot\u201d.\n\nMr Preston was present at a meeting with Mr Mandla and Shooters, Fishers and Farmers MP Robert Borsak \u2013 who is also an accountant - which eventually led to controversial changes in Sydney City Council elections that gave two votes to businesses. \n\nMr Preston said he joined the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party because it was \u201ca party of policy\u201d, and despite not owning a gun. He planned to buy one, he said.\n\nHe wanted to challenge the Nationals in the seat of Upper Hunter because of evidence of obvious disadvantage in the area, despite the mining boom.\n\n\u201cWe have a view how we want to see the Upper Hunter go forward, especially for young people. For young people at the moment the best part of the Upper Hunter is the road out. We want to give young people aged 18 to 35 a reason to stay,\u201d Mr Preston said.\n\nMr Despotoski said the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party had \u201cvery active branches\u201d in Muswellbrook, Scone and Newcastle. Running a strong candidate in the Upper Hunter would benefit the area, he said.\n\n\u201cOne of the best things that can happen for this area is John running, whether he wins or not, because this is a winnable seat and the Nationals are going to have to fight. We will be looking at running candidates anywhere in regional NSW we think we can win,\u201d Mr Despotoski said.\n\nMichael Johnsen did not respond to Newcastle Herald questions.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Joanne McCarthy"},"topics":[{"name":"Tobacco industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Porn, tobacco and the Shooters\u2019 next moves|photos, video","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2300","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Newcastle","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Newcastle Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666508","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"107"},"name":"Newcastle Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theherald.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194858690","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/pBvqKxHgUnSrdaeEwDT49F/132da355-832b-4a35-a8a4-544a429ddd69.jpg/r0_394_5184_3323_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n\nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n\n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n\n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n\nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n\n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n\n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\" \n\n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty) \nSports & Recreation Tennis Serena Williams Patrick Mouratoglou Margaret Court grand slam Steffi Graf","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Yahoo!

I just tried to put everything I had into it and it seemed to work.\u201d \n \nBortovskiy and Rock netminder Jeff Veitch were both outstanding in the overtime frame, as the two teams abandoned defence in favour of fire-wagon hockey. \n \nThe line of Mathieu, Rendle and Cory Sprague accounted for four of the Rock\u2019s five goals Saturday night. \n \n\u201cWe played a good team game and we found a way to put the puck in the net tonight,\u201d Mathieu said. \n \n\u201cThe boys are really fired up and focused right now. We are playing every game like it is a playoff game right now.\u201d \n \nThe Rock jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the first period Saturday night, as Mathieu potted his 19th goal of the season at the 7:11 mark. \n \nThat\u2019s the way the opening 20 minutes ended, but the Eskis came out flying in the second period to tie things up and then take a 2-1 lead with a pair of goals seven seconds apart. \n \nRyan Forsythe\u2019s third goal of the season dead-locked the score and then Samuel Vigneux put the home side in front when he scored his fourth goal of the season. \n \nThe Rock battled back to tie things up at 2-2 six minutes later when Rendle scored his 24th goal of the season. \n \nTimmins had an excellent opportunity to retake the lead with 4:30 remaining in the middle frame, as forward Cory Sprague was hauled down on a breakaway and awarded a penalty shot. \n \nBortovskiy was up to the challenge, however, and made a right-pad save to keep the score tied. \n \nHis team rewarded him by taking the lead with just 1:01 remaining in the second period, as Alex Mitsionis scored his 13th goal of the season to send the Eskis to the dressing room for the second intermission up 3-2. \n \nThe Rock got back on even terms midway through the third period, as Dean Kiriacou scored his third goal of the season. \n \nDillan Bruce gave Eskis fans hope that they might witness their first win over the Rock this season with 4:12 remaining in the contest when he scored his 23rd goal of the season. \n \nIt would not stand up, however, as the Rock were able to get the puck past Bortovskiy with 2:28 remaining on the clock off a wild scramble in front the Eskis\u2019 net that saw Sprague credited with his 19th goal of the season. \n \nThat set the stage for Mathieu\u2019s overtime heroics. \n \nRock coach and general manager Paul Gagne acknowledged Saturday night\u2019s contest was almost as exciting as Friday night\u2019s last-second victory. \n \n\u201cIt was entertaining,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cThe fans saw a pretty good hockey game. It was another nail-biter. It was almost like pond hockey, with us playing four-on-four like that. \n \n\u201cOur strategy was that we didn\u2019t come here for one point. We were going for it and our D were jumping up into the play. We knew we had the one point, so we were going for that second point. That\u2019s why the play was so open.\u201d \n \nThat second point allowed the Rock (27-11-3-0) to pull within six points of the idle Cochrane Crunch (29-11-4-1) for second place in the NOJHL\u2019s East Division standings, and the Rock still have four games in hand on their rivals. \n \n\u201cIt was very important for us to get that second point,\u201d Gagne said. \n \n\u201cWe want to finish in second place. We want home-ice advantage in the playoffs. That\u2019s our motivation right now. If we keep playing the way we are right now, with everybody on the same page, we can do it.\u201d \n \nDespite picking up a single point, the Eskis (15-25-3-0) fell another point behind the fourth-place Kirkland Lake Gold Miners (20-20-4-2). The gap between the likely Division Qualifier opponents now stands at 13 points, although the Eskis do have three games in hand. \n \nGagne was impressed with a number of Rock players Saturday night. \n \n\u201cRendle put in a good effort, as he always does,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cHe had his mojo tonight. You could tell he was really involved. \n \n\u201cAnd Kiriacou is really coming along. We are happy with his progress. He is starting to be a little bit more comfortable in the program and he is starting to move the puck a little bit more. \n \n\u201cMathieu, obviously, is on a roll right now. He is playing really well. \n \n\u201cOn defence, we were struggling a little bit, but we started moving the puck a little bit more. When we don\u2019t move the puck well, we tend to get into trouble. Progressively, we started to move it better as the game went on. \n \n\u201cAnd our goalie (Veitch) might like to have the fourth goal back, but that was a goal scorer\u2019s shot. You have to give credit to the shooter. He made some big saves in overtime, but he did the same thing last night. \n \n\u201cWhat I like about Veitch is that he has been working really hard in practice. We got two victories this weekend and he faced a lot of shots and he made some big saves to keep us in both games.\u201d \n \nEskis coach and assistant general manager Jamy Bernier knows his team came close to finally knocking off the Rock Saturday night. \n \n\u201cWe had a lot of chances,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t find the back of the net early enough in overtime. Bortovskiy came up with some huge saves on multiple occasions, but unfortunately we ended up on the wrong side of a bounce once again. \n \n\u201cI think this is our third overtime loss since the Christmas break. We are just going to have to find a way to put ourselves ahead. Our guys are not complacent with what we picked up here tonight. They really show resilience and I believe in that group we are putting out there. \n \n\u201cThere are some small hiccups, some small misplays that are costing us goals, but we are seeing a lot of good things here. We are headed in the right direction.\u201d \n \nDespite the overtime loss, Bernier was pleased with the effort put forth by a number of Eskis Saturday night. \n \n\u201cOur fourth line, with Sam Vigneux, Ryan Forsythe and Cam Boutin, was absolutely phenomenal,\u201d he said. \n \n\u201cThey gave us two goals tonight on the same shift and every other shift they were out there, they were making something happen.

This is close to the $5.7bn figure cited by Globes a few months ago. \n \nCNA also said that a study presented in Brussels had found the pipeline to be commercially viable and technically feasible. \nSubscribers to my monthly report will have already know that I suspect the reported figure is not counting the full cost. \n \nThe entire pipeline including the land pipeline in Greece would be 1,900 km. It will also be very deep, reaching 3,000 metres in some parts. \n \nA figure of $6bn implies a pipeline cost of just $3.2 per km. To illustrate why this is too low,we can compare this with the Nord Stream pipeline. Completed in 2012, Nord Stream is 1,224 km long and only 210 deep\u2014shorter and much shallower than the proposed EastMed pipeline. \n \nNord Stream\u2019s website says that the total investment cost was $7.2bn. Of this total, $5bn was spent on pipes, pipe materials and pipe-laying. A total investment of $7.2bn implies a cost of just under $6 per km. \n \nIf we only count the $5bn investment in pipeline construction, Nord Stream comes to a cost of $4.1 per km. Either way, the NordStream cost was much higher than the amount implied in the estimate for the EastMed pipeline, which would be one of the longest, deepest pipelines in the world. \n \nI suspect that the $6bn estimate does not include the land pipeline in Greece. Remove this and the cost comes in at $4.6 per km. This is a little higher than Nord Stream, but makes sense given that it is much deeper. \n \nIt would be good if I could confirm my hunch. The studies made to date have been paid for by the EU taxpayer, because the EastMed pipeline is an EU \u2018Project of Common Interest\u2019, meaning that it can attract EU funding for studies into its viability. \n \nHowever, when I contacted the Commission to enquire whether the report would be made available, they said it was up to the companies to provide any information. \n \n  \n \nThe price must be right \n \nEven if you take the $6bn at face value and assume that new technology or weak oil prices have led to a massive reduction in costs, there is still the question of what price the sellers need in order to make a profit. \n \nAccording to my Sapienta Economics gas model, you would need a gas price of around $7 per million British thermal units (mmbtu) before you started to make a profit. \n \nEuropean gas import prices have been rising lately, reaching $5.50/mmbtu at the end of December according to World Bank data. However, with a global glut in gas, it will take a while before they stay above $7/mmbtu. \n \nWe can wait that long, or we can solve the Cyprus problem. A shorter pipeline to Turkey would be viable at a price of just above $4/mmbtu according to my model. \n \nThe writer is Director of Sapienta Economics and author of the monthly Sapienta Country Analysis Cyprus www.sapientaeconomics.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Energy industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Oil and gas news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Cyprus news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Greece news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Is the EastMed gas pipeline an option for Cyprus?","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"CY","country":"Cyprus"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Cyprus Weekly","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"245348327","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"The Cyprus Weekly","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.incyprus.com.cy"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://sapientaeconomics.com/country-analysis-cyprus/"],"sequenceId":"695194871978","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:05Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

These are priced between Rs 8.78 lakh and Rs 10.63 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). \nWhen contacted a MSI spokesperson told PTI: \u201cIn this segment (1.6 litre engine), customers go for highest trim that has all the features. Therefore, it is business prudence to keep the number of variants at an optimum level in line with customers requirements.\u201d \nThe model\u2019s performance is in line with the company\u2019s expectation, the spokesperson added. \n\u201cWe started a new segment called premium crossover with S Cross. Volume-wise, S-Cross continues to do an average of 2,000-2,100 units monthly,\u201d the spokesperson said. \nS-Cross, the first model from the stable of MSI to be sold through its premium retail chain NEXA, has had a chequered history. \nMSI had introduced the S-Cross in two options of 1.6 litre and 1.3 litre engines in 2015 coinciding with the launch of its premium retail outlet chain Nexa. However, pricing issues hindered sales of the vehicle forcing the company to go for price correction. \nLast year, the company had cut price of the vehicle by over Rs 2 lakh. The reduction in the price of 1.6 litre variant was Rs 2,05,000 for all the three trims, while that of 1.3 litre variant ranged from Rs 40,000 to Rs 66,000. \nS-Cross along with Vitara Brezza have helped the company enhance its market share in the utility vehicle (UV) segment. \nWhile Vitara Brezza has been a runaway hit, S-Cross has been a slow starter for the company. \nAcknowledging the fact, the spokesperson said: \u201cEvery brand has a specific role in the overall portfolio. While some are mass models that sell in big numbers, others may not sell as much as a mass model but contribute to the overall brand objectives of the company for the medium and long term\u201d. \nS-Cross helps Maruti Suzuki in expanding its range and presence with an eye on the future, the spokesperson added. \nGrowth in the UV segment for MSI is over 120 per cent for the April-December period this fiscal. Volume wise the company has sold 1,43,254 units during the April-December period as compared to 63,924 units in the previous fiscal. \nThe company now commands over 65 per cent market share in the total UV segment.

These are things human beings have been fighting for since we have gained consciousness, freedom and equality,\u201d Hrithik said. \n\u201cMy father is talking about the progress of the industry, producers and for people, who can\u2019t watch two films in a week on big screen with family as it costs money. So, it is better for everyone that these (big) kind of clashes don\u2019t happen.\u201d \nBoth SRK and Hrithik\u2019s films have been received well at the box office but the actor feels two big budget releases create unpredictability. \n\u201cThere was lot of uncertainty this time because of the clash. If it was a solo film, we would have been on predictable note but because of the clash there was uncertainty,\u201d he says. \n\u201cBut now the uncertainty is turning into certainty with all the feedback and love that we are getting. It comes to down to the same thing \u2013 if the film and content is good it works, you get rewards no matter what,\u201d he adds. \nThe 43-year-old actor, however, insists there is nothing much an actor can do in this as these are trade decisions. \n\u201cIt is not for me to say. I have nothing to do with it. I am an actor and my focus was to better my work. Everything else is a story. If someone tells me anything about this person or that person its a story for me. I don\u2019t get affected by it,\u201d he says when asked if the clash between \u201cKaabil\u201d and \u201cRaees\u201d should have been averted. \nDespite losing out on business, releasing two big films at the same time is not new to Bollywood, it has happened in the past and it might continue as well this year. \nLast year Hrithik\u2019s \u201cMohenjo Daro\u201d released along side Akshay Kumar starrer \u201cRustom\u201d and the latter came out as a winner of box office tussle. \nAsk Hrithik if he would now try to avoid clash of his films with others, he says, \u201cThis is not in my hands alone, it is in the hands of executives. There is a rule that if we clash then we straight away divide it 50:50 (referring to screen space).\u201d \n\u201cSo, there is no 80:20 or 60:40 and if you follow 50:50 then the clash will stop automatically. That\u2019s the best way,\u201d he says.

MSU, which has lost three straight, can\u2019t afford to drop home games to NCAA tournament bubble teams if it wants to avoid being on the bubble itself. The good news for MSU is it seems to have freshman Miles Bridges back at 100 percent and, in two of his last three games, playing as well as ever. Bridges is coming off a 33-point effort Tuesday against Purdue, which set an MSU freshman scoring mark. As MSU plays the school that produced the Fab Five, its own four-member freshman class is averaging an Izzo-era best 42.2 points and 18.7 rebounds. Spartans redshirt sophomore Kenny Goins will play with a protective mask \u2014 as he did much of last season \u2014 after breaking his nose against Purdue. \n \n\u2022 Michigan  update: The Wolverines are coming off a blistering offensive performance in a 90-60 home win over Indiana Thursday, which followed a one-sided home victory over Illinois last weekend. At 14-7 and 4-4 in the Big Ten, Michigan is creeping toward the NCAA tournament bubble. What the Wolverines lack is quality wins or road wins, though early season neutral site drubbings of Marquette and SMU are looking better by the hour. Beating MSU at Breslin would go a ways toward bringing the Wolverines into the NCAA tournament conversation seriously, if Thursday\u2019s win didn\u2019t already do that. Michigan is 0-5 this season in true road games. That\u2019ll have to change at some point if the Wolverines want to play in the Big Dance. Michigan\u2019s struggles are on defense and on the glass. The Wolverines are last in the Big Ten in field goal-percentage defense and 3-point defense and second to last in rebounding margin. \n \n\u2022 About the matchup: Michigan won\u2019t be able to punish MSU inside if the Spartans get in foul trouble. That\u2019s not what the Wolverines do, nor do they have the personnel to make MSU pay for its lack of depth of size. What Michigan can do is bury an opponent from beyond the arc. The Wolverines\u2019 9.3 3s per game are second in the Big Ten \u2014 behind Purdue and ahead of Indiana. Six different U-M players have 22 or more made 3-pointers on the season. MSU, while often statistically sound defending the perimeter, has regular lapses guarding shooters, especially off penetration. Michigan doesn\u2019t have the future NBA players in its backcourt it did when it was making deep NCAA tournament runs a few years ago. But the Wolverines have a ton of experience in this rivalry, including two senior starters (Derrick Walton and Zak Irvin) who were on the team that won at Breslin in 2014. Three of MSU\u2019s starters have never played in this matchup before today. \n \n\u2022 Prediction: There has been little carryover from game to game for most teams in the Big Ten this season, MSU and Michigan included. If the Wolverines hit 63 percent of their shots and 55 percent of their 3s and only turn the ball over six times, as they did against Indiana, then the Spartans are in trouble. Of course, Indiana\u2019s disorganized and sometimes disinterested defense contributed to those numbers. Minus the final few minutes of the first half and a few in the second Tuesday, MSU played its most complete game of the season in its loss to Purdue. That effort might get it done against Michigan. The only reliable predictive variables today are that Breslin Center will be rocking and both teams will be dialed in. Home court in this rivalry can mean a ton. \n \n» Make it: MSU 81, Michigan 77 \n \n\u2014 Graham Couch","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Tipoff: Michigan State vs. Michigan","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Isabella","zipCode":"48858","state":"Michigan","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Mount Pleasant","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Lansing State Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663314","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2303"},"name":"Lansing State Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lansingstatejournal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194879892","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A key official at the Foreign Office in Whitehall put it politely, saying, \u201cMr Modi would be welcome if he came this year, but our choice, if it comes to it, would be next year.\u201d \nSouth Block has been enquiring about options. A senior Indian diplomat ran the idea of a sojourn this summer past the British Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, during his recent visit to New Delhi. A trip this year would be scheduled immediately before or after the G20 summit in Hamburg on July 7-8. In 2018 it would be a bilateral component leading up to or in the aftermath of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in the UK. \n\n(Follow  The Tribune on Facebook ; and  Twitter @thetribunechd )   \n\nBritain\u2019s preference for next year is understandable. Prime Minister Theresa May was in Delhi less than three months ago. It would be too early to review the progress of decisions taken. If any pressing new issues arise in the interim, she and Modi can discuss these on the sidelines of the multilateral meeting in Germany. \n\nBesides, CHOGM would involve British Head of State Queen Elizabeth II, which is very important to Britain. The Commonwealth is dear to her heart. Indeed, it could well be the last time she presides over the 52-nation organisation\u2019s biennial conference. At 90, she is unlikely to travel too far for such events in future. \n\nFormer PM Manmohan Singh and Modi both have skipped recent CHOGMs. An emerging India - in the eyes of Britain \u2013 is quite central to the future of the Commonwealth. \n\nThe Commonwealth is badly in need of a shot in the arm. After Brexit, Britain is desperately seeking enhanced trade with its former colonies to compensate for a possible downturn in exports to and imports from Europe, if compelled to quit the European Common Market. \n\nBut the Commonwealth is in crisis. The British Department of International Development (DfID) has threatened to withdraw its funding unless it improved its performance.  \n\n\u201cThe Commonwealth Secretariat continues to under-perform,\" a report asserted. The secretariat claimed the review  \n\npertained to the period before Baroness Patricia Scotland became secretary-general last April. \n\nIndia is a major contributor to the Commonwealth. A senior diplomat at the Indian High Commission in London is said to have told Scotland she needs to stop bad-mouthing her Indian predecessor, Kamlesh Sharma, if she wants India\u2019s co-operation. The morale at the Commonwealth Secretariat is reportedly low. The BBC quoted senior diplomatic and political sources as alleging \u201cpoor leadership\u201d on the part of Scotland.  \n\nIt further reported: \u201cShe has been accused of financial extravagance over the refurbishment of her official residence.\" Scotland has denied the charges. However, with a meeting  \n\nof Commonwealth trade ministers on the anvil in March, the British Government is jittery. \n\nA former British Ambassador to Japan reporting directly to May has been put in charge of a team preparing for next year's CHOGM while a retired Foreign Office diplomat has been made acting chief operating officer at the secretariat. The interventions are pre-emptive moves by London to arrest the inefficiency.  \n\nMost unusual, the British Queen has expressed her inability to attend the annual Commonwealth Day reception in March. She will be represented at the reception by the Prince of Wales. \n\nThe Indian Prime Minister has been advised visits to Britain this year and next would be an overkill.  \n\nSo, does he come this summer to keep his exuberant overseas Gujarati constituency contented? Or does he visit next year to attend CHOGM? \n\nThere has over the years developed a natural closeness between the UK and India. Of course, immigration is an irritant and trade turnover could be better. Besides, the agreed partnership on counter-terrorism would be more meaningful if forces hostile to India are deterred from functioning freely in Britain. ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"UK news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Britain would prefer Modi visit next year","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Chandigarh Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169737671","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"45"},"name":"Chandigarh Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard","National","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tribuneindia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.facebook.com/The-Tribune-798949453521526/?fref=ts","https://twitter.com/thetribunechd"],"sequenceId":"695194880088","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Its full significance has now become apparent. \n \nThe find contained a mixture of extremely rare Anglo-Saxon coins and Viking silver, which provides a clearer understanding of the relationship between Alfred the Great, who ruled Wessex and his less well-known contemporary Ceolwulf II of Mercia. \n \nSome of the coins were minted with a 'Two Emperors' design, borrowed from the Romans, which shows that the currency was used in both ancient kingdoms. \n \n\"This is an extraordinary find, one which re-writes Anglo-Saxon history,\" Xa Sturgis, director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, which now houses the coins, told Sky News. \n \n\"The keeper of the coin room here came running up the stairs to tell me. The more they were excavated the more it became obvious how significant they are. These coins point to some sort of an alliance in the 870s between Alfred and Ceolwulf.\" \n \nWhile Alfred is often described as the king who founded England, uniting Mercia and Wessex, very little is known of his rival Ceolwulf. \n \n\"These coins prove that there was a very real alliance between the two men at that time,\" added Julian Baker, coin curator at the Ashmolean. \n \n\"That alliance hasn't survived in the historical record until now. Alfred manipulated history to put himself in a better light. To date, history has overemphasised Alfred's record and almost completely neglected Ceolwulf. \n \n\"We can start re-writing that decade now, courtesy of the Watlington hoard.\" \n \nThe Ashmolean has until Monday, 31 January, to raise £1.35m to keep the coins and Viking silver in Oxfordshire and they are extremely close to that figure now. \n \nMore than 500 people in the local area have donated to the fund set up to raise the cash. \n \nMr Sturgis added: \"Alfred is the only king in the history of England described as 'great'.

Captain Scott Curry restored the host's lead after the break and then the game ebbed and flowed until Bazan Velez went in again to make it 12-12. \n \nBut another New Zealand turnover settle the issue and Franco Sabato won the match for Argentina with a try in the corner. \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \nHaving won the last three editions of this event, finishing sixth wasn't particularly impressive. However there were encouraging signs in the shape of forward Iopu Iopu-Aso and playmaker Koroi. \n \nKoroi is just out of Feilding High School, but his Wellington cameos suggest the 18-year-old has talent. \n \nTalent of the sort that made Manawatu's Tomasi Cama one of the most feared ball-players on the sevens circuit. Cama is now co-coach of New Zealand and picked Koroi despite him not appearing at the recent national tournament. \n \n\"He's probably better than me,\" Cama said of Koroi. \n  \nThe teenager produced some magical touches to guide New Zealand to a 24-0 win over England in their fifth-place semifinal and looks to have a bit to offer, having played on the wing for New Zealand Secondary Schools last year. \n \n\"This is his first tournament and for a young fella he looks like he's been playing for a few years now. There's always things to work on and hopefully he's going to kick on from now,\" said Cama. \n \n\"When you look at playmakers, obviously they can pass, they can kick. But one thing they do have, they do have time when they have the ball and that's when they look forward and make decisions.\" \n \nIt's Koroi's composure that really excites Cama. \n \n\"At this stage I don't have to do a lot. He's got all the talent. If anything it's just the little things we can work on off the field to make sure that he gets out there and does what he does best.\" \n \nKoroi can't quite believe this is happening. He grew up idolising players such as Cama and team-mates DJ Forbes and Tim Mikkelson. Being picked for Wellington was one thing, but the idea he might play - and play well - was quite another. \n \n\"I've been very nervous playing out there. Very nervous,\" Koroi said. \n \nIt's just that he hasn't played like a nervous bloke. \n \n\"Just like Junior [Cama] says, when you get out on the field just play your game [and] stay calm under pressure, because you're a playmaker.\" \n      Comments","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"HAMISH BIDWELL"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"New Zealand end Wellington Sevens with defeat to Argentina","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dominion Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672420","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1076"},"name":"Dominion Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Rugby","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://stuff.co.nz"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194886356","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:58:59Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Justice Ministry owns the island and operates four prisons within its vicinity. Only prisoners, prison officers and their families live on the island. \n \nPrison authorities plan to set aside 20 hectares of land on the island for the cattle farm, Mr Dusak said. He said the project will start by raising 14,000 cattle next year. \n \nLast year, a cattle pen was built on a 2-hectare plot on Nusakambangan. It has received 30 heads of cattle for free from a corporate social responsibility programme run by state-controlled Bank Negara Indonesia this year and another 150 heads of cattle bought with money from the state budget. \n \nThis programme involves 100 prisoners as its caretakers. \n \nThe Justice Ministry said there are 150,000 hectares of prison land across the country that can be developed for various industries, including cattle farming. \n \nIndonesians have been consuming more beef as they become wealthier, but today local beef production can only supply 60 per cent of the total demand. \n \nThis year alone Indonesia will need 3.3 million cattle for slaughter, according to an estimation from the Ministry of Agriculture. \n \nThe government\u2019s ban on beef import under a self-sufficiency programme backfired a few years ago as it created a massive beef shortage in the market and forced farmers to slaughter breeding cows to meet demand. \n \nPresident Joko Widodo has set a new target of beef self-sufficiency by 2026. Meanwhile, the government plans to bring in more breeding cows from abroad to replenish the domestic population.

He would love to have a secret to keep close to the vest, or a process he could explain. \n \nBut after another third quarter explosion \u2014 25 points as the Warriors wiped the Oracle Arena hardwood with the visiting Chris Paul-less Clippers 144-98 \u2014 Curry had no enlightened answer for his third-quarter turn-ups. \n \nIt was the 17th time in his career he scored at least 20 points in a quarter. Many of those are in the third quarter. Saturday, he made 8 of 11 from the field, including five 3-pointers, to go with six rebounds and three assists. He outscored the Clippers by himself as the Warriors turned a comfortable lead into a national embarrassment for Los Angeles. \n \nThe unique part about this latest big quarter: it was planned. \n \nUsually, Curry\u2019s barrages happen organically. They are about feel and rhythm, not strategy and situation. They tend to come out of nowhere, and only those who have experience playing with Curry can sense them coming, like that neighbor who can always feel the storm coming. \n \nSaturday, the Warriors ran a play for Curry to start the third quarter. They never do that. He prefers it that way, too, as he\u2019d rather get a few trips up and down the court before shooting. \n \nBut Curry had made his last two threes. He punctuated the first half with a 51-footer straight down the middle, drilling it at the buzzer as the crowd erupted. Then after airplaning in a circle, he was drilled by Draymond Green as the two leaped into each other. Curry ended up on the hardwood. \n \nSo Kerr looked to get Curry going in the third, coax an explosion. Kevin Durant brought the ball up, and after a couple passes, got it back in the post. Curry curled off a designed double screen and stuck a free throw line jumper. \n \n\u201cIt was just amazing to watch,\u201d Draymond Green said. \u201cLike you said, I\u2019ve seen him do some pretty incredible things. You can kind of see when he\u2019s going into one of those modes. I think it started with two shots, the half-court shot and then once he came out and he hit that first pull-up in the third quarter, you could kind of see it was about to be one of those type of nights.\u201d \n \nThe nation it knew it when, on a fast break, Curry pulled it from the E on the Oracle decal, about 30 feet from the rim. The next time down, he hoisted one in a blink from 28 feet. The next time down, with Durant looking to feed Curry exclusively, a back-door cut led to a reverse layup that left Durant shaking his head in disbelief. \n \nWhat is it about Curry and third quarters? What we do know: it isn\u2019t new. The trend began under coach Mark Jackson. He remembers that vividly. \n \n\u201cThe playoffs. Game 4,\u201d Curry said. \u201cThat was wild. It was my first playoffs. And I was hurt.\u201d \n \nHe is talking about the first round series against Denver. The Warriors were up 2-1 after stealing Game 2 in Denver and hanging on for dear life in Game 3. Their 12-point lead was down to four midway through the third quarter. Control of the series was slipping away. Then Curry, playing on a sprained left ankle, went off. \n \nHe shot a 3-pointer from the left corner and turned to look at the Nuggets bench while it was still in the air. Two minutes later, another 3 followed by a layup in traffic. The next eight points came at the expense of Andre Miller. A pull-up 3-pointer during a frenetic fast break left Oracle blown away. \n \nCurry had 22 points in that third quarter. The Warriors won by 14. He did it again in the third quarter of Game 6 as the Warriors clinched the first-round upset. He had 22 in the third quarter of Game 1 against the Spurs. A trend was born. \n \nHe had 28 in the third quarter in Charlotte last season, after honoring his father at halftime of Dell Curry Night. He had 26 of his 51 points in the quarter of a win at Dallas in February 2015. He had 28 in the third quarter at New Orleans on Halloween. \n \nUnder Steve Kerr, Curry does most of his damage in the third quarter (the first is not far behind). Since the beginning of last season, Curry is averaging 9.6 points in the third quarter. James Harden is second in the NBA during that span at 8.5. \n \nHe has made 283 3-pointers in the third quarter under Kerr, nearly a third of his total. \n \n\u201cYou know it\u2019s on when he hits one from deep,\u201d Andre Iguodala said. \u201cOnce those start dropping, it\u2019s over.\u201d \n \nThere are some unofficial explanations for Curry\u2019s third quarters. He looks to be more aggressive in the third quarter after looking to get others involved the first half. He wears opponents\u2019 down in the third quarter, a nod to his stamina as he gets stronger while defenses might fall off. His teammates look for him more in the third quarters as the defenses take away other options. \n \nAnother: Curry makes mental adjustments at the half. After getting a feel for how he\u2019s being defended, the counter punches come in the second half. \n \nNone of these make Curry say \u201cthat\u2019s it.\u201d He nodded at a couple, acknowledging that could be the reason some of the time. Others, he shook his head like it\u2019s not even factor. One last explanation got his attention. \n \nIs there something about the having the opportunity to put the opponent away? \n \n\u201cThat definitely has something to do with it,\u201d said Curry, who leads the NBA at plus-276 in the third quarter so far this season. \u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s in that space where we create some separation or if we let them back in it, now it\u2019s a close game.\u201d \n \nCurry feeds off moments. And when it calls for him to carry the load \u2014 whether because the team is struggling or the opponent is on the ropes \u2014 he gets more aggressive looking for his shot. Curry in attack mode is a problem for the defense because it must be on point to stay with him. Few defenses are good enough to maintain and eventually, he gets the good looks he needs. \n \nAnd because the Warriors have been such a dominant regular season game, two or three 3-pointers from Curry is usually a knockout punch late in the third quarter. \n \nLast season, he played 60 fourth quarters in his 80 games. The Warriors have 35 games remaining this season. Saturday was already the 15th time Curry did not play the fourth quarter. After another third quarter explosion, the Warriors were up 43. \n \n ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Marcus Thompson II"},"topics":[{"name":"Stockwatch","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Warriors embarrass Clippers with Stephen Curry latest third quarter gem","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Contra Costa","zipCode":"94598","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Walnut Creek","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"East Bay Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597831994","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"East Bay Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.eastbaytimes.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194891472","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:07Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.eastbaytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sjm-warriors-0129-111.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Dodig lost his serve in the opening game of the match after a forehand unforced error. \n \nSania too lost her first service game, third of the first set, unable to return a backhand shot. \n \nThe Indo-Croatian pair took a while to get going and began to combine well in the later stages of the first set, winning their next two service games. But it wasn't enough to save the set, surrendering it 2-6. \n \nBut they stepped up their energy in the second set. Beginning to play more as a team, they attacked Spears' serve in the second game after Dodig won the first service game. \n \nThe pressure they applied paid dividends as Abigail-Cabal was hit a backhand volley wide to trail 0-2. Sania then held on to her serve to go 3-0 up. \n \nBut Sania-Dodig couldn't maintain the momentum. Sania was broken in the seventh game with a backhand volley winner. \n \nAbigail and Cabal held onto their serves to square the second set 4-4. \n \nDodig, yet to win a major title in mixed doubles, seemed nervous at the begging of the match owing to his relative inexperience in summit clashes. \n \nAnd he failed to control his nerves at crucial stages of the match, losing his serve in the ninth game with a double fault to trail 4-5. \n \nSpears served for the match in the 10th game and weren't subjected to much pressure, winning the championship with a forehand smash, which underlined their supremacy. \n \nIt was Sania's second Australian Open mixed doubles final after winning in 2009 with compatriot Mahesh Bhupathi.  \n \nPrior to Sunday's final, she won three mixed doubles titles, the last being the 2014 US Open with Brazilian Bruno Soares. \n \nThe 30-year-old Hyderabadi has six major titles in her kitty, three in mixed doubles and three in women's doubles. \n \nThe Indo-Croatian pair played their second Grand Slam final, having lost the French Open final to the experienced pair of Leander Paes and Martina Hingis last year. \n \nSania-Dodig overcame a tough one-hour-18-minute battle in the semi-final against Aussies Samantha Stosur and Sam Groth 6-4, 2-6, (10-5) on Friday. \n \nAbigail and Cabal defeated Elina Svitolina of Ukraine and Aussie Chris Guiccione 7-6 (1), 6-2 in the last four stage. \n \n© 2017 IANS India Private Limited.

It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Kogarah","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"St George & Sutherland Shire Leader","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169697910","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"St George & Sutherland Shire Leader","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.theleader.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194895081","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council.

The Rams also had a massive effort from Deontae Plouffe, who chipped in 16 points and nine rebounds. Lastly, Dyrell Rucker had 13 of his own. \n \nLynn Classical\u2019s high scoring and athletic offense kept them in front by a large margin for most of the game. \n \nBeverly, having played from behind, made things interesting late. The Panthers had a monstrous effort from senior captain Patrick Gavin who scored a game-high 30 points and five rebounds. \n \nJunior guard Luigi Derrane also had a great night, connecting on three 3-pointers and 17 points. Hugh Calice provided some muscle down low as he quietly had eight points and five rebounds. \n \nThe Panthers put up a great fight as the home crowd helped bring them back into the game, erasing a 16-point deficit in the fourth quarter. With 10 seconds left, Beverly had a shot to tie the game as Derrane\u2019s 3-point effort fell short and the Rams came out on top to remain undefeated. \n \nLynn Classical\u2019s athleticism and quick ball movement was the key to success for an undersized but versatile team that only features three seniors. With the win, Lynn Classical moved to 9-0 in the conference and Beverly fell to 7-3. \n \nThe Panthers could take away quite a few positives from this effort as Gavin had a career day and Beverly would not go down without a fight. \n \nBoth of these teams are poised for postseason runs as the offense behind the arc will keep them in any game.

But with the Spyder GT, the company has also reimagined the outer shell so that visually it's an homage to the lightweight low drag track E-Types of 1963, but with the added advantage of a soft top, for wind-in-the-hair motoring. \n \n\u201cThe Spyder GT represents the very best of what we do here at Eagle and we're thrilled to present it to the world,\u201d said Henry Pearman, Managing Director at Eagle. \n \nThe standard E-Type, though universally considered one of the most beautiful cars ever built, will never attain the levels of classic status afforded to its peers such as the Aston Martin DB5. And that's simply because there are so many of them on the roads. Jaguar built thousands upon thousands, and it built them at budget price meaning that even by 1960s standards, though they were cheap to buy they were often less than reliable. \n \nEagle started out in 1984 restoring E-Types. Then it moved to restomodding in as much as it would tune the engine, add better disc brakes and improve elements like cooling. And the company has evolved from there to the point where it can now offer keen drivers with £695,000 (about RM3.8 million) to spare an E-Type that is truly rare (the company plans to build fewer than 10), truly reliable and is truly fast, even by today's standards. \n \nThanks to that combination of lightweight aluminum and magnesium construction and a reworked Jaguar XK 4.7-litre straight six, the car can go from 0-100km/h in 5 seconds, on to a top speed in excess of 170mph and offers drivers up to 330hp and a five-speed gearbox. \n \nWhat's more, it's got modern adjustable suspension and a limited slip differential so it will handle and behave like a modern sportscar in race mode (i.e., when traction and stability control are shut off) too. \n \nBut best of all, because it started life as a standard E-Type in need of total restoration, the finished hand-built car is completely road legal and owners won't be forced to save it purely for track days. \u2015 AFP-Relaxnews","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"The Edit: The truly rare Eagle Spyder GT","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"MY","country":"Malaysia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Malay Mail","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169664182","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Malay Mail","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mmail.com.my"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194902691","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n\nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n\n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n\n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n\nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n\n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n\n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\" \n\n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Yahoo!

Its full significance has now become apparent. \n \nThe find contained a mixture of extremely rare Anglo-Saxon coins and Viking silver, which provides a clearer understanding of the relationship between Alfred the Great, who ruled Wessex and his less well-known contemporary Ceolwulf II of Mercia. \n \nSome of the coins were minted with a 'Two Emperors' design, borrowed from the Romans, which shows that the currency was used in both ancient kingdoms. \n \n\"This is an extraordinary find, one which re-writes Anglo-Saxon history,\" Xa Sturgis, director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, which now houses the coins, told Sky News. \n \n\"The keeper of the coin room here came running up the stairs to tell me. The more they were excavated the more it became obvious how significant they are. These coins point to some sort of an alliance in the 870s between Alfred and Ceolwulf.\" \n \nWhile Alfred is often described as the king who founded England, uniting Mercia and Wessex, very little is known of his rival Ceolwulf. \n \n\"These coins prove that there was a very real alliance between the two men at that time,\" added Julian Baker, coin curator at the Ashmolean. \n \n\"That alliance hasn't survived in the historical record until now. Alfred manipulated history to put himself in a better light. To date, history has overemphasised Alfred's record and almost completely neglected Ceolwulf. \n \n\"We can start re-writing that decade now, courtesy of the Watlington hoard.\" \n \nThe Ashmolean has until Monday, 31 January, to raise £1.35m to keep the coins and Viking silver in Oxfordshire and they are extremely close to that figure now. \n \nMore than 500 people in the local area have donated to the fund set up to raise the cash. \n \nMr Sturgis added: \"Alfred is the only king in the history of England described as 'great'. But these coins show that in the 870s he needed Ceolwulf. It's incredible that we know so little about him and Alfred dominates everything. It's like he obliterated Ceolwulf.\" \n \nThe Watlington Hoard, as it is now known, is on public display at the Ashmolean as historians begin the process of re-assessing that period of Anglo-Saxon history. \n  \n© 2017 Sky News, all rights reserved","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Coins discovery 'will re-write' Anglo-Saxon history","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"County Down","zipCode":"BT23","state":"Northern Ireland","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Ards","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Cool FM 97.4","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"245899094","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Cool FM 97.4","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.coolfm.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194910971","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The owners\u2019 minds would have to be changed by something dramatic, but Daly doesn\u2019t know what that new ingredient would be. \n \n\u201cIf the status quo remains, I don\u2019t expect us to be in the Olympics,\u201d Daly said. \n \n \nThe league and the International Ice Hockey Federation have no firm deadline to decide whether NHL players will participate in their sixth consecutive Olympics, but the final decision has already been left for later than in previous years. \n \nThe parties waited until June 2013 to execute their agreement for the Sochi Games, but the decision was made several months earlier. The NHL prefers to release its yearly schedule in June, which means a final decision might not be made until summer. \n \nWhile the IIHF has found the money to cover the costs of a Pyeongchang trip after some initial reluctance, the NHL has numerous concerns that aren\u2019t overwhelmed by the excitement of nurturing the game overseas and exposing its biggest investments to injury. \n \nCommissioner Gary Bettman drove the NHL\u2019s decision to participate in its first Olympics in 1998, but the league sees fewer reasons to shut down for three weeks while playing a compressed schedule. Bettman said the issue \u201cgot about 10 seconds of discussion\u201d at the board meeting Saturday because nothing has changed. \n \n\u201cI think the realities of Olympic participation are more apparent to our board now, and I think it just leads to less enthusiasm about the disruption,\u201d Daly said. \u201cQuite frankly, we don\u2019t see what the benefit is from ... the league standpoint anyway with respect to league participation, so that\u2019s the challenge. As Gary said numerous times, if there was a compelling reason that we could bring to the board that this is something we should do again in Korea, then we present it to the board and see what they would have to say.\u201d \n \nDaly acknowledged that geography plays a role in the board\u2019s position: Pyeongchang is 14 hours ahead of New York, which will mean difficult game times for viewers in North America. The league also doesn\u2019t anticipate major growth in its game from playing in South Korea. \n \n\u201cI think on occasion in the past, it has\u201d produced growth in the game to play in the Olympics, Daly said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it necessarily would in South Korea. Time and exposure, all those issues related to (being) a long way away.\u201d \n \nThe IOC and the IIHF benefit enormously in exposure with the NHL\u2019s participation. Bettman and IIHF President Rene Fasel are expected to meet up this weekend \n \nThe players gathered in Los Angeles for All-Star weekend are unanimously hopeful they\u2019ll be allowed to play, but they\u2019re aware of the increasingly strident tone against the games being taken by their owners. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t think you should be able to pick and choose what Olympics you go to,\u201d said New Jersey forward Taylor Hall, who has been to world championships for Canada, but not the Olympics. \u201cThat\u2019s not what the Olympics stand for. If you ever talk to anyone that has participated in the Olympics, whether it is a hockey player or a javelin thrower, it\u2019s a special place. It\u2019s something that I would love to be a part of, and I wouldn\u2019t want to see it taken away because the NHL didn\u2019t want to go to South Korea. It\u2019s special no matter what.\u201d \n \nWashington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin has previously said that he would play for Russia in Pyeongchang even if the league didn\u2019t shut down. He didn\u2019t repeat that declaration Saturday, one day after being recognized as one of the 100 greatest players in NHL history, but he left no doubt he wants to be there. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure everybody wants to go,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cWhen I talk to the guys from my team in Washington, everybody wants to go. I think it\u2019s great for hockey, great for us and great for our countries.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Greg Beacham The"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: ice hockey news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: Olympic Games news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NHL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"NHL brass still leaning against Olympic shutdown in 2018","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Middlesex","zipCode":"06457","state":"Connecticut","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Middletown","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Middletown Press","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169710363","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"112"},"name":"Middletown Press","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.middletownpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194917933","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:35:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.middletownpress.com/storyimage/MI/20170128/SPORTS/170129606/AR/0/AR-170129606.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

If this cycle continues, then we are no different from an addict satisfying his or her craving for a high fix rather than admitting that he or she has a problem and requires rehabilitation. \n\nThe short term solution is always easier, but it never truly alleviates the underlying problem that exists. \n\nIt is time for us to admit that Trinidad and Tobago has evolved into a lawless society and we are all somewhat responsible for this occurrence. However, there is still hope. The rehabilitation process must start. An excellent place to start is with the effective socialization of our children. This is the responsibility of not only parents but all agents involved in the development of our nation\u2019s children. \n\nAs an educator, it alarms me to see the monsters we have and are continuing to create as a result of poor policy formation and rules created by individuals who have never taught in a classroom environment. \n\nThe school is an environment where a child learns not only academic information, but is taught to obey rules and regulations that governs that institution. \n\nThe skills acquired from school lays the foundation for good citizenship beyond the parameters of the classroom. However, in recent times this is not the case. Slowly the school is unconsciously evolving into a place that encourages lawlessness among students. \n\nIncidents of male students sexually assaulting female teachers is an example of this, with no retribution for the teacher. In addition to this, the teacher will be blamed for her attire and should not make any attempt to defend herself. If she does, this would be seen as inflicting violence towards a child and would be disciplined according to the law. Thus an environment that encourages disrespect for women is created. \n\nThe irony is that we are surprised when we hear of heinous crimes committed against women ignorant to the fact that we have been supporting this behaviour from the get go. \n\nWe live in a contemporary society, where children are exposed to a variety of uncensored data via social media. This, merged with a host of social and economic issues, makes the task of socialization quite problematic. \n\nConsequently, the school must be seen as a back-bone for instilling values that are synonymous with integrity and diligence, and must therefore act as a catalyst for invoking positive change. At no time must a laissez-faire attitude towards wrongdoing be perceived or entertained. \n\nThis technique would not only zoom in on the irate children but would provide an avenue for effective rehabilitation and restoration. \n\nThe benefits of this approach can be far-reaching however it requires all stakeholders to be united, from the policy-makers to the man on the streets, each one of us must do our part in saving our country. \n\n(Editor\u2019s Note: Prof Ramesh Deosaran is off this week.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andy Noel"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"TT needs rehab","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"TT","country":"Trinidad and Tobago"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Trinidad and Tobago's Newsday","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169680334","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Trinidad and Tobago's Newsday","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsday.co.tt"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194924155","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

City officials have their own plans for improving the downtrodden area. \n \nOnce a bright spot for tourism, Gold Rock has slipped further and further from the sun in the last few decades. The Nash County Travel and Tourism Development Authority collects 5 percent of every hotel room sale in the county, including the nine motels at Gold Rock, the eight hotels around Winstead Avenue, the 10 hotels along U.S. 301 and 10 other inns scattered around the county. \n \nRecords obtained by the Telegram show overall Rocky Mount hotel room sales have increased in recent years while sales at Gold Rock have declined. \n \nIn 2002-03, total sales was at $21.8 million, climbing to $28 million in 2015-16. At Gold Rock, motel room sales dropped from $5.5 million in 2002-03 to $3.4 million in 2015-16, dipping below $3 million for five of those years. \n \nThe numbers show expanding sales for hotels along Winstead Avenue and U.S. 301, but a steady decline for the motels at Gold Rock. In fiscal year 2015-16, the Winstead Avenue hotels collected $947,520.93. That same year, the motels at Gold Rock collected $176,772.89. Or to put it another way, Winstead Avenue hotels took in 69.51 percent of the occupancy tax collected while Gold Rock motels collected 12.97 percent. \n \nOf course, rooms at Gold Rock are cheaper with some of the motels advertising $25 a night, but the real reason the motels aren't filling up is folks are uncomfortable staying there, according to county officials. \n \nIn 2016, there were nearly 100 arrests made or incident reports filed related to the Gold Rock area by the Rocky Mount Police Department.

The only thing that this state of affairs has \u2018developed\u2019 is disdain towards users of public transportation, because apparently, taking a bus or riding the ferry to Tobago is reserved for our society\u2019s poor. \n\nDespite the Trinbagonian opinion on the situation, ironically, many are all too happy to chase after buses or squeeze through closing train doors when visiting foreign countries. The time has come for a change in mind-set to the way we approach policies on public transportation and alleviating traffic. \n\nIn cities like London, New York and Paris, the vast majority of residents use public transportation, and it is not because they are poor. In fact, in these three cities that have consistently ranked in the top 10 wealthiest cities for years, commuters park their Range Rovers, Jaguars and Porsches at home or at a parkand- ride and hop on a train or bus instead. Others even opt to don a helmet to accessorise their expensive suits and ride bicycles to their business empires, their fancy offices and firms, or to the financial districts of Canary Wharf, Wall Street, or La Défense. \n\nIn contrast, poverty is glaring throughout Trinidad and Tobago, yet many people, despite working monotonous poorly paid jobs in \u201cthe city,\u201d are forced to purchase vehicles where it now seems that cars outnumber pedestrians at peak hours. \n\nThankfully, I don\u2019t have to endure the sickening commute to and from Port-of-Spain every day, unlike so many children and the core group of workers in our government ministries. I am not in possession of a bus route pass, nor do I have the option of a police convoy at my disposal like our politicians who are clearly disconnected from the commuting public; I merely have a job that offers flexibility. \n\nHowever, on the very rare occasion when I have to make the morning commute into Port-of- Spain, I can never understand how every day these children and civil servants are forced to waste several unproductive hours in traffic, crawling along our overcrowded roads. \n\nAnd not just that, I notice that many vehicles have only one occupant. \n\nPoliticians do not care about the extent of the traffic woes facing the general public; and that is exactly why no one shows any concern with progressing public transportation policies or on improving the infrastructure and systems in place for public travel. \n\nSocially, family time is reduced while fatigue increases. We talk of family structures being in turmoil and blame crime on parents who are unable to \u201craise their offspring properly,\u201d but that is almost impossible for a single mother working an 8-4 government job, who has to leave home at 0500 (even earlier for the folks from deep south and far east) to reach to work in Port-of-Spain on time, and then reach home at 6 pm (or later) just in time to prepare for the next day and get some rest. \n\nA properly functioning public transportation system has great social benefits as it (1) helps foster a sense of community as people travelling together are more likely to feel a connection than those travelling in cars in isolation; (2) encourages our society to have a more active healthy lifestyle; (3) reduces car accidents; and most importantly, (4) rather than driving in traffic or wasting time looking for a parking spot in a place where the unconstitutional wrecking cartel continues to operate with impunity, public transport passengers can relax and listen to music or read a book. \n\nAn efficient public transportation system has to be a priority going forward, not just a 2020 vision or dream, and the development of rural transportation systems must be as important as it should be in urban areas. \n\nJust like I did in England, I would love to leave my vehicle parked at home during the week and catch a bus or a train to my destination; vehicle ownership should only be necessary for commute after hours and weekends when the frequency of service is reduced. \n\nSimilar to our options for dealing with crime, making this type of progress is not because the research must now begin, it is because the people with the ideas and draft polices are being ignored. Dr Rae Furlonge and former Public Transport Service Corporation (PTSC) general manager, Dr Trevor Townsend, are transportation engineers and experts who have drafted policy after policy after policy and nothing is impl e - mented. \n\nBut it doesn\u2019t b o t h e r our politicians, so why w o u l d t h e y care?","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JAMILLE BROOME Sunday"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Trinidad and Tobago news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Traffic policy in reverse","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"TT","country":"Trinidad and Tobago"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Trinidad and Tobago's Newsday","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169680334","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Trinidad and Tobago's Newsday","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsday.co.tt"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194924737","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Why?\u201d asks the taxi driver.\n\n\u201cWe went past it twice,\u201d says Coogan. \n\nOn a similar note, I would like to thank the taxi drivers of Trinidad and Tobago for facilitating my knowledge of the country, and particularly the back streets, down which they nip on their lifelong mission to avoid junctions and congestion. \n\nWhen I first lived in Tobago and had to have an overnight stay in Port-of-Spain, the owner of the little hotel I phoned gave me a tip: don\u2019t use the regular taxis, because they\u2019re expensive. She described how to get from the boat to Woodford Square, where I would find the kind of taxis that you share with three or four other people and which ply a set route, which makes them more like very small buses. \n\nYou have to be careful, though, because although most of the drivers are honest, some are not. There is one, for instance, who cruises around slowly, very gently pipping his horn to attract attention, so desperate is he to fill the space in his tired family-size Nissan. And woe betide you if you don\u2019t have the correct money, because this man doesn\u2019t give change. Hand him a larger note and it disappears into his pocket with nothing coming in the other direction. \n\nHaving acquired a car in which to criss-cross Tobago, it became my own mission to learn how to get around, while avoiding crashing into the back of the selfsame cabs, whose habit it is to pull up immediately, without warning and without pulling into the side of the road. If somebody wants them to stop, they stop, right there, right then. \n\nIt must be a boring way to earn a living, going up and down the same roads all the time, so maybe slamming on the anchors and challenging the rest of us to avoid them adds spice to their existence. \n\nThe traditional taxi driver, though, faces no such boredom, because he is constantly trying to outwit everyone else. Although at first it seems as if they are pulling the wool over your gullible, recently- arrived eyes, the fact that they never seem to be going the right way may in fact be proof of their innate cunning. There is always traffic at junctions, so they will turn left just before one and then take the first right, or vice versa. On a chess board, if articulated lorries are the queens and motorbikes the bishops, taxis are knights, taking small detours, achieving results by doing unexpected things. \n\nIn this respect they are the antithesis of satnav, that tediously literal, uninventive dictator who knows the route because it\u2019s obvious. Follow the satnav\u2019s instructions and you\u2019re going the same way as everyone else. What the expert local driver knows is not just that certain roads are congested at times, but at what times. He may even have inside knowledge of parties, weddings, funerals and other special events that are going to make a particular area a nightmare on one particular occasion. \n\nIf such a driver were to develop his or her own satnav, the vocal instructions would have to be laced with clarifications such as \u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe this\u2026\u201d or \u201cI know this sounds crazy, but\u2026\u201d. \n\nOn one such trip recently, with the destination being a building just outside the really busy part of town, the driver actually went into the growling, exhaust-filled maelstrom just long enough to get going the right way up a one-way street that had seemed destined to spoil everyone\u2019s fun \u2013 or in my case make me late, and if there is one thing I hate it\u2019s that. \u201cNauseatingly punctual\u201d is an expression that covers it, and those of us who suffer from it are, of course, living in the wrong place, in a geographical area which laughs off its lack of respect for schedules with the concept of \u201cisland time\u201d. \n\nEven I, though, had to tip my hat to a woman I knew briefly in the UK. When I warned her that I would be picking her up at exactly eight o\u2019clock because that\u2019s just how I am, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s okay, I\u2019m the same. I think ten minutes early is late.\u201d But I digress, which is perhaps a strange thing for a punctualist to do. While taking taxis obviously costs money, at least it saves the cost of buying local newspapers, because the drivers know what\u2019s going on, even if it is often delivered from a rather jaundiced viewpoint. \n\nElection time? This guy has his finger on the pulse \u2013 and that pulse is pretty weak, he will tell you. \n\nHa n g on a minute: didn\u2019t we just pass the Eiffel Towe r ?

But there were hopeful signs in housing and business investment that the economy will rebound in the coming months. \n \nThe gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of just 1.9 percent in the October-December period, a slowdown from 3.5 percent growth in the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported Friday. GDP, the broadest measure of economic health, was held back by a swing in trade with exports of soybeans plunging in the fourth quarter after having surged in the third quarter. \n \n\u201cIf you smooth out the volatility in soybeans, you get growth of around 2.5 percent in the two quarters,\u201d said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t have a slowdown at the end of the year.\u201d \n \nFor all of 2016, the economy grew 1.6 percent. It was the worst showing in five years since a similar 1.6 percent gain in 2011. GDP grew 2.6 percent in 2015, and since the recession ended in mid-2009, growth has averaged a weak 2.1 percent. \n \nBut analysts believe there were signs in Friday\u2019s report of a rebound in business spending and housing activity, which could lead to stronger growth in 2017 of around 2.5 percent. \n \nPresident Donald Trump has set a goal of doubling growth to 4 percent in coming years through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts, deregulation and higher infrastructure spending. \n \nPrivate economists believe sustained annual growth rates of 4 percent will be a high hurdle, given underlying trends such as slow growth in the labor market and weak productivity. However, many analysts have been boosting their forecasts believing that Trump will succeed in getting at least a portion of his program approved by a Republican-led Congress. \n \nFor the fourth quarter, the biggest factor contributing to the slowdown was a widening in the trade deficit. Exports, which had been temporarily bolstered by a surge in sales of soybeans to Latin America, retreated in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, imports surged. \n \nTrade cut 1.7 percentage points from growth in the fourth quarter after adding 0.9 percentage point to growth in the third quarter. A higher trade deficit subtracts from economic growth because it means more production is being supplied from abroad. \n \nConsumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic growth, slowed to still-solid growth of 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter from a 3 percent gain in the third quarter. But business investment spending accelerated in the fourth quarter, rising at a 2.4 percent rate, the best showing in more than a year. That\u2019s a hopeful sign that a prolonged slowdown in investment spending, reflecting in part big cuts by energy companies, is coming to an end. \n \nResidential construction, which had been falling for two quarters, rebounded in the fourth quarter, rising at an annual rate of 10.2 percent while government spending grew at a 1.2 percent rate as strength in state and local activity offset a drop in activity at the federal level. \n \nRebuilding of business stockpiles added 1 percentage point to growth in the fourth quarter. The cutbacks in business investment along with efforts by companies to reduce an overhang of unwanted inventories were major reasons growth slowed in 2016. \n \nEconomists are forecasting a better performance in 2017, with many raising their forecasts to incorporate the potential impact of Trump\u2019s stimulus program. They believe that the prolonged reduction in stockpiles has run its course and business spending on new plants and equipment will begin to rebound. \n \nEconomists at the International Monetary Fund last week boosted their outlook for U.S. GDP to 2.3 percent this year and 2.5 percent in 2018, saying the increase reflected expectations that Trump\u2019s economic program of tax cuts, regulatory relief and higher infrastructure had boosted growth prospects. \n \nSome private economists are even more optimistic. Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC, said he had pushed his outlook up to growth of 2.4 percent in 2017 and 2.7 percent in 2018. \n \nSung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State\u2019s Martin Smith School of Business, said there is a lot of uncertainty at the moment about Trump\u2019s program since the new administration has yet to put forward its plan for Congress to consider. \n \n\u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know the size, the scale and the timing of the Trump program,\u201d Sohn said. \u201cBut it is very possible that we will get a significant boost to economic growth in the second half of next year if Trump is successful getting his program through Congress.\u201d \n \nSohn predicted growth rates could jump to 3.5 to 4 percent. GDP growth has averaged a lackluster 2.1 percent in the 7½ years since the recession ended, a point that Trump repeatedly brought up during the campaign.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Economics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Economic growth slows in fourth quarter, but there's hope ahead","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Edgecombe","zipCode":"27802","state":"North Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Rocky Mount","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Rocky Mount Telegram","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169756322","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"34"},"name":"Rocky Mount Telegram","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.rockymounttelegram.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194927024","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And (expletive) you too pay me.\u201d \n   \nAlthough he admitted he hadn\u2019t heard all of McGregor\u2019s words, White\u2019s pointed response was the most serious counter to the lightweight champ\u2019s brash form of self-promotion, which has frequently targeted the UFC as he\u2019s grown into one of its biggest stars. The executive didn\u2019t entirely take the bait, however, linking McGregor\u2019s statement to efforts to push an online product. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear all that,\u201d White said. \u201cHey, listen, when you\u2019re about to do a pay-per-view that you\u2019re charging people five bucks to listen to you talk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got to say some pretty crazy (expletive).\u201d \n \nAs the crazy idea of ever seeing Mayweather and McGregor in a ring, White shot that down, too. \n \n\u201cHere\u2019s what I think the chances are: About the same as me being the backup quarterback for (Tom) Brady on (Super Bowl) Sunday,\u201d he said. \n \nWhite previously made headlines when he offered Mayweather and McGregor $25 million each and a cut of pay-per-view profits to step into the squared circle. Mayweather dismissed the offer outright. \n \nSince that exchange, White said there\u2019d been no talks with the Mayweather camp and added his offer didn\u2019t signal a renewed interest in the bout. \n \n\u201c(I made an offer) because (Mayweather) was full of (expletive),\u201d White said. \u201cHe said he had made an offer, which wasn\u2019t true. So I made a real offer.\u201d \n \nIs there a chance, though, all the talk is just a prelude to a blockbuster? \n \n\u201cI\u2019ll be suiting up Sunday,\u201d White deadpanned. \n \nFor more on UFC on FOX 23 , check out the UFC Events section of MMAjunkie. \n  \nUFC on FOX 23 , Featured , Featured Videos , News , UFC , Videos \n  1.7k  shares","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Steven Marrocco"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dana White issues warning to Conor McGregor after Instagram outburst","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dutchess","zipCode":"12601","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Poughkeepsie","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Poughkeepsie Journal","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666792","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"583"},"name":"Poughkeepsie Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com","publisher":"Gannett"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mmajunkie.com/author/mmajunkiesteven","http://mmajunkie.com/author/justin-park","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/conor-mcgregor-boasts-5000-attendance-for-live-ppv-interview-and-declares-expletive-the-ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/dana-white-offers-conor-mcgregor-and-floyd-mayweather-25-million-each-and-ppv-cut","http://mmajunkie.com/events/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/events","http://mmajunkie.com/tag/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured-videos","http://mmajunkie.com/category/news","http://mmajunkie.com/category/ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/category/videos","http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"],"sequenceId":"695194930722","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:08:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2590","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Cootamundra","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Cootamundra Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"200428048","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Cootamundra Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.cootamundraherald.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194933711","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:26Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

The other a single win in three seasons. \n \nFrom a numbers perspective, Brentwood Academy and Austin Peay  couldn\u2019t be more different. Success versus a program with the worst active losing streak in Division I football. \n \nAnd yet, Austin Peay is on its way to having at least five former Brentwood Academy players on its roster this fall in just two recruiting classes. Signing day is Wednesday. \n \nDefensive back Trent Taylor, defensive back/linebacker Chris Hopkins and running back Prince Momodu were part of Austin Peay coach Will Healy\u2019s first signing class. This year, two of the early commitments to Austin Peay were Brentwood Academy\u2019s Jack McDonald and three-star quarterback Jeremiah Oatsvall . \n \nSo why would a player from a successful high school program such as Brentwood Academy \u2013 which beat Montgomery Bell Academy in 2015 and 2016 to claim the Division II-AA title \u2013 even consider Austin Peay? \n \nOatsvall said it\u2019s because \u201cthere\u2019s a coaching staff that understands that they need kids from winning programs to help turn the program around.\u201d \n  \nMBA defensive back Cameron Wade (8) stops Brentwood Academy's Jack McDonald (18) near the goal line in the second half of the Division II-AA championship game Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016.  (Photo: George Walker IV / File / The Tennessean) \n  \nSelling an 0-11 team isn\u2019t easy. Healy and his staff have to focus on the future, the potential, the plan to turn it around and how the recruit fits into this vision. \n \nIt worked with Oatsvall, who said being a priority was an appealing part of the pitch. \n \nThe coaches aren't bad recruiters, either. \n \n\u201cThose (Healy and his staff) are probably the most impressive recruiters I\u2019ve ever been around,\" Brentwood Academy coach coach Cody White said. \"They are just really good with the kids. I think they lay out a vision, and they do a good job explaining that to our players.\u201d \n \nHealy and his staff\u2019s openness about the rough first year, vision for the future and overall approach has left White with no qualms if any of his players mention interest in Austin Peay. \n \nBoth McDonald and Oatsvall, who took an official visit to the university recently, mentioned an immediate sense of belonging and care for them as a person from the coaches. However, having guys they know and trust on the roster did help both truly vet the program and are a reason why they are optimistic for the future. \n \n\u201cOnce you play with people that you know and grow that brotherhood, that friendship, that automatically makes your play on the field that much more better,\u201d McDonald said. \n \nAnd getting better is something that both believe will happen; otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t be going there. \n \n\u201cThere is no doubt that we are going to win games,\" McDonald said. \"Starting next year.

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n \n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n \n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n \nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n \n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n \n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\" \n \n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Metro.us","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169666282","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"36"},"name":"Metro.us","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.metro.us"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194941607","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.metro.us/x/rss-i/us-online-report-sports-news/2017/01/29/KThhN_0LRe4OkYpIWySAuA/LYNXMPED0S06H.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

First St., the company will be operating a temporary store in Weiser that is also centrally located. And it could be open as early as next week. \n   \nBarely half a small city block from the established Ridley\u2019s lot, the former King\u2019s Department Store building at 650 State Street was due to be occupied soon by administrative staff from Weiser Memorial Hospital. However, on Jan. 20, the day after the roof collapse at Ridley\u2019s, Weiser Memorial Hospital Chief Executive Officer Steve Hale called a special meeting of the hospital district\u2019s trustees, who decided to delay the hospital\u2019s use of the State Street building so that Ridley\u2019s could temporarily use that space instead. \n   \n\u201cIt was decided that due to the greater need of the community, the hospital would allow Ridley\u2019s to lease the entire space for an interim grocery store while their damaged grocery store is being rebuilt,\u201d the hospital stated in a post on its Facebook page. \n   \nLayna Hafer, the hospital\u2019s community relations manager, said the hospital had leased half of the former King\u2019s building to serve as new offices for billing and several other administrative departments, most of which are not currently housed at Weiser Memorial\u2019s main complex on East Fifth Street. Plans call for offices, located in two different buildings the hospital currently leases, to all move into the State Street building. \n   \nHafer said remodeling of the interior space in the State Street building was nearly complete at the time of the Ridley\u2019s roof collapse, and Ridley\u2019s has agreed to restore that remodeling after the grocery store is through using the building. She said there\u2019s \u201cnot a hard and fast time-line\u201d for Ridley\u2019s to move out and for the hospital offices to move in. \n   \nMark Ridley, director of operations for Ridley\u2019s Family Market, expressed his appreciation for the Weiser Memorial Hospital. He said if it wasn\u2019t for the hospital\u2019s voluntary gesture, it would not be possible to provide the community with a local grocery store. \n   \nRidley adds that the temporary store could be open as early as next week. In the meantime, residents with a Weiser zip code can have their groceries delivered for free from the Ridley\u2019s store in Middleton. \n   \nPeople can do that through an online shopping service that comes with a minimum purchase. But this is only temporary. \n   \n\u201cOnce our temporary location opens at the former King\u2019s store, that service will stop,\u201d Ridley said. \n   \nAs for products that were left in the store at the time of the collapse, none of it has been retrieved given that the building has not been deemed safe, according to Ridley. \n   \n\u201cThe new store will be completely stocked with new product,\u201d he said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Ridley\u2019s could open as early as next week in its temporary spot","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Malheur","zipCode":"97914","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Ontario","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Argus Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169733697","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"52"},"name":"Argus Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.argusobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194950107","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And Small Business Saturday was a busy day, said David Borlaug, president of the Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation, which runs the gallery. \n\n\"In spite of the bad weather, in terms of original art, sales have been great,\" he said. \"It validates Bismarck was ready for this kind of gallery.\" \n\nBorlaug said Bismarck has been \"blessed\" with a multitude of galleries, each with a different niche. Bismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative, Bismarck Art & Galleries Association and Gallery 522 all feature member artists' works. There's also Art Gallerie on Main, where Lydia Richez-Bowman features her own work and that of several other local artists, as well as teaching classes. \n\nBorlaug said Capital Gallery is focused on featuring two artists on its walls \u2014 one expressive and one traditional \u2014 along with several others who work in various other media, such as glass or bronze. The gallery sets itself apart by limiting the number of artists and featuring them for longer periods. And because it does not cater to member artists, \"the world's our oyster,\" he said. \n\nBorlaug has artists lined up for the foreseeable future, with Deane Collin Fay of Gackle alongside Bismarck native Vern Erickson's western Americana pieces coming up in Februarym The Bismarck Tribune (http://bit.ly/2joTPY3 ) reports. \n\n\"There is a thriving art culture in Bismarck,\" Borlaug said. \"We're just glad to be part of it.\" \n\nHe points to Jessica Wachter as an up-and-coming Bismarck artist who has a \"real following across the country,\" with works featured in galleries in Los Angeles and Scottsdale, Ariz. \n\nStephanie Delmore of Gallery 522 agrees. \n\n\"I think we're just getting to that point of there being enough galleries\" that they could partner on events, like gallery hops, she said. \"We can start to thread ourselves together.\" \n\nAs Bismarck's population has become more diverse, Delmore said there are more people who are used to going to galleries on a regular basis. \n\n\"I think the traffic is picking up,\" she said, with the public understanding what art adds to a community. \n\nSince starting 32 years ago, Gallery 522 has wanted all local artists to be able to show their work daily rather than wait five years for their turn at a larger show. \n\n\"We've always meant to be of service to artists,\" Delmore said, and on a day-to-day basis, the gallery has a multitude of artists covering its walls. \n\nBismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative works much the same way, though with slightly different rules and organization, while BAGA has become more well-known for hosting larger shows for its member artists, Delmore said. \n\n\"I think we've got a lovely base of artists in the area,\" she said, and having more galleries showcasing those artists could result in more art-focused events come spring. \n\nBorlaug said he thinks Bismarck is where Fargo was a couple decades ago in terms of growing from a big town to a small city \u2014 and art \"makes cities.\" \n\n\"I feel Bismarck is more than ready to grow its arts community,\" he said. \n\nIn turn, that community could help grow the city, attracting more residents. Borlaug said one of the first things people want to know about before moving somewhere is the arts scene: Is there a symphony? An orchestra? Visual arts? \n\n\"It could help get people to move here,\" he said, and the art produced here is helping tell this area's story. \n\n--- \n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com \n\nAP Member Exchange shared by The Bismarck Tribune.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JESSICA HOLDMANThe Bismarck Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Number of art galleries increases for Bismarck","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fresno","zipCode":"93786","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fresno","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Fresno Bee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169688462","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3053"},"name":"Fresno Bee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fresnobee.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2joTPY3","http://www.bismarcktribune.com/"],"sequenceId":"695194950277","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Still, others have been seen ditching the effort, altogether. The berms were made taller this week in some areas around Ontario such as this intersection on the corner of Southwest Fourth Avenue and Southwest Fouth Street. \n   \nWhen Oregon Department of Transportation maintenance crews cleared the right-hand lanes of several feet of packed snow and ice along Fourth and Idaho avenues this week, the city had to make the decision between road and sidewalk, said City Manager Adam Brown in an email to the Argus. \n   \n\u201cWe made a decision that the roadway and bike lane were more valuable. Pedestrians were already having trouble on the sidewalk, he said. \u201cBusinesses were having trouble keeping up with it, and the longer they waited, the harder it got.\u201d \n   \nPointing out that people had been walking in the middle of the road prior to ODOT crews coming to town, officials \u201cmade a choice to open up the traffic lanes,\u201d Brown said. \n   \nAs for those sidewalks that are now buried in feet of snow and ice from passing ODOT crews clearing away the right-hand lanes with tractors, plows and gigantic snowblowers, the city is going to be lenient. \n   \n\u201cWe will not be enforcing the sidewalk ordinance along Fourth Avenue,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe will not be attempting to clean them ourselves either.\u201d \n   \nHe recommends pedestrians use alternative routes, such as those roads a block to the north or south of Fourth Avenue. \n   \nBrown did not say wether the city intends to haul off any snow, but now that storm drains are clear it may not be necessary. \n   \n\u201cWe are going to have to wait for the snow to melt,\u201d he said. \n   \nAnd cold temperatures have prevented much of that so far, but nearly 40 to 50 percent of the city\u2019s storm drains have now been cleared, according to Brown. \n   \nAll the plowing and snowfall, however, have created some hazards, including ruptures of natural gas meters and lines. The amount of snow has also made them difficult to locate in the case of emergencies, a news release from the City of Ontario states. \n   \n\u201cPlease take extra care while removing the snow and in the event a meter is hit, call\u201d according to the release.

These masses of people around the world are saddened that the Obamas' two terms have ended but they can all rejoice that not even smidgen of corruption has tainted a White House during their time in office. \n \nObama is regarded around the world as an erudite orator. His wife, when she chose to back Hillary Clinton, went on the campaign trail and gave some memorable speeches. They are seen as two of the country's foremost intellectuals. Sure, they have had their detractors, but no one doubts the level of thought and discourse they brought to the table. \n \nThey brought to that office something each individual can take - not just American people - the 'audacity of hope'. It is this presidency that succeeded the 2008 global recession and led the world out of it. There was a lot of uncertainty at the time President Obama took office, but he entered with self-belief and confidence, and the world followed suit. \n believe in yourself  \nHe knew that if we are confident that we can transform the hard times, we must come to believe in ourselves. It's the ultimate lesson to our corporate leaders about transformation. if it is to happen, each person must believe in himself or herself. Each person has to believe in his capacity to push through obstacles until the goal is reached. If the goal is non-negotiable, we have to tell our young people that study is not optional. We must commit to work. \n \nBarack and Michelle were resilient in the face of resistance to their studies, but they believed in themselves. They were committed. To them, excuses counted for nought; they believed they would find a way or make one. They were finally Harvard lawyers, and it's a training that proves that education can take you anywhere. \n \nDespite the workload of the presidency, Barack and Michelle found time to invest in their health. He is known for playing golf with players such as NBA superstar Stephen Curry and does a regular workout. Michelle has invested, not just in her daughters, Malia and Sasha, but is the key spokesperson for the Let's Move! campaign. It encourages kids to be physically active. \n \nObama has left a left a legacy of restoring relations with Cuba after 56 years of bad blood and disputes. His injunction lifts the embargo on Cuba and calls for positive engagement with the Cuban people and government.

Investigators say more than US$2 billion in bribes were paid out in a kickback scheme that was centred at state oil company Petrobras and included major construction companies like Odebrecht. In the last few years, dozens of politicians and top businessmen have been convicted and jailed, and many more are facing charges. \n \nIn a wide-ranging interview, Dallagnol said the investigation \"lives at risk\" because of forces trying to snuff it out. He said the pressures were increasing as the number \"of powerful people caught up in it grows by the day.\" \n \nDallagnol said the loss of Supreme Court Justice Teori Zavascki, who was overseeing a large part of the investigation and died in a plane crash last week, was a huge blow but ultimately would not derail the many cases in progress. \n \nHe said that while many believed the investigation was creating a \"new Brazil,\" its long-term impact depended on whether Latin America's largest nation took measures to reform its political and judicial systems. He likened it to an ill patient who goes to the doctor and gets a diagnosis but doesn't act on the medical advice. \n \n\"Unfortunately, we are still at the diagnostic stage,\" said Dallagnol, who studied law in Brazil and then did a master's degree at Harvard University. \n \nDallagnol said the Car Wash investigation was succeeding thanks to a four-pronged strategy: plea bargains that lead to new revelations, operational \"phases\" that build on each other, close co-operation between justice and legal officials, and a transparent communication strategy that includes divulging details of cases once arrests are made. \n \nDallagnol also praised Moro, the judge, saying his vast knowledge of laws related to corruption and ability to succinctly apply the law were key factors. \n HEROES  \nTo many Brazilians, fed up with corruption and their political leaders, Moro and Dallagnol are heroes, a designation that Dallagnol flatly rejects. \n \n\"We are just doing our jobs,\" he said. \n \nThe investigation has become so large that it is expanding to other states and judges. The arrest warrant issued Thursday in Rio for Eike Batista, previously one of the world's richest men now wanted for allegedly making bribes, is a testament to how far the Car Wash investigation and its offshoots have gone. \n \nLast year, prosecutors reached a plea agreement with dozens of executives of constructor Odebrecht. The agreements, expected to be made public early this year, are believed to have damning evidence of bribes against top politicians in Brazil and possibly in other Latin American countries, including Argentina, Peru and Venezuela. \n \nTemer, who has been fingered in other plea bargains but never charged, could be removed by the electoral court if Odebrecht plea bargains detail illegal campaign financing that he has long been accused of accepting. Temer has denied wrongdoing. \n \n- AP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"'Car Wash' prosecutor says corruption probe to grow","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Jamaica Gleaner","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169811126","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"58"},"name":"Jamaica Gleaner","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194962668","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Some of their efforts could help people around the world. \n \nAlready this year, the smog-shrouded capital has suffered particularly hazardous bouts of pollution caused mainly by coal burning and vehicle emissions. Like other Chinese cities, Beijing is trying to tackle the problem: City authorities say they will spend US$2.7 billion this year to help replace coal with natural gas, close heavily polluting factories, and take older vehicles off the road. \n \nOfficial figures show improvement since 2013, but Beijing has a long way to go. With no quick fix available, many residents developing their own partial solutions. Here are some of their ideas: \n \nFor the last four years, Zou Yi has diligently captured the sky's change in colours from the window of his central Beijing apartment, where he can - usually - see the landmark Beijing Television tower. The background in his photos runs from dirty brown to deep grey, interspersed with one or more days of cobalt blue. On the worst days, nearby buildings can't be seen. \n \nA 10-day period of particularly heavy pollution inspired his project. The government had just started publishing data on levels of PM2.5 tiny particulate matter that can clog lungs and a taboo on state media's discussion of the sensitive topic had just been lifted. \n \n\"I couldn't go out, I couldn't open windows, I couldn't see the building next to me because the smog was so bad,\" he said. \n \nZou shared the photos on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo and the smartphone messaging app WeChat. He found his friends had similar feelings of frustration and recruited his building manager to take the pictures when he was out of town. \n LARGE AUDIENCE  \n\"They wanted me to share a photo with them every day, so I did it every day, every month,\" said Zou, 50. Hundreds of thousands of people have seen his photos on social media. \n \nWhat started as a way to complain has morphed into his full-time passion. This month, Zou set up the non-governmental organisation BeijingAirNow to work with scientists on technology to read pollution levels from around the world by analysing the tint in the images rather than using expensive monitoring equipment to collect air particles. He says he is handing over more than 300,000 photos for computer analysis. \n \nWang Jiang, 42, and her family had eight air purifiers at home, yet found that the indoor air quality was still not good enough on heavy pollution days. Then they decided to take their efforts up a notch. \n \nBut sealing windows and doors and turning on the purifiers caused carbon dioxide levels to spike, leaving Wang to wake up last year with headaches while pregnant with her second daughter. \n \nSo now they have installed a US$5,000 industrial-grade filtration system that sucks in outdoor air, cleans it via three filters and distributes it around the house through newly fitted pipes. They filled in vents from their building's central heating system and installed their own. \n \nWhile some might find that extreme, it's an increasingly popular solution. Filter manufacturer Yuanda says their customers range from the ruling Communist Party's Central Committee to homes and about 1,000 kindergartens and schools. \n \nA marketing representative, who only gave his surname, Hu, said their purifying systems often go out of stock. \n \n\"If you order one today, it won't get installed until March,\" Hu said. \n \nNow Wang, a coffee importer, can exercise on a living room treadmill when pollution is bad without worrying about her health. \n \nHer husband, Frenchman Ludovic Bodin, 38, said he thinks every house should have an air filtering and ventilation system pre-installed. \"At least if you cannot secure outdoors because it takes time ... at least try to secure the house inside,\" he said. \n \nFrenchman and long-term Beijing resident Yann Boquillod wanted to know what kind of air his five children were breathing at home, so he developed a portable air-quality monitor. It also tells users when carbon dioxide levels are high from sealing rooms too tightly, and advises that they should open windows for 10 minutes even if there is pollution outside. \n REAL-TIME MAP  \nBoquillod's start-up, AirVisual, also provides air-pollution readings around the world using data from more than 10,000 monitoring sources, both public and \n \nprivate. The company shares a \n \n3-D real-time global map of air pollution and weather patterns on its website. \n \nOn the website Wednesday, easily the largest mass of unhealthy levels of PM2.5 pollution was a swath that covered much of eastern China, from Beijing in the north to Kunming in the south. \n \nBoquillod, 39, sees this as an educational tool and means of self-protection. He consults with schools, hospitals and offices to test air quality and find gaps in door and window frames that could allow pollution in. \n \n\"The most important thing is to first start by monitoring the air quality, and from that, we can take the right decisions on what kind of air purifiers to install (and) know about the leakage inside the building,\" he said. \n \nChildren as young as 3 at Ivy Bilingual School know they need to wear face masks when the smog is bad. The school also invites mask makers to come in and cut open masks to demonstrate which ones have extra layers and are better for their health. The children can even educate their parents on the masks and how to fit them, said campus director Victoria Li. \n \nThe school monitors pollutant levels and instructs teachers to make sure windows are closed 15 minutes before school starts to give the air purifiers time to work. It also puts up green or red signs indicating whether children can go out and play. \n \nSome international schools in Beijing have installed air-inflated sports domes for athletics, complete with air filters and rotating doors to help keep them sealed. \n \n- AP","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Environment news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Beijing news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"China news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Smog pushes Beijing residents to innovate for the world","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Jamaica Gleaner","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169811126","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"58"},"name":"Jamaica Gleaner","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194962835","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Cervi \n\nby Joe e. Cervi Sports \n \nA few years ago, I walked into the media center of a local high school and was immediately awash in colored balloons and streamers. \n \nThere was a long table with name cards. \n \nThere were dozens and dozens of people. \n \nThere were proud smiles that lit up the room. \n \nThere was confetti. \n \nThere was cake. \n \nThere were speeches about how the best of the best were now ready to take the next step. \n \nThis particular high school had a bumper crop of athletes. There were five in particular who stood above the rest. They were good in football, basketball, baseball and track. They were big, strong, fast and agile. \n \nThe losses these athletes experienced in high school mostly came deep in the postseason. They were that successful. It was fun watching them grow as they won. \n \nAnd they won often. \n \nThese were the multisport, can\u2019t-miss kids coaches dream about. \n \nTogether they decided to take their talents to the next level at Colorado State University-Pueblo. This budding Division II football program was getting the nucleus, the heart and soul, of one of the most successful prep football programs in the state. \n \nOn that day, national signing day, five of Pueblo\u2019s best declared that they were staying home. They wanted to play in front of friends and family. They wanted to be a part of the growth at CSU-Pueblo. \n \nThey were positive that their winning ways would continue in college. \n \nOf those five, only one stuck with the ThunderWolves. \n \nThat number was a little surprising, considering the talent those five possessed. \n \nBut one in five is about right. \n \nFor every five Pueblo kids who sign on the dotted line, one sticks it out. That is not a scientific fact, merely an educated guess from someone who has covered national sign day for more than a quarter-century. \n \nThe reasons athletes don\u2019t make it to the finish line are as varied as the athletes themselves. \n \nKids grow up and acquire other interests. They fall in love. They get jobs. Those who are good enough to earn college scholarships in sports have been playing those sports for so long that burnout is a real possibility. \n \nLife, and all that entails, far too often gets in the way. \n \nIf I had a dollar for every kid from Pueblo who signed a national letter of intent \u2014 junior college, NAIA, Division II, Division I, whatever \u2014 who didn\u2019t last their allotted time at said institution, I could buy my own damn cake. \n \nThat is not to label those athletes failures. Not at all. It is what it is \u2014 especially if those athletes aren\u2019t getting enough money to cover college and living expenses. \n \nIt takes a special kind of person, not just an athlete, to make it in intercollegiate athletics. \n \nTo student-athletes who will sign their name this Wednesday, national signing day, enjoy the moment and embrace the opportunity ahead. Smile for pictures that will, no doubt, add to the bulging scrapbooks. \n \nThen look beyond the decorations and see the bigger picture. Someone is willing to help you financially with your college education. \n \nRemember that. \n \nTake advantage of that. \n \nWhether you are getting a full ride at s a major university or a small stipend to help with tuition and books a tiny school in the middle of nowhere, someone saw enough in your abilities, your personality and your potential to help you take the next step in life. \n \nSo stay the course. Embrace the difficult. Work to finish what you started. \n \nImagine, then, just how sweet the cake will taste \u2014 when you graduate from college. \n \nChieftain Sports Editor Joe E.

Eventually, they were let to go, leading to their swearing-in by President Akufo-Addo later in the evening.\n\nThe president swore in 12 ministers, except Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, who was out of the country for official AU engagements in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n\nThe other three approved without any problems were Minister-designate for Education, Dr Mathew Opoku Prempeh; Minister-designate for Health, Kwaku Agyeman Manu and Minister-designate for Food and Agriculture, Dr Owusu Afriyie Akoto.\n\nThe argument of the minority for opposing the approval of the two nominees was that Mr Osafo-Maafo did not tell the committee the truth with regard to the alleged ethnocentric comments that he made in the Eastern Region to the effect that only people from the five resource-rich regions should be made to become presidents.\n\nIn addition, the minority also argued that the CNCTI loan which he (Osafo-Maafo) said was abrogated under his tenure as Minister of Finance (during President Kufuor\u2019s rule) was not a true reflection of things since according to the minority, their checks from records in parliament did not show that.\n\nThey also said that Minister-designate for Energy, Boakye Agyarko, had made a categorical statement before the committee that former President John Mahama was corrupt because he superintended over sole-sourcing of the Floating Storage and Re-Gasification Unit and was also said not to have provided the accurate figure on the debts of the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG).\n\nIn the course of the heated debate as to whether or not to approve the two nominees whose vetting had come under scrutiny, news starting spreading on the various media networks that a member of the Appointments Committee, Mahama Ayariga, had revealed to Radio Gold \u2013 a pro-NDC radio station in Accra \u2013 that the Minister-designate for Energy had attempted to bribe them with GH¢3,000 each but the chairman of the committee later told the House that it (committee) would respond appropriately to the allegation.\n\nChairman of the Committee, Joe Osei-Wusu, denied playing any role in the alleged bribery, vowing to take up the matter at the appropriate quarters.\n\nMahama Ayariga was said to have withdrawn the bribery allegation.\n\nAccording to parliamentary sources, Ayariga said he made the claim to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d because the nominee had impugned the reputation of former President John Mahama.\n\nThe Defence Minister-designate, Dominic Nitiwul, was very forceful in defending the two nominees, saying that those allegations against them were not accurate.\n\nHe said that the majority New Patriotic Party wanted a consensus building that was why the approval of the two was deferred to yesterday.\n\nHe said the majority has a huge numerical advantage and could have gone ahead and voted on the approval, but because parliament thrives on consensus building, they waited for more consultations and consensus building.\n\n\u201cWe have done all that we need to do in terms of consensus building and that if the minority wants to become impediment in forming our government then we can easily use our vast majority to approve the nominees,\u201d he said.\n\nThe majority leader, Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu, continued the path of consensus building and invited the leadership of both sides and also the leadership of the Appointments Committee to meet with the two nominees in the lobby of the speaker to resolve the issues amicably.\n\nAfter reaching a consensus the leadership returned and Haruna Iddrisu told the House that after a lengthy consultation, the Minister-designate decided to withdraw his statement of \u2018corruption\u2019 against the former president and also said that since he was a new person going into the ministry, figures given about the debt of ECG might not exactly be accurate and that he was aware that the total debt of ECG was GH¢2 billion instead of the GH¢800 million he mentioned to the committee.\n\nThe minority leader also said the Minister-designate for Energy agreed that the GH¢800 million debt was rather government indebtedness to ECG.\n\nHe also indicated that the Senior Minister-designate expressed regret over any such comment and that it was not his nature to stoke ethnocentrism in the country.\n\nHe said based on that the leadership of the minority accepted the explanations and therefore relaxed their stand for the two to be approved by parliament.\n\nHe expressed the hope that after being approved they would discharge their duties as true Ministers of State and not on partisan lines.\n\nThe speaker, Prof Mike Oquaye, thanked the leadership for showing such maturity.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society

And he had a 3-pointer, a three-point play and two free throws in an 11-1 run that gave Colorado a 64-52 lead. \n \nThe Buffs are just the third team to top 70 points against the Oregon this season. \n \nThe Ducks trailed 35-34 at halftime, just the fourth time they\u2019ve trailed at the break this season.

Jeremy Hemsley immediately took the inbounds pass and his 3-point attempt from the top of the arc hit the back of the rim at the buzzer. \n \nMalik Pope scored 19 points and Hemsley added 17 to pace San Diego State, which missed its final four field goals over the last 3:11. \n \nColorado State (14-8, 6-3 Mountain West) erased a 13-point second-half deficit in winning its third straight game. Emmanuel Omogbo added a career-best 24 points for the Rams. \n \nThe Aztecs (11-9, 3-5) saw their 13-game home winning streak against Colorado State snapped.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Buffs upend No. 10 Ducks","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Pueblo","zipCode":"81003","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Pueblo","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Pueblo Chieftain Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169701228","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"576"},"name":"Pueblo Chieftain Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.chieftain.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194967364","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:06:38Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Without funds for an attorney, I accepted deferred probation. It has followed me my entire life. \n \nI graduated from college, law, and graduate school, yet I had to endure a hearing to ascertain my fitness to practice. It also caused employment rejection. \n \nLater, as assistant county attorney in El Paso, and elected district attorney in Willacy County, I routinely dismissed pot cases. Prosecutor\u2019s offices have limited budgets, yet mountains of cases. Dismissing marijuana offenses, allowed me to send more dangerous criminals to prison. \n \nEven probation for pot was wasteful. Curfews and reporting requirements should be for prowlers and burglars, not pot smokers. \n \nThis problem persists, as 620,000 Americans were arrested for pot last year. Yes, illegal marijuana creates jobs for probation officers, prosecutors, bailiffs, chemists, clerical staff and many more; however taxpayers get soaked. \n \nCalifornia and three other states legalized marijuana on Nov. 8. Voters were persuaded by the Colorado experience, where $2.4 billion in revenues and 17,000 jobs were created in legalization\u2019s first year. Some of this boom comes from visiting Texans. \n \nThe Denver Post polled, \u201cWould you repeal legalization?\u201d The answer; \u201cNo\u201d, by a 51 percent to 36 percent margin. Gallup\u2019s 2016 poll showed support for legalization has grown to 60 percent nationally, and recent studies demonstrate no increased use among youngsters since legalization. Colorado is booming, and other states want what they\u2019re smoking. \n \nThe old \u201cReefer Madness\u201d arguments against marijuana have been dispelled. Today\u2019s legalization opponents such as Insys Therapeutics, which develops synthetic painkillers, poured $500,000 into the \u201cNo\u201d vote in Arizona. It\u2019s these legal painkillers which cause so much addiction and harm. \n \nPrescription drugs increase our health costs and Big Pharma doesn\u2019t want competition. The Catholic Church was also a huge contributor, with the Boston Archdiocese donating $850,000 to oppose Massachusetts\u2019 marijuana initiative. \n \nOne lingering anti-pot argument is that people will ingest and drive. This happens anyway and it will be illegal everywhere. \n \nNot satisfied, opponents wonder how they will test for marijuana. Field tests still work, but how about we just arm each officer with a chocolate bar, and they could cuff the stoned drivers as they grab for it. \n \nLegalization will come eventually, as it\u2019s only the oldest age groups who are opposed. \n \nAn estimated 15 million Americans use marijuana regularly, and about half our population has admitted trying marijuana. \n \nMarijuana decriminalization bills for the 2017 Texas Legislature, have been filed, including one by El Paso\u2019s own Joe Moody. \n \nRepublicans are increasingly in favor, because of the fiscal benefits and individual freedom arguments. Democrats are already there, and almost everyone wants to decrease the power of the violent drug cartels who smuggle pot across our border. \n \nLet\u2019s legalize it, and have Mexico put up the wall to keep Texans from trafficking marijuana into their country. \n \nEl Paso attorney Steve Fischer has been a professor of criminology and a Texas State Bar director.

Unfortunately, it is accompanied by an anti-business attitude among many Jamaicans who often vilify successful businessmen as rapacious and dishonest and believe their wealth is attributed to ganja exporting. \n \nThis attitude is also part of a wider social envy directed at people who have raised themselves to middle class status. \n \nDeveloping countries are perennially short of capital and Jamaica has been able to boost its economic development by inflows of foreign investment, notably the bauxite-alumina and tourism industries. \n \nForeign investment has costs and benefits and the ledger has to be tallied in regard to the net impact on production, productive capacity, profits, employment, taxation, exports, foreign exchange, use of local materials, worker rights, local culture, environment and national sovereignty. \n \nNo investor, foreign or local, is perfect or without fault. It is the role of the Government to regulate how investors operate to ensure that, while they make a reasonable return, the country is the net beneficiary. \n \nWhat determines if Jamaica benefits from foreign investments and by how much depends on three key factors: \n \nFirst, the Government of Jamaica must establish the rules under which foreign investors operate and must negotiate the specific terms and conditions governing the operation of each specific investment project. \n \nSecond, investors have to be monitored by the Government to ensure that the laws of the land are being fully complied with and third, there is no point just monitoring if there are no consequences for breaches. \n \nSuccessive governments of Jamaica have known these requirements but the record of application leaves much to be desired. A good illustration is foreign investment in bauxite mining and alumina processing. Jamaica benefited tremendously but there are lessons to be learnt. \n \nThe Government did not establish clear and comprehensive conditions \u2014possibly because of incompetence or desperation to get the investment, hence the low tax revenue from the deal as well as the environmentally unfriendly mud lakes. And even when there was some monitoring, there were no consequences for not cleaning up the red mud. \n \nLocal investors can also operate in a way which is harmful. A good example is the cement company when it was Jamaican-owned. \n \nAnxious to have cement produced in Jamaica, the Government of the day allowed the company to be established at Rockfort in East Kingston. The company has never been held to account for adding to the pollution of the seventh- largest natural harbour in the world and creating an unhealthy fog over Kingston. \n \nForeign investment is essential for the economic development of Jamaica but unregulated investment \u2014 foreign or local \u2014 can be detrimental to our national interests.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Jamaica news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Unregulated foreign investment can be harmful","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Caribbean","countryCode":"JM","country":"Jamaica"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Jamaica Observer","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661192","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"67"},"name":"Jamaica Observer","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.jamaicaobserver.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194968588","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

After a high-profile battle between two stalwarts\u2013BJP\u2019s Arun Jaitley and Congress\u2019 Amarinder Singh in 2014\u2013the Amritsar Lok Sabha bypoll this year is seeing a low-profile but high-stakes contest with the parties leaving no stoned unturned to ensure their victory. The three-cornered fight between Congress, BJP-SAD combine and AAP has been overshadowed as the by-poll will be held simultaneously with the Assembly polls in the state on February 4. The by-poll has been necessitated after Amarinder resigned as an MP in protest against the Supreme Court verdict on the SYL Canal water sharing agreement. Of the over 14 lakh electorates registered in Amritsar LS seat, 60 per cent are Sikh voters, and the three parties have not ignored this fact. They have fielded candidates who belong to the Sikh community and hail from the holy city, which is famous, among other things, for the Golden temple, Attari-Wagah border, the Jallianwala Bagh and for its food. 66-year-old BJP\u2019s Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina, Congress\u2019 Gurjit Singh Aujla (44) and AAP\u2019s Upkar Singh Sandhu(63) are among those in the fray.\n\nChhina, who is considered close to Union minister Arun Jaitley, has formerly served BJP as its state unit\u2019s vice president and is now its executive member. Chhina had unsuccessfully contested the 2007 Assembly polls from the Amritsar-West seat. Aujla, considered close to Amarinder, was appointed vice president of the Amritsar District Youth Congress in 1997 and has been District Congress Committee (Rural) president since 2013. AAP\u2019s Sandhu (63), who was formerly with SAD, had a brief three-month stint with the Congress before he joined Arvind Kejriwal-led party earlier this month.\n\nSandhu had resigned from SAD earlier in protest against the sacrilege incidents in the state and alleged failure of the state government in nabbing the culprits. Starting from Gurmukh Singh Musafir and then R L Bhatia, Amritsar Lok Sabha had traditionally remained a Congress bastion until a young Najvot Singh Sidhu (now 53) as a BJP candidate trounced Congress veteran and six-time parliamentarian Bhatia in 2004 LS polls. The seat remained with Sidhu till 2014 when he made way for Jaitley to contest the Lok Sabha polls. Jaitley lost the seat to Amarinder. Cricketer-turned-politician Sidhu remained the BJP MP from Amritsar, winning the seat in 2004, 2007 by-poll and in 2009.\n\nThe Amritsar parliamentary constituency comprises nine assembly segments. Five (Amritsar-East, Amritsar-West, Amritsar-North, Amritsar-Central and Amritsar-South) are in the Amritsar city and surrounding areas, four (Ajnala, Majitha, Raja Sansi and Attari) are outside it. Of the nine, Raja Sansi, Amritsar-West, Amritsar-Central are with Congress. Amritsar-East\u2019s BJP MLA Navjot Kaur Sidhu and South\u2019s Inderbir Singh Bolaria of SAD have also switched over to Congress.\n\nMajitha, Ajnala and Attari are represented by SAD and Amritsar-North by BJP. In his election meetings, Chhina promises to transform Amritsar and bring projects for various sections and also to take steps to further boost the tourism. \u201cThis city has been declared as a Smart City but work is yet to get started, which I will ensure gets started at priority. We want to make Amritsar a top city and a top tourist destination,\u201d he said. He said the border areas need more work on education and health services and he would seek a special package. Chhina promises development of border areas through Central grants and compensation for farmers with land across the barbed-wire fence on international border.\n\n\u201cOnce the SAD-BJP form the government for the third consecutive time in the state and you elect a BJP-SAD MP from here, it will further speed-up the works for public good,\u201d Chhina said. In his campaigns, he also enlists development projects like Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Horticulture Institute and Smart City project. He claimed the beautification of Golden Temple by the SAD-BJP government has boosted the tourist influx. Congress\u2019 Aujla has been raising the drug issue to hit out at the ruling Akalis, saying the menace is prevalent but the government has \u201cfailed\u201d to acknowledge it, \u201cleave alone taking any step to combat it\u201d.\n\nSidhu\u2019s step of recently joining the Congress has also bolstered the party\u2019s campaign. He has been going all out to attack the ruling Badal family for \u201clooting\u201d Punjab, and BJP for \u201cacting like a mute spectator\u201d to the whole thing. AAP\u2019s Sandhu says his party is the \u201conly hope\u201d for Punjab and could bring back its \u201cgolden days\u201d. \u201cWe all have seen the regimes of Congress and SAD-BJP. AAP is not just a political party but a new hope for all of Punjab\u2019s ills,\u201d he said. Also dubbing Sidhu and Singh as \u201cabsentee MPs\u201d, Chhina said they \u201cignored\u201d the constituency and did not bring \u201ceven one notable\u201d development project for the area.\n\n\u201cSidhu remained three-time MP but did not visit the constituency for months together. Let him say what project he got during 10 years as MP. He was not available to his constituents but for most of the time he remained busy with other commitments. \u201cNow, he is contesting the MLA election from Amritsar-East but he will lose to BJP candidate because he stands exposed for his opportunism. He just makes headlines in newspapers during poll time and then flies back to Mumbai which is his permanent base in a way now,\u201d Chhina had told PTI on the sidelines of a public meeting here.\n\nChhina, who is also secretary of the powerful and historic Khalsa College Governing Council (KCGC), said Singh, \u201chardly attended Parliament and never raised voice on the issues facing people here\u201d. Addressing poll meetings, Aujla of Congress says the development of the holy city as a tourist, industrial and business hub will be his main agenda. He promises to make holy city an education hub by opening more and more government schools and colleges, especially in the rural belt.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Punjab polls: After Arun Jaitley vs Amarinder Singh in 2014, Amritsar sees low-profile LS bypoll","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Indian Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660698","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"Indian Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194973491","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:15:28Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/amarinder-jaitley-480.jpg?w=450"},{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/amarinder-jaitley-480.jpg?w=480"}],"video":[]}}

A Queens Supreme Court judge indicated Diaz would be sentenced on Feb. 1 to 17 years in prison followed by five years post release supervision. \n\n\u201cThe defendant admitted to doing the unthinkable - killing her own child,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIn the short two years of the victim\u2019s life, she suffered greatly. Bruises, abrasions and lacerations covered her tiny body. She was shaken violently and her brain was severely damaged and her liver lacerated. The defendant will be incarcerated for a very long time.\u201d\n\nAccording to the charges, at 5:30 p.m. on Feb. 3, 2014 a neighbor was watching daughter Kevasia Edwards as Diaz left the apartment to buy groceries. At the time the toddler was asleep, when she woke up the baby sitter noticed she was pale and lethargic, Brown said. \n\nLater in the afternoon at 11:15 p.m. the baby sitter received a call from Diaz telling her Kevasia was not breathing and unresponsive, the DA said. The baby sitter returned to Diaz apartment and began CPR , she observed the toddler\u2019s face, which appeared to be red and bruised, her lip was bleeding and teeth were missing, according to the DA.\n\nKevasia was taken to St. John\u2019s Episcopal Hospital in cardiac arrest where she was pronounced dead, Brown said. The toddler had both old and fresh bruising on her face, legs and torso, two of her ribs had been fractured and there were burn marks, according to medical personnel. The injuries were inconsistent with the history given by Diaz, who told doctors her daughter had a seizure and fell to the ground, Brown said. \n\nAccording to the charges, Diaz told officials that her daughter was acting normally and in good health during the time she was the sole caregiver \u2013 from Friday, January 31, 2014, until February\n\n3, 2014. Diaz said that at 9:30 p.m. on Feb. 3 Kevasia had a seizure and fell to the ground and became unresponsive, she admitted that she sat by her daughter for at least 30 minutes while the child was unresponsive and not breathing and that she did not call anyone for help until after 11:00 p.m., District Attorney Brown said. \n\nAccording to the autopsy report issued by the Medical Examiner, Kevasia suffered multiple fresh and old bruising to her face, neck, torso and legs, multiple scalp abrasions and lacerations, multiple scars of varying ages about her body and other markings consistent with trauma. She also suffered subdural bleeding, hemorrhaging resulting from multiple impacts of varying ages underneath the scalp, bilateral optical nerve sheath hemorrhages, hemorrhage resulting from impact to her lower back, two healing rib fractures and traumatic liver injuries, the Medical Examiner said. The autopsy report preliminary medical findings were consistent with Abusive Head Trauma with multiple, violent impacts to her head and body, Brown said. \n\nReach Gina Martinez by e-mail at gmartinez@cnglocal.com or by phone at (718) 260\u20134566.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Gina Martinez"},"topics":[],"title":"[FAR ROCKAWAY] Far Rockaway mom pleads guilty to killing 2-year-old daughter","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Queens","zipCode":"11361","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bayside","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TimesLedger","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"245167452","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"148"},"name":"TimesLedger","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.timesledger.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194974453","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.timesledger.com/assets/photos/2017/4/rockawaymom_2017_01_27_q01_z.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport be released ended happily when a Brooklyn judge blocked a decree by President Trump to keeping the travelers out. \n\nResidents high-tailed it to the Downtown Brooklyn courthouse as news of the emergency hearing spread through social media at 7 pm, and by the time the court\u2019s decision came down at 9 pm, a packed Cadman Plaza East near the base of the Brooklyn Bridge erupted with people singing, chanting, and cheering alongside a live brass band. \n\n\u201cIt was a party feeling,\u201d said Marika Plater, who lives in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to see this response to all the anger that\u2019s out there right now.\u201d\n\nInside, Judge Ann Donnelly had to shush whoops as she granted a temporary stay on the orders Trump signed on Thursday that bans citizens of Syria and six other Muslim countries from entering the U.S. \u2014 declaring that those turned back could face \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d while their threat to this country is low given authorities had considered them perfectly safe enough for visas, green cards, or refugee status just days earlier.\n\n\u201cIf they had come in two days ago, we wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d said Donnelly.\n\nSomewhere between 100 and 200 people (even the Feds\u2019 lawyers claimed they didn\u2019t know exactly) were being held at airports around America on Saturday \u2014 including around a dozen at John F. Kennedy Airport in Queens, where hundreds of protestors also gathered throughout the day to demand they be let it.\n\nUltimately, two were released in New York, although Donnelly\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the rest will be freed, lawyers warned \u2014 they could be held in detention until the case is actually heard on Feb. 21. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of time to be sitting in a detention center,\u201d said Anthony Romero, head of the American Civil liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit.\n\nStill, the returning legal eagles received a hero\u2019s welcome from locals, who said they were sickened by the thought of residents being denied entry to the land of the free.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just horrified that people are being detained at JFK, we are a country of immigrants,\u201d said Prospect-Lefferts Gardens resident Carolyn Bost while fighting back tears. \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable what he\u2019s doing. I don\u2019t know what to tell my 10-year-old daughter.\u201d\n\nThe Brooklynites acknowledged they still have a long fight ahead, but were buoyed by the court\u2019s decision and how many of their neighbors had turned out in support. \n\n\u201cThis is just so beautiful, I am just so proud,\u201d said Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D\u2013Brooklyn), who spent the whole day at Kennedy Airport with Rep. Jerry Nadler (D\u2013Manhattan and Brooklyn). \u201cNow we have to bring justice to all the refugees who are escaping violence in their countries to be here \u2014 this is who we are.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ruth Brown and Lauren Gill"},"topics":[{"name":"New York metro area news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"}],"title":"TRUMPED:Protests at JFK, then party at Brooklyn courthouse after judge lets in refugees","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Queens","zipCode":"11361","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bayside","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TimesLedger","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"245167452","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"148"},"name":"TimesLedger","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.timesledger.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695194974630","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:19:44Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.timesledger.com/assets/photos/2017/5/jfk-protest-2017-02-03-tl02_z.jpg"}],"video":[]}}
