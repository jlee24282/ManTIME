This semi-fluid, half-lotion serum brings together a trio of hyaluronic acid, the benchmark molecule approved by dermatologists and used in optimum concentrations to effectively act on crepey and wrinkled skin. Hyaluronic acid helps to maintain optimum levels of hydration within the skin by trapping water in deep layers, in the same way as a sponge, strengthening skin cohesion and increasing firmness. Over time, hyaluronic acid contained in the body decreases by half, making WRINKLE DIMENSION an appropriate year-round solution to provide maturing and wrinkled skin with a perfect supply of hyaluronic acid for an instantly rejuvenating effect. \n \nWRINKLES DIMENSION HYALURONIC ACID CONCENTRATE\u202615 ml, suggested retail price $100.50 \n \nDirections for use: apply several drops before face cream, morning and evening. \n \nKey ingredients: \n \n\u2022Hyaluronic Acid Trio: \n\n Encapsulated High Molecular Weight Hyaluronic Acid \u2013 deep wrinkles are filled and hollow areas are volumized thanks to the strategic shape and controlled release of ingredient.  Low Molecular Weight Hyaluronic Acid \u2013 small molecules of hyaluronic acid penetrate skin layers, swell on contact with water and accumulate to fill fine lines, smoothing surface wrinkles.  High Molecular Weight Hyaluronic Acid \u2013 plays a vital role in regulating skin hydration thanks to its strong water-retaining power. Skin is moisturized and transepidermal water loss is stopped.  \nVie Collection at a glance : \n\nAs a cosmeceutical expert in the spa industry, Vie Collection is a high performance, high-end skin care line focused on bridging the gap between traditional cosmetics and esthetic medicine.

In addition to showing Miller\u2019s paintings, Art Ventures will exhibit a suite of drawings, drenched in mystery and never before published. Combined with the dreamlike magic of his paintings, these drawings provide glimpses of something mystic and profound. Paton Miller will be attending the opening February 1st, and will be available for media interviews, upon appointment. \n \nAccording to Art Ventures Gallery Director Katharina Powers, \u201cWhat strikes me looking at Paton Miller\u2019s artwork is the purity of his dramatic landscapes. Paton provides an antidote to the so-called \u201cfilter bubble\u201d in which this generation, growing up with the Internet, lives. Paton\u2019s work provides a respite from the Internet and takes us out of algorithmized isolation. He takes us on a journey, and shows us what life is about.\u201d \n \nWriting in Art News, noted critic Donald Kuspit, said about Paton Miller\u2019s work, \u201cThese pictures make clear a familiar, but often forgotten point: that the expressivity of a representational scene often depends upon the abstract intensity generated in response to the medium. Without this visionary intensity, representational painting can become a kind of perceptual journalism. It becomes all the more important when the artist is picturing inner rather than overt horror. The achievement of ecstatic abstractness also indicates that the artist is master of the scene, rather than overwhelmed by what she or he is rendering \u2014 to make it appear magically upon command, which is what Miller\u2019s version of realism does.\u201d \n \nPaton Miller\u2019s work has been awarded the Painting Award at the Florence Biennale and is in public collections at American Embassy in Abu Dhabi and Bogotá, Colombia. Recent exhibitions include shows at White Room Gallery, NYC; Gallery Shchunkin, NYC; Galerie Yoram Gil, Beverly Hills; and Horwitch Newman Gallery, Scottsdale, AZ. \n \nFollowing the opening of his exhibit at the Art Ventures Gallery in Menlo Park, Miller will be in residence at the Art Ventures studio in Saint Helena from July through August. While there, Miller can engage with other visiting artists in the residency program, and create new work. In a program unique in the Bay Area art world, Art Ventures invites rising art stars from Europe to work shoulder to shoulder with their Californian colleagues in a purpose-built painting studio. Following their studio residency artists are invited to curate their own solo show at the Art Ventures Gallery exhibition space. \n \nThe result is groundbreaking: part exhibition space and part art movement. \n \nFor more information about Paton Miller and Art Ventures Gallery email info(at)artventuresgallery(dot)com \n\nArt Ventures Gallery is located at 888 Santa Cruz Avenue, Menlo Park, CA 94025. Paton Millers Artwork will be on display from February 1, 2017 through February 25. A reception for the artist will be held at Art Ventures Gallery Wednesday, February 1, from 5 pm to 7 pm. All press and media are welcome. \n \nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb140231","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Top News US Full Feed"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Art Ventures Gallery Announces Inaugural Exhibition, Against (the) Algorithm\u2014Around The World In 40 Years","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"SSUChronicle.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"606907479","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"14"},"name":"SSUChronicle.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ssuchronicle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb14023107.htm","http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb140231"],"sequenceId":"695204584245","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

That Living Zen is transmitting in quantum leap in global conscious communication on the path of grit with life principles in character and integrity. \n \nHe continued that Living Zen with quantum health teachings through many cities in Anhui, China and all the way to China's capital Beijing. He did not finish his first Asian Zen teaching series until Jan 12 when he did 2nd seminar and discipleship acceptance ceremony in Shanghai, traveling through Korea before he reached his 2017 first teaching stop in Washington D.C. on January 12th 2017. \n \nOn January 14th -15th in Washington D.C.he started his US teaching series on \"Living Zen\" with the theme of High Conscious Health Living and Natural Healing before his US southern teaching tour series. \n \nThe Asian New Year of Rooster teaching tour series on Living Zen with the theme of \u201c5H\u201d started from Shaolin Institute Atlanta campus on January 28th, New Orleans on February 4th, and Mobile, AL on February 8th. In this set of teaching series, he places the focus on \u201cLet it go so one can rise up with high consciousness.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt is time to let go of over-thinking and problem searching，\u201d said DeRu, \u201cTo free ourselves from boundaries and self caging is to grow our strength in character, trustworthiness, and responsibilities. That is to be truly free.\u201d as he stressed his statement. \n \n\u201cHappiness with a health body and a health mind is almost what everyone wishes to possess,\u201d as the Zen master clarified, \u201cHigh conscious intelligence, from Healing to Health with Harmony and Happiness penetrates and permeates into all the communities of Zen world, further prevailing into all conscious beings around the globe.\u201d \n \nAccording to DeRu, Zen sees one conscious world, and one conscious being with one breath and one source of origin, from nothing to everything, expanding to apparent visible world as one sees with naked eye. However; the invisible potentiality is unlimited and infinite. The high conscious intelligence continues its path to infinite potentiality to everlasting-limitless universe. \n \nDeRu further explained: \"Zen sees the reality of potentiality is in the emptiness within and between the visible worlds. It is that emptiness of potentiality makes the universe going with consistent and constant expanding in infinity.\" \n \nThis is how the Zen Master sees the world, \"The high conscious mind of the universe guides and decides the direction of the universe expansion and development. When one follows the heart of the high conscious universe, one believes and achieves one\u2019s dream with unwavering faith and confidence. One will eventually be intotal communication and merge with that of infinite oneness.\" \n \n\u201cIt is that Zen mind propagates and instigates Imagination which opens the 3rd eye to vision the infinite Potentiality of the true reality of the universe.\" according to DeRu. \u201cWe are all part of, and microcosm of the universe. Our body particles are universal participles and our atoms are part of the universe atoms. Our conscious Qi waves are closely connected with the Qi waves of the universe consciousness which set the parameter to guide each step of our path if we wish to discover within the happiness and health.\u201d \n \nZen philosophy along with Zen way of living has been in lead in high conscious living beings for thousands of years. Zen Master DeRu sees Quantum theory along with scientific experiment of quantum physics gives lights, like taking many pictorial shots of reality of the world, to ordinary conscious beings, believers and non believers alike to observe and see the truth of the world, and the conscious universe in communication and expansion with unlimited potentiality without time or space limitations. \n \nDeRu firmly believes, \"In that Zen world one begins to see, In lieu of the fittest and fiercest fight for victory and survival with competitiveness from the selected few, humanity leading all conscious beings together claim victory by synergy and cooperation with compassion and love.\u201d \n \nDeRu maintains, \"war and fierce competition is for ignorant self-serving few, leading to self-destruction, it is, he said, the synergy in peace with harmony in cooperation leading all beings to greater development in advancement of conscious beings.\" \n \n\"Leaving Newton as a hero of the past,\" he insists, \"we must move on, following vision of the Ancient Chan in all conscious, subconscious and superconscious communication, human beings shall explore further. seeing beyond and through that visible illusionary world into that true universe intelligence and wisdom, and see the true potential world beyond time and space with the guidance of Albert Einstein, Max Planck and Niels Bohr\u2019s scientific minds.\" \n \nMaster Shi DeRu a 31 generation Shaolin Chan (Zen) Master has been teaching Living Zen Mind and Zen meditation with TaGong for over three decades worldwide, especially in China and the US. \n \nHe has been hosting his Annual Qi Retreat in the US for the last two decades with various theme topics on health and happy living. This year he will conduct his seminar workshop with the theme of Health, Healing and Happiness from March 3rd to March 6th at Pensacola Beach, Florida. for details visit: shaolin-world.net, 770-286-9808 \n \nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb14017141.htm","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Benzinga Full Feed"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"New Orleans news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"China news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"January 29, 2017","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"SSUChronicle.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"606907479","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"14"},"name":"SSUChronicle.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ssuchronicle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb14017141.htm"],"sequenceId":"695204585736","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But they're better right now. Until we improve, they're going to keep beating us.\" \n\nRivers mostly sat and witnessed his team go down in the third quarter under an avalanche of Stephen Curry three-point slings and Warriors points that sent the Clippers to their eighth consecutive defeat to Golden State. \n\n\"If I won eight games in a row, I would have a mental edge,\" Rivers said. \n\nCurry, supposedly playing with a sore left quadriceps, detonated for 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter. He was five for eight from three-point range in the period, during which he seemed to be playing alone. \n\nFor the game he was 15 for 23 from the field, nine for 15 from three-point range. \n\nOf all the 72 points the Clippers surrendered in the first half, the most painful had to be when Curry eased up the court and casually and knowingly hoisted a three-pointer from half court that splashed through the net as the halftime buzzer sounded. \n\nThe fans went crazy. The Warriors celebrated, none more so than Draymond Green, who chest-bumped Curry so hard he fell on the court. Curry stayed on his belly for a few seconds, his arms extended. \n\nThe Clippers could only solemnly trudge to their locker room. \n\n\"We can talk about, like, being who we are. But who are we?\" Clippers guard J.J. Redick said. \"To me, we're the most inconsistent team, maybe in the league. Like, we're inconsistent. That's who we are. So, like, if we're going to be inconsistent, we can't expect to come in here and play these guys and be inconsistent and play well. It's not realistic.\" \n\nThe Clippers have lost four of five games since point guard Chris Paul had surgery for a torn thumb ligament that is expected to sideline him six to eight weeks. \n\nBut they will see the Warriors again Thursday night at Staples Center knowing it's going to take a better effort than this one. \n\nBlake Griffin, in his second game back after missing 18 games following right knee surgery, had 20 points for a Clippers team that was never in this game. \n\nThe total destruction by the Warriors notwithstanding, Rivers has been unsure what has put him in a weakened state. \n\n\"It has been three weeks now, so it's not been a fun stretch,\" he said. \"I'll get through it. I just want to find out what the hell it is to be honest.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BRODERICK TURNERLos Angeles Times"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Golden State Warriors news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Los Angeles Clippers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Curry, Warriors clobber Clippers, 144-98","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sacramento","zipCode":"95816","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Sacramento","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Sacramento Bee","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169672618","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4516"},"name":"Sacramento Bee","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sacbee.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204586308","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

If Britain\u2019s agonised liberal elite think of any of the Brexiters as cocksure, the name Daniel Hannan would surely top the list. The Conservative MEP is the high priest of Eurosceptics \u2014 a stiff Shakespeare-obsessive for whom self-doubt would appear to come as naturally as a double-backflip. \n \nFlip through one of Hannan\u2019s many eloquent books, and you will find a dreamy blueprint for Brexit. In this world the clouds of negotiations clear, parliamentary supremacy shines, and we \"stride into the sunlight\". \n \n\"I\u2019d probably been planning for [Brexit] longer than almost anyone,\" he tells me at one point over lunch. Later he adds: \"I just think there is so much irrational pessimism in the world.\" \n \nSome politicians are Marmite. Hannan is acupuncture \u2014 you either believe in him or you don\u2019t, in which case it all feels needlessly painful. The liberal New Statesman magazine has a regular column, \"What is Daniel Hannan demonstrably wrong about this week?\" ; it is still to run short of material. Even some on his own side are wary of his obsessiveness. Senior figures in Vote Leave, the official Out campaign in June\u2019s referendum, scornfully labelled him \"the world\u2019s greatest debater\", and left him out of the big televised showdowns. \"We tried to keep him away from important decisions,\" said one. \n \nAnd yet Hannan, 45, was unquestionably central to the biggest decision of all. When he started as a student activist in the early 1990s, leaving the EU was a fringe movement; he helped turn it into mainstream Conservative thinking. \"He persuaded the Conservative party person by person,\" says a friend. \"His genius is persuading people, without them realising they\u2019re being persuaded.\" I\u2019m not sure how they don\u2019t realise: I\u2019ve met suited men with cropped hair and name badges who are less evangelical. \n \nAlmost before sitting down, Hannan is detailing his methods. \"Politics is didactic,\" he starts. I quickly order a glass of wine. \"Not for me, I\u2019ve got a very busy day,\" he says. The European Parliament will not wreck itself. \n  \nBrussels is the belly of Hannan\u2019s beast, home to the tens of thousands of bureaucrats and politicians who run the European Union. But he actually quite likes the place. \"First of all, the food is very good,\" he says, before moving on to the \"very affordable\" housing \u2014 and an obligatory moan about the weather. \"There is 30 per cent more rainfall here than in London, which is a lot if you think about it. Awful lot.\" \n \nWe are in a chic neighbourhood dotted with Art Deco and Art Nouveau façades, a couple of miles from the EU institutions. Hannan and his family used to live nearby; his daughters attended one of the European Schools free for EU employees. \"I\u2019ve tried to stop using Brussels as a shorthand for what I don\u2019t like about the EU. It\u2019s a slur against this really rather handsome and good-tempered town,\" he says. Later he confesses the only English thing he really missed was the countryside. \n \nThe restaurant consists of eight simple tables, tiled floors and walls, and two huge windows overlooking a quiet crossroads. It\u2019s perfect, I think, before Hannan points out the old meat hooks near the ceiling. \"It used to be a butcher\u2019s, as you can see.\" A non-meat-eater, I belatedly recognise the type of continental restaurant where the first six letters of végétarien are silent.\" \n \nThe first two of the main courses are steak,\" says Hannan, translating the menu. \"Then breast of duck. \u2026 veal sweetbread. \u2026 normal veal with mushrooms.. .\" \n \nI\u2019ve absolutely no idea where Culoiseau is,\" he continues, raising my spirits momentarily, \"but I\u2019d imagine La Poularde de Culoiseau is some kind of chicken.\" \n \nSod it: as Sarah Palin put it, if God had not intended for us to eat animals, how come he made them out of meat? I swallow hard, and order the only bloodless thing on the menu \u2014 a poached egg with mushrooms \u2014 followed by something random I can pronounce. To my slight horror, it turns out to be veal sweetbread. Hannan goes for the poached egg and the duck. \n \nLike all ardent patriots, Hannan grew up abroad \u2014 he is possibly the most famous Peruvian immigrant in London since Paddington. His mother was a diplomat, his father an expat farmer threatened with expropriation. The experience pushed him towards conservatism, even before he started at a British public school. It was Enoch Powell who first inspired Hannan to question Brussels, and the Maastricht treaty that convinced him Britain needed to leave. As a history student at Oxford, he wrote furiously against the Exchange Rate Mechanism. When the Conservative party signed up to it, he concluded the experts didn\u2019t always know best. \"Nobody likes a smart alec,\" he sighs. \"Which is why it\u2019s always better for your career to be wrong and in company rather than right and on your own.\" \n \nHannan is still a relative loner. His version of Brexit-wooing Remainers, staying within the European Free Trade Association, criticising Donald Trump \u2014 contrasts sharply with the nativism of Nigel Farage. His latest book, What Next, sets out his agenda for Brexit Britain \u2014 including free trade, tax cuts, low regulation, localism and direct democracy. These Singapore-style reforms are \"by far the most important\" part of Brexit, he claims; they bear some resemblance to what Theresa May has threatened, if Britain is unable to secure a favourable deal with the EU. \n \nWhat changes would he have made to the prime minister\u2019s long-awaited Brexit speech, delivered earlier this month? \"I don\u2019t think I would have changed it at all,\" he says. \n \nThe eggs arrive, swimming in gravy, mushrooms and, I should have guessed, bacon. Our waitress smiles proudly. \n \nThe emerging history of the referendum is that David Cameron could easily have won, with luck and a better campaign. For Hannan, that presents an opportunity. \"An awful lot of people were quite close to that middle point, and it was quite a marginal decision which way they went. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true there\u2019s this unbridgeable gap or schism. It is possible to construct a relationship with the rest of the EU that will satisfy the vast majority.\" \n \nHis confidence is piercing. Has he never doubted his ideas? \"I always had a bottom line. Had the PM come back with a deal that set the precedent that we could bring powers back, I\u2019d have been happy with that.\" \n \nIt was easy for the Leave campaign to criticise Cameron, I suggest \u2014 you\u2019ve never had to hold power. Only a few Hannan ideas have been put to the test. One was a proposal for elected sheriffs \u2014 now in place as police and crime commissioners. Turnout at the last elections averaged 27 per cent, making it the only office to provoke more apathy than the European Parliament.\" \n \nYeaaah,\" says Hannan, cautiously. \"What is it Prospero says, \u2018This thing of darkness I acknowledge mine?\u2019 \" He blames \"the implementation\", including the \"terrible name\". \"Focus groups said sheriffs sounded too American. Which is the most depressing comment on our lack of interest in our history. I mean, where the hell do they think the Americans got the name from?\" \n \nIt is a rare flash of Hannan\u2019s humour. Soon he is serious again, defending his record. He was bearish on the euro, bullish on the British economy after the Brexit vote, and opposed to rescuing the banks in 2008. \"I would argue that what we are seeing throughout Europe and throughout the west \u2014 Trump, Bernie Sanders, Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders, Syriza, Podemos \u2014 are all delayed reactions to the bank bailouts, the delegitimisation of the market system,\" he says. \n \nI\u2019m not sure I follow, but by now I am more engaged trying to cut through the fat of the sweetbread. Hannan, in contrast, remains focused.\" \n \nI was reading a report by some German economists about how financial crises are different from a normal economic downturn. \u2026 They studied every financial crisis from 1870 in 20 different countries \u2014 France, US, Switzerland, you know \u2014 they said they always saw a massive bump in populist politics, on the left and on the right. There\u2019s always a move towards a fairly authoritarian mood, which doesn\u2019t happen in a normal recession.\" \n \nThe relatively good news is that it has an end. I would say we\u2019re seeing that end already, the glimmerings of it, in Greece. Greece began the cycle before anybody else, and Tsipras is now breaking records for unpopularity.\" \n \nHannan\u2019s chips and beans are untouched. The remains of his duck are large enough to fly away. \n \nHow will Trump\u2019s presidency unfold, I ask. \"The US, you could argue, was precisely designed to contain the ambitions of a Caligulan leader. The founders had someone very like him in mind.\" \n \nWell, the founders didn\u2019t have in mind that the US would be a nuclear-armed superpower. \"No. But other than their foreign policy, there are quite delineated powers. \u2026 Put it like this, if he were to behave unconstitutionally, or if he were to show utter unfitness in office, there is a majority for impeachment in both chambers. If there\u2019s one thing that will exert any restraint, it will be that.\" \n \nLater I ask how opponents of Trump and Le Pen might speed up their defeat.\" \n \nThe populists always fail in their own terms,\" Hannan begins. Aha, so Brexit \u2014 \"Let me be more specific, the protectionists always fail. They always end up delivering the sharpest fall in living standards to the people who are their biggest supporters.\" \n  \nI pop down the stairs to the loo. When I return Hannan is staring gleefully at a Twitter ruckus on his iPhone. He puts his phone to one side, revealing its Union Flag case. \n \nIn his book he calls for parliament to vote each year on how many migrants to allow into the UK. How many would he favour, I ask. \"I\u2019m in favour of a more liberal policy when it comes to high-skilled workers. I\u2019d also take students out of [the numbers].\" \n \nSo how many? \"There is going to be some reduction anyway, because the whole remittance value of zlotys from a British income is not what it was. \u2026 The only two changes I\u2019d make is a requirement that you had a job before you came. \u2026 And I would take complete control back on benefits: I\u2019d have a moratorium before you start paying.\" So you think parliament should vote on a number, but you don\u2019t have one in mind? \"It would vary year by year, but no.\" \n \nHe moves on to refugees, which he sees as being a huge issue for \"the next 50 years\". In 2015 he spent time at an Italian hostel for migrants who had arrived via Africa. \"Every country in the world has got to find some way of determining how to regulate an almost unlimited flow of people who will come in claiming refugee status. These are not people coming from Syria.\" \n \nDoes this mean pulling out of the 1951 refugee convention that commits the UK to allowing people to claim for asylum? He is open to persuasion on this but wonders if we shouldn\u2019t \"just be honest about the fact that it\u2019s arbitrary and say we will give the home secretary discretion over admitting 15,000 people a year or whatever. It\u2019s going to be terribly unfair to number 15,001 but every system will be unfair to somebody. This is at least one where it\u2019s rational.\" \n \nThe waitress offers pudding. Hannan wants mint tea, but I need sustenance. \n \nWe\u2019ve been here nearly two hours, and Hannan has dispatched his tie, undone two shirt buttons, pulled out his chair. Yet his manner remains formal. When I ask if there\u2019s another side to him \u2014 away from determined argument \u2014 he cites how he recently tested his \"strong conviction that lime is almost always superior to lemon in any sweet or savoury situation\". \n \n\"On Sunday afternoon I performed a controlled experiment \u2014 I got exactly the same [lemon drizzle] cake mix, and I did a blind tasting. \u2026 sure enough, lime won, three votes to one!\" Perhaps direct democracy will save us after all. \n \nBy now I am finding Hannan\u2019s obstinacy strangely provocative. How do we hold you accountable if Brexit doesn\u2019t work, I ask. \"I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019d define \u2018doesn\u2019t work\u2019.\" If £350m a week isn\u2019t available for public services? \"It is perfectly legitimate to cite the gross figure in politics. \u2026 That\u2019s the normal way. \u2026 \" Not really, I say, during the campaign you also said that Britain had created more jobs than the rest of the EU put together. That was a net figure including Germany (lots of jobs created) and Greece (lots of jobs lost). \"Overall people can look up the figures and decide whether they think it\u2019s fair.\" \n \nPerhaps the question is, for people claiming to restore trust in democracy, didn\u2019t the Leave campaign just damage it massively? \"Find me any referendum in the world where people haven\u2019t tried to fight tactically as well. \u2026 Both sides did that.\" \n \nDessert arrives \u2014 a mountain of Chantilly cream, a monument to the common agricultural policy. Using a long spoon, I confirm the absence of bacon. \n \nI turn to Hannan\u2019s future. He started in Brussels convinced that Tony Blair would try to take the UK into the euro. \"I was assuming things would come to a head much earlier than they actually did. \u2026 I wish I\u2019d done other things in retrospect.\" \n \nHis inclination now is to make up for lost time and he is considering leaving politics when his term expires in 2019. \"I could teach, I could write, I could go into business, I could go back to journalism,\" he suggests. In his early years as a MEP he wrote leaders for the Daily Telegraph, where he cut a tweedy figure and was known as a young fogey with adamantine right-wing views. \n \nWouldn\u2019t he miss it all? The Twitter spats with left-wingers? The media appearances? \"I really wouldn\u2019t!\" he protests, possibly too much. \"When you make a film, you need lots of different people with different skillsets \u2014 the producer, the director. \u2026 \" he reflects. \"I\u2019m happier as a scriptwriter than an actor.\" \n \nThe exhausting maelstrom of the referendum has exacted a price. \"There\u2019s a brilliant, brilliant Emily Dickinson poem about how common to be somebody. You know, I\u2019d like to be nobody, how common to be somebody.\" He pauses. \"I think of that \u2014 often.\" \n \nFor the moment Hannan is somebody, and a driver has pulled up outside to ferry him back to euroland. \"Do you need a lift?\" he asks. \"That\u2019s very kind,\" I say, but perhaps, like him, what I really need is a break. \n \n\u2022 The writer is an FT political correspondent \n \n© The Financial Times 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"European Union news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Belgium news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"UK business news","group":"Business"}],"title":"LUNCH WITH THE FT: Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan on what Britain should do next","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Business Live South Africa","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"229948990","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"name":"Business Live South Africa","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://businesslive.co.za","publisher":"BDFM"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204586619","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T00:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And is now expanding in California. \n \nBayonne, New Jersey. (PRWEB) January 29, 2017 \n \nQuartz Master is a quartz surfaces manufacturer, headquartered in Bayonne, New Jersey. The company produces the highest quality and largest quartz slabs in the industry. It distributes through many select locations in US and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. And is now expanding in California. \n \nThe demand for Quartz Master\u2019s Marble Collection prompted the company to open its first distribution center in California. In June 2016, Quartz Master opened its new 6500 square foot warehouse in Los Angeles to serve Los Angeles County. But within a couple of months, the distribution center was making deliveries to fabricators from as far south as San Diego to as far north as San Francisco. \n \nWhen it opened, the warehouse was stocked with a modest number of slabs, but within weeks it had to be restocked to meet demands. It now has millions in inventory. On January 2nd, they opened an office in San Diego, and on February 1st, an additional warehouse will open in San Francisco on Mariposa Avenue in Mountain View. \n \nQuartz Master is recognized for its Marble Collection. In 2011, after 12 months of laborious engineering, Quartz Master introduced the world\u2019s first marble design to Quartz. And in 2014, they perfected the art of book matching. Today, most all of their marble designs are book matched. Homeowners and interior designers appreciate the low maintenance, durability and unmatched stain resistance of quartz. And they love that they can design a kitchen that has the beauty of natural stone without the expense and hassle. \n \nTo meet demand and high-quality customer service, Quartz Master will have representatives throughout the state, who will supply showrooms, interior designers, and fabricators with samples and customer service. \n \nAbout Quartz Master \n\nQuartz Master is a world\u2019s experts of quartz surfaces.

It guides the reader to get to the root of blockages like excess poundage, release the cause of what was keeping her stuck, to get to that new job, new outfit, new healthy relationship or new health regime. Her book is readily available on Kindle, Amazon, CreateSpace and http://www.padaran.com for easy reading under the category of self-help, personal transformation, and self-help, motivational. Her book\u2019s official launch date is February 11, 2017. \n \nDaya was in a near death car accident and could no longer continue her work as a Yoga instructor or prepare her own food for the family. She had to rely on what the three males in the house could prepare for her, which were often fast foods. While no Yoga or exercise was possible for a very long time, she chose to exercise in her mind using tools she had learned previously in her study of yoga and fitness. This reinforced her understanding of the power of thought, particularly strong before, during and after sleeping, in transforming our reality. \n \nThere is an inherited gift of Creative Mind that is available to each of us. Our Maker is always in Total Agreement with whatever thoughts are held and entertained as truth. Consider these points from Daya's book. \n\n The power and knowledge to work with thoughts and utilize them to transform reality is always available. Consciousness is it! It creates the world from within to without, from mind to manifestation.  Ego uses guilt, anger, blame, judgment or criticism to create a self-reinforcing prison.  Changing perception changes reality.  Daya's words and inspirational story fire up the mental-emotional changes that can lead to a changed body image, enhanced relationships, goals achieved and transformation realized.  \nBookViral\u2019s Review \u2013 \"A faith-based and enlightened approach to overcoming life\u2019s challenges, Grow Thin While You Sleep proves a powerful catalyst for positive change. Highly accessible, Daya Devi-Doolin isn\u2019t an author to persuade her readers with undue complexity or make outlandish claims, but by candidly sharing her own experiences she invites her readers to take a step back and consider an alternative perspective. It\u2019s certainly compelling, and whilst you might find similar texts on the subject few authors inspire on the level that Daya Devi-Doolin does, or more importantly succeed in making the vital connection between spiritual and bodily well-being. In clear and concise prose her guidance is easy to visualize and follow. Through her own transformative experiences, both concept and execution are easy to incorporate in our daily regimes. She includes recipes to compliment her holistic methodology, but it\u2019s in the cleansing of body and mind that she opens us up to the possibilities of long-lasting and transformative change in our lives through influences we might otherwise not recognize or act upon.\" http://www.bookviral.com/grow-thin-while-you-sleep/4593174055 \n \nDaya-Devi Doolin\u2019s book \u201cGrow Thin While You Sleep!\u201d has answers that lead to where success lies. This book charts a course through a series of steps, a process that leads from perceived failure to sustained triumph. Daya interweaves her fascinating story within the principles that lead to achievement, even while you sleep. \n \nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb140221","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Top News US Full Feed"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Author\u2019s Helpful Journey on the Path to Transformation","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"SSUChronicle.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"606907479","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"14"},"name":"SSUChronicle.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ssuchronicle.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.padaran.com/","http://www.bookviral.com/grow-thin-while-you-sleep/4593174055","http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb14022109.htm","http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/01/prweb140221"],"sequenceId":"695204591233","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t learn a little, especially from people who have occupied the same seat that he took over this week. \n   \nFrom predecessor Nikki Haley, sworn in this week as America\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, McMaster can learn the lesson of being seen when it matters. Haley might want people to remember her for being a governor of job creation, but that was an obvious priority at the tail end of a recession. It might be better for McMaster to look at how Haley dealt with various crises \u2013 a hurricane, floods shootings \u2013 during her six-year tenure and realize that part of effective leadership is taking charge in a crisis and being seen a lot by people to illustrate things are under control. \n   \nFrom her predecessor, Mark Sanford, McMaster might learn more of what not to do as governor. Sanford had a \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d attitude in dealing with the legislature, which often pitted him against lawmakers of his own party. The takeaway from this relationship for McMaster should be to listen more. \n   \nFormer Gov. Jim Hodges used innovative thinking and political muscle to get approval of his big-ticket agenda item: an education lottery. It has wildly exceeded expectations, opening the doors of college to tens of thousands of South Carolinians like never before. From Hodges, McMaster can learn to think outside the box. \n   \nThe four-year term of Gov. David Beasley offers the lesson of courage for McMaster. As governor, Beasley, a Republican, sought to remove the Confederate flag from the top of the Statehouse dome. He also opposed unregulated video poker, incurring the political wrath of the gambling lobby, which poured millions into Hodges\u2019 campaign. While Beasley lost his 1998 re-election bid, the flag eventually came down and video poker went away. Beasley later won the coveted John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for standing up to institutional forces and doing the right thing. \n   \nThe leadership style of the late Gov. Carroll Campbell, a Republican who led the state for eight years with a Democratic legislature, offers lessons for McMaster. Many people might remember Campbell for his focus on getting government to work more like a business or for pushing restructuring after Operation Lost Trust cracked the old way of doing business at the Statehouse. But as former Campbell top staffer Bob McAlister recalled this week, \u201cIn these times of incredible political turmoil where people are spitting vitriol and acid out of their mouths, the modern interpretation of Carroll Campbell is how to get things done with people with whom you don\u2019t agree philosophically.\u201d (This is a lesson that might have served Sanford and Haley, too, in their dealings with state lawmakers.) \n   \nDick Riley of Greenville will be remembered forever as South Carolina\u2019s education governor. Riley, who later served as U.S. secretary of education under President Bill Clinton, continuously pushed South Carolina to do more to educate its children during his two terms as governor. Even today through the Riley Institute at Furman University, Riley beats the drum of bettering education to improve opportunities for the state\u2019s residents. Recent governors haven\u2019t had strong education records. McMaster would be wise to pick up the drumsticks and push for full funding of K-12 education as well as more early kindergarten opportunities. \n   \nFinally there\u2019s former Gov. Fritz Hollings, challenged in 1986 for his U.S. Senate seat by a young McMaster in his first political bid. While Hollings prevailed, McMaster can look back to Hollings\u2019 days as governor (1959-63) and find inspiration related to innovation (technical education and economic development) and focusing on moving the state forward. \n   \nIn his first days of office, it\u2019s clear that McMaster already has his eyes on the election of 2018 for which he is the obvious frontrunner, thanks to the power of incumbency. For much of his life, he\u2019s wanted to be governor. Now he is. So now let\u2019s see what McMaster has and, hopefully, use it to make South Carolina\u2019s future even brighter.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andy Brack Statehouse Report"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"ANDY BRACK: McMaster can learn lessons from past governors","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Florence","zipCode":"29501","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Florence","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"SC Now","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169677639","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"SC Now","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.scnow.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204603396","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:55:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There must be positive comprehensive gold policy and I believe it is so important for economy that so many people are dependent on it,\" he said. \n\n\"Crores of rupees are traded in the market and so many consumers, so many are producers, and from the linkage it to financial sector is increasing.

How did the Government of India come into possession of gold? Most of the gold was confiscated from smugglers. So the smuggled gold, the confiscate gold came handy,\" Reddy said. \n\n\"Smugglers also helped us to get over the BoP crisis,\" he said in a lighter vein. \n\nHe maintained that gold is the ultimate currency in the world, though domestically possessing it is part of Indian culture and for women it acts like insurance.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Time to come out with comprehensive gold policy: Y V Reddy","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNPa"],"sequenceId":"695204617500","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:02:21Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

However, permission had been sought only for 3000-5000 people. \n\nFollowing the incident, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minster Akhilesh Yadav had constituted a one-man inquiry commission to probe the stampede. \n\nJustice (Retd) Chauhan had summoned nearly 42 officials, who were on duty the day the incident occurred to record their statements. \n\nThe commission had earlier this month visited Varanasi between January 3 to 6 to probe the stampede incident and completed its first round of inquiry with recording statements of over 100 people, including eyewitnesses and organisers. \n\nHowever, Chauhan while talking to mediapersons here has said that so far only one official from Chandauli district had appeared before the commission to record his statement and no other officials turned up before the commission to record their statements. \n\nHe said that due to being engaged in the Assembly election duties, most of the officials had requested to extend the dates forappearing before the commission (to record their statements), to which the commission had given them one more chance and it will be returning again to Varanasi for holding its third round of inquiry. \n\nChauhan said the commission may extend its date of probe for nearly six more months and it is likely to return again on February 20, for its third round of inquiry. \n\nHe made an appeal to the people including mediapersons that if they had any video footages or photographs taken at the time of the incident, then they may provide it to the commission.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Varanasi stampede: Commission begins second round of inquiry","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNPj"],"sequenceId":"695204622378","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:12Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In his complaint Vaidya, a resident of Thane had filed the case against the Ministry of External Affairs through the Thane Passport Superintendent for \"sufferings\" caused during the Bangkok tour, which he could not complete due to the alleged goof up of the passport office. \n\nVaidya contended that he was issued a passport for a period starting from January 13, 1998 till January 12, 2018. When he along with his family undertook a trip to Bangkok on October 22, 2007 during the immigration check it was noticed that there was an overwriting on the passport in the expiry date section. The date printed was 2008 and over it was written as 2018. \n\nThe figure '1' was manually written in place of '0' in the passport. The immigration officials sought an explanation from Vaidya and only after they got it in writing from him that he had not written the same, allowed him to undertake the trip, says the complaint filed by Vaidya. \n\nHowever, at the Bangkok airport immigration officials verified online details of the passport and it was revealed that the expiry date was 2008 and not 2018. \n\n\"The passport office rectified the expiry date by manually changing it from 2008 to 2018, but failed to make the necessary changes in their system,\" pointed out Vaidya's complaint. \n\nUpon this they did not allow him to enter the country and deported him to India.\n\nThe complainant later sent a legal notice to the Passport \n\nOffice and when it was not answered filed the case. \n\nThe defendants contested the claim on the ground that the complaint was time barred as it was to be filed within two years from the date of the cause of action that is October 24, 2009 but was instead filed on December 3, 2009. \n\nThey further argued that the complainant did not fall under the definition of 'Consumer' under the Consumer Protection Act. \n\nThe complainant argued that he had filed the complaint for deficiency in services by the passport office due to overwriting and sufferings he had to undergo during the trip. \n\nThe forum noted that the complaint involves several issues like proof of the claims, allegations and documentary evidence which will be possible only after recording of evidences. \n\nIt cannot be decided summarily and is being disposed of without any decision, observed the members.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"Thailand news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Thane man gets no relief in passport goof up case","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNPi"],"sequenceId":"695204622640","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:12:11Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\"Mr. President, look at us,\" said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \"This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American.\" \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \"We are all immigrants!\" and \"No ban! No wall!\" \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \"What's happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\" \n Airport arrests  \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \"President Trump's new Muslim ban.\" \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n \n\"This executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\" he said in a statement. \n \nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \"Portland coffee comes from Yemen,\" one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n \nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \"hashtag activist\" but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n \n\"This was the last straw,\" she said of Trump's policies. \"We're all immigrants.\" \n \nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n \nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests against Trump's 'Muslim ban' continue","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Duval","zipCode":"32207","state":"Florida","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jacksonville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News4Jax.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658107","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"250"},"name":"News4Jax.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news4jax.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204623425","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It all looks great for the future, it's fantastic.\"\n\nHe received his knighthood in July the same year, and said of the honour: \"It does make one inordinately proud.\" Notorious for his wild lifestyle, he was reportedly fond of saying his career track record \"isn't bad for an old drunk\".\n\nBut in 2008 he said he'd been without drink for several years, and noted: \"Times change. You change.\n\n\"When it no longer seemed to help, creatively, I mean, as it unquestionably had helped at one stage, it seemed time to give it up.\n\n\"Besides, attitudes to drinking have changed. Would Churchill have been able to get away with his drinking if he had been a politician today?\"\n\nHe married his fourth wife, film producer Anwen, 51, in 2005,and described the pair as being \"wonderfully married\".\n\nBut previously, he was notorious for his tumultuous love life.\n\nDuring his career, Sir John picked up two Academy Award nominations - for The Elephant Man and Midnight Express.\n\nHe won four Baftas for films including An Englishman in New York and The Naked Civil Servant.\n\nHe once described how his friend Sir Laurence Olivier, passed on advice to him, describing: \"I remember Olivier, when I was playing the Fool in his King Lear, saying: 'When it comes to the obituary, they'll only ever mention three things, probably two, but if you're lucky three.'\n\n\"And of course when he died, they mentioned Richard III, Henry IV and either Marathon Man or Wuthering Heights.\n\n\"I mean, if you write your own obituary, I don't know, they'd take the things that got awards wouldn't they? So it would be Midnight Express, it would be Elephant Man and Naked Civil Servant probably.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in...","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"England news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Bristol pays tribute to screen legend John Hurt","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Bristol","zipCode":"BS2","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Bristol, City of","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bristol Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"366511629","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"37"},"name":"Bristol Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://bristolpost.co.uk","publisher":"Local World"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/hashtag/JohnHurt?src=hash","https://t.co/lZwiKSPToZ","https://twitter.com/BristolOldVic/status/825270764429533184","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?in_reply_to=825174529534160896"],"sequenceId":"695204639643","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:40:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/images/localworld/ugc-images/276268/Article/images/30093492/15825077.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The document covers the technical issues involved in a meet and confer, with an emphasis on being prepared with a solid IG framework and numerous considerations around proportionality. \n \n\u201cThis guide represents years of hard-won practical experience and contains advice around implementing the latest changes to the FRCP,\u201d explains LTPI Board Member Quin Gregor. \u201cIn developing this, while we found a few frameworks, these were either too high level or too in the weeds. None of these laid our vision of how we thought the process should be addressed. With our focus on legal technology and its application our advice is naturally more on the practical than legal. However, we have represented the legal framework as much as we need to within the LTPI purview. We've all witnessed too many drive-by Meet & Confers when one sides ignorance of the process led to shoddy client representation. With this guide, there is no longer any excuse.\u201d \n \nThe guide is broken into 4 stages: pre-conference, activities at the conference, post conference, and \u201ccommon pitfalls\u201d, providing practical guidance and checklist items and related strategic considerations to streamline the process and avoid any missed steps. It is a valuable resource to both the novice and the expert. \n \nThe project team members include Bob Rohlf (Exterro), Peter Pepiton (Dinsmore), Chris Paskach (The Claro Group), P. Sean d\u2019Albertis (Faegre), Kevin Clark (Thompson & Knight), Martin Tully (Akerman), Seth Eichenholtz (Mastercard), Quin Gregor (SigINT), Sunil Ohri (Stein Mitchell), and Noah Lauricella (Goldenberg Law). \n \nLTPI with industry partner ACEDS will host a webinar to discuss the guide and share best practices regarding the technical issues involved in a meet and confer. The webinar entitled \u201cMastering a Meaningful Meet-and-Confer\u201d will take place on February 23, 2017 at 1:00 PM EDT. More information about the webinar including how to register can be here . \n \nThe guide is currently open for public comment for the next 30 days by the legal community before being finalized and released. \n\nTo learn more about the Meet and Confer Guide, visit https://www.legaltechpi.org/Meet-and-Confer . \n \nLTPI is open to suggestions for new projects and accepting new project members.

The iHeart80s Party rocked the SAP Center in San Jose, California with a star-studded lineup of artists including New Kids on the Block , UB40 Featuring Ali Campbell, Astro and Mickey, Colin Hay of   Men At Work , Rick Astley , Starship ,  Eddie Money , and Night Ranger .

Tanner herself. \n   New Kids On The Block Brought All The Right Stuff  \nNew Kids On The Block are one of the O.G. boybands, and after over 30 years of performing together, the guys still have  the right stuff . NKOTB took the stage to perform hits like \u201cStep By Step,\u201d \u201cYou Got It (The Right Stuff),\u201d and more, and brought all of their amazing dance moves with them. And yes, we\u2019re talking about those classic steps you learned from watching their music videos. \n Also, the NKOTB fans were out in FULL FORCE. Donnie couldn\u2019t resist\u2026  Starship Reminds Us \u201cWe are all citizens of the world.\u201d  \nAt the very end of their performance at the 2017 iHeart80s Party, which also happened to be the day as President Donald Trump\u2019s Immigration Ban which sparked protests across the country, Starship lead singer Mickey Thomas simply told the crowd, \u201cRemember, we are all citizens of the world.\u201d \n  \n. @starshipcontrol is giving us life right now! \"Remember we are all citizens of the WORLD!\" #iheart80s  pic.twitter.com/y0MS7c5uPK \n\u2014 iHeartRadio (@iHeartRadio) January 29, 2017  Rick Astley Opened His Set With A Classic Rickroll  \nAstley kicked off his set with a classic Rickroll by leading fans to believe he was going to open with \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up\u201d by having his band play the instrumentals, but instead he kicked things off with his Whenever You Need Somebody single \u201cTogether Forever.\u201d Also during his set, the \u201880s icon, who turns 50 on February 6th, made jokes about his age and blamed it for his lack of dance numbers and inability to play high-energy songs back-to-back. \n UB40\u2019s \u201cRed Red Wine\u201d Had Everybody Feeling So Fine  \nUB40  Featuring Ali Campbell, Astro and Mickey  took us all back to 1983 with their hit \u201cRed Red Wine.\u201d The crowd went wild during the band\u2019s performance of the beloved tune -- everybody was feeling it. \n  \nRed red wine has everybody feeling so fine #iheart80s  pic.twitter.com/Zf5PhZcv0A \n\u2014 iHeartRadio (@iHeartRadio) January 29, 2017  Not to mention the band themselves\u2026   \nTime to sway.   @WeAreUB40 takes the stage now at our #iHeart80sParty in San Jose!

I'm sure the league, as they do every year, will try to figure out how they can make it better for everyone,\" Collins said. \n \n\"But you never know where we or any other club will end up.

I wondered first of all would he be solid enough mentally to cope with that. \n\n\"Then secondly you hope he will go well after he comes back after the second surgery. \n\n\"He worked very hard, he went through some moments of very deep disappointment. Because when he had the setback and he had to go in again, as a professional player that's very difficult. \n\nTheo Walcott celebrates scoring against his former club \n\n\"But he became even more resilient and worked even harder. He's highly respected inside the club because he's shown so much dedication. \n\n\"It was good to see Welbeck be so convincing. I didn't expect him at that level, because I knew he worked very hard but I didn't know how much efficiency it would be in a competitive game. \n\n\"It was great to see he hasn't lost his runs or his finishing; it shows as well when you are able to transform that frustration in not playing into efficiency that he's a special guy. \n\nWelbeck celebrates with Kieran Gibbs after scoring against Southampton \n\n\"There are always two fears, the first is that it takes him too long with decision-making, and second that he would be scared for contact. \n\n\"But the runs and also fighting the defenders, it was important for me.\" \n\nWelbeck opened the scoring with a dinked finish before latching onto Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's lofted pass to slide home between Harry Lewis' legs. \n\nThe former Manchester United striker then laid on Walcott's first goal, before second-half replacement Alexis Sanchez set up the final two finishes. \n\nWenger hailed Walcott for staying calm to score his treble and kill off any chances of a Saints fightback. \n\n\"Theo is a good finisher,\" said Wenger. \"And the chances we created were very good.

Lowry suggested Kibler has found a way to rehabilitate himself and become a productive member of society once again.\n\nAs part of the plea agreement, Chief Assistant County Prosecutor John Gamble said he had agreed not to make any recommendations for sentencing in the case.

Rusk and his brother, David Rusk\u2014will be held at 1 p.m. Monday in the East Texas Research Center, located on the second floor of the Steen Library on the SFA campus. \n \nSFA\u2019s Board of Regents approved the purchase of the collection, which contains about 1,000 items, from members of the Rusk family. The family generously donated approximately 600 additional items, and ETRC staff members have been diligently working since then to prepare the materials for public presentation. \n \n\u201cI have finished organizing the purchased materials,\u201d said Kyle Ainsworth, ETRC special collections librarian. \u201cNow, I\u2019m organizing and describing the donated materials so that I can integrate them with the purchased items and create one collection.\u201d \n \nThe collection contains Republic of Texas historical materials that have been in the Rusk family since the 1830s and includes several legal and personal documents of Thomas J. Rusk, a political and military leader of the Republic of Texas who served as its first secretary of war and as a general in the Battle of San Jacinto. He was later a U.S. politician and served as a senator from Texas. \n \nComprising the majority of the collection are documents addressed to David Rusk, Thomas\u2019 brother, who served as a Nacogdoches County sheriff and tax collector during the Republic period. Additional documents in the collection include letters addressed to David\u2019s son, John, as well as other family members. \n \nThere also are important county records, including delinquent tax rolls from the 1830s, several of David\u2019s civil and criminal sheriff\u2019s docket books, and receipts for the construction of the county\u2019s courthouse. \n \nAccording to Ainsworth, the materials help tell the story of Nacogdoches as well as the Republic of Texas and are an intimate picture of the Rusk family\u2019s private lives and public service. \n \n\u201cThe highlights of the collection are the 60 letters received by David Rusk from his older brother, several rare maps and appointments signed by various presidents of the Republic of Texas naming David Rusk sheriff of Nacogdoches County,\u201d Ainsworth said. \u201cOne of the appointments signed by Sam Houston in 1837 is exceptional because David Rusk was the first sheriff Houston appointed in Texas.\u201d  \n  \nIn one letter penned by Thomas in 1835, he lets David know  that a mail route to Nacogdoches has just been established via Fort Jessup in Louisiana. In another letter, Thomas tells David that he has just arrived at the Capitol, sat in his senate seat and will shortly meet with President James K. Polk.  \n  \nFour letters addressed to David from various veterans of the Battle of San Jacinto ask him to provide details on how they may obtain a Texas Revolution Service Pension. \n \n\u201cThe cursive writing from the 19th century can be difficult to read,\u201d Ainsworth said. \u201cDuring the reception, we will display mostly documents where the noteworthy feature is an important signature that everyone can recognize and appreciate as having value, including signatures from Presidents of the Republic of Texas Sam Houston, Mirabeau Lamar and Anson Jones.\u201d The ETRC will exhibit these noteworthy items outside of their offices. \n \nThe opening reception coincides with SFA\u2019s Board of Regents winter board meeting. There will be several speakers, including SFA President Baker Pattillo. \n \nThe reception is free and open to the public. Refreshments will be served. \n \nThe Rusk collection will be housed inside the ETRC and available for research beginning Feb. 1 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays. The exhibit of noteworthy documents is located outside the ETRC and viewable during library hours, 7 a.m. to midnight Monday through Thursday; 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday; 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday; and noon to midnight Sunday. ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Reception planned to open Rusk Family Letters","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Nacogdoches","zipCode":"75962","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Nacogdoches","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Stephen F.

The last try gave one precise combination of three drugs predicting partial melanocyte conversion. \n \n\"Our system predicted a three-component treatment, which we had never have come up with on our own, that achieved the exact outcome we wanted, and which we had not seen before in years of diverse experiments,\" Levin added. \n \n\"Such approaches are a key step for regenerative medicine, where a major obstacle is the fact that it is usually very hard to know how to manipulate the complex networks discovered by bioinformatics and wet lab experiments in such a way as to reach a desired therapeutic outcome,\" Levin noted. \n \nHe said that the team now wanted to do something different -- cure a disease, control cell behaviour and regenerate tissue. \n ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Cancer news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Medical news","group":"Science"}],"title":"AI helps scientists gain insight into cancer biophysics","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"The Statesman","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169674221","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"16"},"name":"The Statesman","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Science"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thestatesman.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204656861","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:03Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(Salem News photo by Katie White)\n\nWINONA \u2014 A water supply cooperative in Winona is trying to figure out how to satisfy the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) without going bankrupt.\n\nIn addition to facing a potential $25,000 a day fine for not having a water operator, the Winona Water Supply Cooperative Board is looking at how to fix a low pressure violation.\n\nFixing the pressure problem can be done in a variety of ways, but all at a price tag the cooperative board said it just can\u2019t handle.\n\nThe water system was not in violation of any water quality standards, Board Trustee Alan Gamble said.\n\nThe system has supplied water in the small community in Butler Township for several years through a shallow hand-laid brick well that is at least 120 years old. The well pumps to a 10,000-gallon cistern located at the top of a hill.\n\nDue to being privately-run, the company has limited to no access to any public county, state or federal funding to help. By law, public funding cannot be used for private projects.\n\nThe OEPA has recommended the board contact the Rural Community Assistance Program (RCAP) for funding assistance options.\n\nThe board held a public meeting with residents this week to communicate the problem, and Gamble resigned as trustee at the end of the meeting, ending his roughly 20 years of service.\n\nGamble said he made the decision prior to the meeting and is leaving for the same reason David Hull, the company\u2019s water operator of record recently left.\n\nGamble said they fear being held personally liable for the problems, like the former operator, Jim Bates.\n\nBates was serving as operator for Winona while also working as Water Superintendent for Sebring, prior to being fired from Sebring last year following OEPA action.\n\nTrustees said rough estimates to make the repairs to the pressure are anywhere from $200,000 to $300,000 \u2013 a high price for the cooperative that averages $500 to $600 in its account at billing time each month.\n\n\u201cThey (OEPA) know we can\u2019t do it tomorrow,\u201d \n\nRetired water board trustee Homer Althouse said he has been in contact with county engineer and sanitary engineer Bert Dawson.\n\nDawson told the Journal prior to the meeting that while the county has no responsibility to fix the problem, he has been speaking with residents who reached out to him with their concerns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve offered to help them, and I\u2019m sure everyone else would too,\u201d \n\nHis suggestions include having the homes with low pressure directly hook into the line that goes uphill from the well to the cistern, which he believes might result in enough pressure to satisfy the OEPA requirements, or installing a larger above-ground water storage tank, which would also increase water pressure since the lines are gravity fed from the cistern.\n\nHowever, Gamble is not sure the cooperative can finance those options.\n\nThe board has reached out to state Rep. Tim Ginter for help, and Ginter said he has also spoken with Dawson and the OEPA about the matter.\n\nThe board was displeased that no one from the OEPA attended the meeting, as they requested.\n\nAlan Gamble\u2019s brother John Gamble Jr., who is the county\u2019s chief assistant prosecuting attorney, was at the meeting and said that while there is a chance the company could walk away and the residents be taken over by another company or public water system, tapping into another system would be expensive.\n\nFor example, if they would become part of the Buckeye Water District, their monthly bill could be as high as $70, he said.\n\nThe city of Salem is another possible public water source, he added, but cautioned against those options due to the increased cost to customers.\n\nWith Alan Gamble out of the picture now as water trustee, the two remaining trustees and Althouse, who volunteered to replace Gamble on the board beginning that evening, will be considering the options and updating residents.\n\nAlan Gamble later said he would continue to help the board and the community as he could.\n\nCOLUMBIANA\u2014The death of a 38-year-old woman struck by a train here Saturday morning is under investigation by the ...\n\nWINONA \u2014 Trustees of the privately run cooperative that supplies water to Winona residents could face a $25,000 ...\n\nLISBON \u2014 The Columbiana County Park District is working with the Western Reserve Land Conservancy to acquire 30 ...\n\nPERRY TOWNSHIP\u2014Calls for domestic violence disputes, property damage, drunken driving arrests, unwanted subjects, ...\n\nToday's breaking news and more in your inbox\n\nCopyright © Salem News | http://www.salemnews.net | 161 North Lincoln, Salem, OH 4446","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Bankruptcy news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Winona water cooperative faces bankruptcy following EPA fines","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Columbiana","zipCode":"44460","state":"Ohio","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Salem","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Salem News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"334696661","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Salem News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://salemnews.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204659498","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.salemnews.net/images/2017/01/28230030/FullSizeRender2.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

(HERALD PHOTO/Bethany Lange)       EVANSTON \u2014 School districts around Wyoming are bracing for impact after the introduction of HB 236 on Wednesday. \nHB 236, also known as the education omnibus bill, attempts to deal with education funding shortfalls. \n\nIf the bill is passed, Evanston\u2019s school district will see an additional 2.13 percent budget cut next year, or $872,500, on top of the anticipated budget cuts. \n\nAccording to the HB 236 Bill Summary Impact document, Evanston enrollment will decrease by 44 students in 2018, compared to 2017 projections. \n\nThe Subcommittee on Education Deficit Reduction Options issued a document Dec. 28, 2016, detailing the state\u2019s education budget crisis and some options to address it. That document, \u201cWyoming K-12 Education Funding Deficit White Paper,\u201d is available at http://tinyurl.com/gnjdums. \n\nWyoming expects an annual shortfall of $360-400 million at least through 2022. This is both caused and exacerbated by the state\u2019s mineral industry crisis. \n\n\u201cDue to the overwhelming dependence on the mineral industry to fund education in Wyoming, we now find ourselves in a budget phenomenon known as the \u2018double-whammy,\u2019\u201d the document states. \n\nIn short, the state is required to prioritize public education funding; the state needs mineral revenue to operate schools; and mineral revenues are declining. \n\nIn 2015 alone, 5,400 oil and gas employees were laid off; total numbers for 2016 are still pending. Wyoming also saw its first population drop since 1990 last year. \n\nSchools are already dealing with the 2016 \u201cpenny cut\u201d and enrollment drops (which means less money), and will have to cut even more this year as it is. \n\nThe Subcommittee on Education Deficit Reductions Options provided five options to deal with the education funding deficit, saying each option could fix up to $80 million of the problem. These options are as follows: \n\n\u2022 Adjust the funding formula for school districts and reduce appropriations from the School Foundation Program Account (including reducing total funding by .06 percent every year, changing the funding formula to \u201ccost-based\u201d levels, consolidating school districts, purchasing instead of leasing school buses, reducing administrative salaries, reducing student activity funding, cutting the instructional facilitator program and cutting professional development days from 10 to five) \n\n\u2022 Find savings to offset shortfalls (using the Legislative Stabilization Reserve Account, or LSRA, to balance the School Foundation Program Account, or SFPA) \n\n\u2022 Find existing revenue (increase taxes or increase mineral royalties to the SFPA) \n\n\u2022 Recalibrate spending policies (increase the balance of the Common School Permanent Land Fund Reserve Account or send more investment income to the SFPA) \n\n\u2022 Enhance revenue (increase mill levies for education, impose a tax on health and professional services and increase sales tax) \n\nThe omnibus bill reflects many of these suggestions. \n\nHB 236 proposes to raise the state sales tax from 4 percent to 4.5 percent as soon as the LSRA has less than $500 million and continues the funding cuts begun in 2016. \n\nFurthermore, personnel will see a sharp impact. Superintendents, assistant superintendents and business managers would see their salaries cut by 10 percent; the instructional facilitator program would be cut in half; and the school year would be cut from 185 to 180 days. \n\nBus purchases and leases and alternative school building would be frozen. \n\nCommittees would be created to study alternative schools and recalibrate funding to a cost-based funding model, including for transportation and special education. \n\nAlso, the LSRA would maintain the SFPA at $100 million every year unless the LSRA has less than $500 million in the account. \n\nThe Uinta County School District No. 1 heard about the omnibus bill at Tuesday\u2019s school board meeting. \n\nSuperintendent Ryan Thomas said he is keeping in touch with Rep. Garry Piiparinen about it. The omnibus bill is only one of many education-related bills; others propose to increase class sizes, while the omnibus bill focuses on cutting school days instead of class sizes, which would in turn cut salaries \u2014 possibly by $1,800 per teacher. \n\nAssistant superintendent Doug Rigby termed it the \u2018ominous bill.\u2019 \n\nRep. Piiparinen, who is also a schoolteacher, told the Herald that he was the only member of the education committee who did not put his name on the bill. When the committee was asked to sponsor the bill, he had not had a chance to read the 53-page bill yet and did not want to put his name to it. \n\n\u201cIt would be hard for me to defend a lot of those things,\u201d he said. \n\nPiiparinen said the bill was run through quickly but that it seems to put the responsibility for the state\u2019s budget issues on education. He added that he would like to see other measures investigated as well, such as putting the Capitol Square Project on hold (including the Herschler building remodel and expansion) and working on the general fund. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just expecting education to solve this,\u201d he said. \u201c... It\u2019s a state problem; it\u2019s not just an education problem.\u201d \n\nThe Legislature is accepting public comments on the bill at http://tinyurl.com/zfo9y6e. It will come to a vote on Monday evening.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"School funding on chopping block statewide","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Uinta","zipCode":"82930","state":"Wyoming","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Evanston","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Uinta County Herald","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169696699","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Uinta County Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.uintacountyherald.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://tinyurl.com/gnjdums","http://tinyurl.com/zfo9y6e"],"sequenceId":"695204679835","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

To win, its craft must land on luna \u2014 and a probe must move at least 500 meters (1,640 feet) and send hi-resolution images of its exploration back to earth. \n \nThe winner gets the $20 million grand prize, while runners-up split a $1 million consolation award. \n \nIt\u2019s already taking a bit longer than hoped \u2014 rules that required a complete finish by the Dec. 31 deadline just got loosened to give the competitors a bit more time. \n \nBut the goal is still remarkable: landing a high-tech mobile probe on the moon, 238,900 miles away. The Chinese government, with all its vast resources and desire to win global respect, pulled it off in 2013 \u2014 but the last (non-crash) landing before that was in 1976. \n \nThe five teams include one international one, Synergy Moon, with members from 15-plus countries, as well as the Israeli SpaceIL, the California-based Moon Express, India\u2019s Team Indus and Japan\u2019s Hakuto. \n \nEach has its rocket booked (Team Indus and Hakuto are actually sharing their flight) and the contract verified by X Prize, which sponsors a variety of technical contests aimed at building a better future. \n \nEstablished in 2007, the competition is meant to push a lowering of the cost of spaceflight \u2014 while also inspiring the world\u2019s scientists and engineers. \n \nOnce this competition is won, it\u2019ll be time for a race to get live astronauts back to luna: It\u2019s been far too long (45 years!) since the late Gene Cernan walked on the moon. \n \nGovernment programs alone will never establish a real human presence off-planet: That will require a private sector that can make it pay. The Google Lunar XPRIZE promises a giant step toward that brilliant future. \n  Share this","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Post Editorial Board"},"topics":[{"name":"Space science news","group":"Science"}],"title":"The new space race: Private moon launches by Dec. 31","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"New York","zipCode":"10036","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"New York","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"New York Post","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658380","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"124827"},"name":"New York Post","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.nypost.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204685951","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:41Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/161229-space-sights-year-10.jpg?quality=90&strip=all"},{"url":"https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/161229-space-sights-year-10.jpg?quality=90&strip=all"}],"video":[]}}

By the time he died of cancer in October 2011, Apple was the most valuable corporation on Earth. His unique approach to business made the Apple brand stand out above its competition\u2014and above every organization in any field. He reached the height of success in the physical realm, but there is so much more to be gained from the human experience. \n \nJobs possessed the rare ability to focus like a laser on his objectives. \u201cI\u2019ve freed up some good engineers who could work on new mobile devices, and eventually got it right when we moved on to iPhones and the iPad,\u201d he said. \u201cThis ability to focus saved Apple.\u201d At the time, Apple was trying to produce an incalculable number of gadgets. Jobs pared that down to just four: one desktop and one portable device each for both the consumer and the professional. \n \nThe word focus can refer to adjusting the lens of a camera to fixate sharply on one object. We can develop this ability figuratively. Focus is a foundational tool for success. Few possess it. Even fewer possess the ultimate success focus. \n \n[embedded content] \n It Takes Love  \nSteve Jobs was the greatest ceo ever, so it\u2019s no surprise that he gave the most-quoted commencement address of all time at Stanford University in 2005. Here is an excerpt: \n \nI was lucky\u2014I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents\u2019 garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years, Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees. We had just released our finest creation\u2014the Macintosh\u2014a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew, we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so, things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30, I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating. \n\nI really didn\u2019t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down\u2014that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me\u2014I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over. \n \nGod\u2019s own people failed to love His truth! Because of that, they lost their focus. They don\u2019t face trials and keep pushing forward like Steve Jobs did; they just give up because they don\u2019t love God anyway. Fifty percent of them will eventually repent, but the other half never will. It is impossible to focus on anything if it is not the absolute priority in that moment. Jobs continued: \n \nI didn\u2019t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. \n\nDuring the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world\u2019s first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple\u2019s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn\u2019t been fired from Apple. It was awful-tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don\u2019t lose faith. I\u2019m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You\u2019ve got to find what you love. \u2026 [T]he only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven\u2019t found it yet, keep looking. Don\u2019t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you\u2019ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don\u2019t settle. \n \nSteve Jobs focused so intensely on producing great products that many brilliant minds couldn\u2019t handle working for him. Only those who shared his passion for perfection could rise to the challenge. Time magazine quoted Jobs talking about the creation of the iPhone, which debuted in stores in 2007: \n \n[T]here always seems to come a moment where it\u2019s just not working, and it\u2019s so easy to fool yourself\u2014to convince yourself that it is when you know in your heart that it isn\u2019t. Well, you know what? It\u2019s been that way with [almost] every major project at Apple, too. \u2026 Take the iPhone. We had a different enclosure design for this iPhone until way too close to the introduction to ever change it. And I came in one Monday morning, I said, \u201cI just don\u2019t love this. I can\u2019t convince myself to fall in love with this. And this is the most important product we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d And we pushed the reset button. We went through all of the zillions of models we\u2019d made and ideas we\u2019d had. And we ended up creating what you see here as the iPhone, which is dramatically better. \u2026 [W]e had to go to the team and say, \u201cAll this work you\u2019ve [done] for the last year, we\u2019re going to have to throw it away and start over, and we\u2019re going to have to work twice as hard now because we don\u2019t have enough time.\u201d And you know what everybody said? \u201cSign us up.\u201d \n \nJobs scrapped the iPhone! By all accounts, it was a quality piece of technology, but it wasn\u2019t perfect. If Jobs couldn\u2019t fall in love with it, then no consumer ever would. So his team started over. History will show that Jobs made the right decision: Time named the iPhone the Invention of the Year. \n \nCombine focus with a deep love for the subject, and you can \u201cmake a dent in the universe,\u201d as Jobs often described his life\u2019s purpose. If your heart isn\u2019t in it, you will lose focus. \n Full of Light  \n\u201cThe light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness. Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness. If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light\u201d (Luke 11:34-36). Proper focus requires not only concentration on one clear goal, but also the right goal to pursue. There are a multitude of areas where we can direct our focus, but certain areas are far more important than others. Some areas are good, and others are evil. \n \n\u201cNo man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon\u201d (Matthew 6:24). You can\u2019t serve God and money! It must be one or the other. God is concerned about where and how we focus. \n \n\u201cServants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ\u201d (Ephesians 6:5). In all you do\u2014marriage, family, work, recreation\u2014God will give you success if you focus with \u201csingleness of your heart\u201d! \n \n\u201cFor where your treasure is, there will your heart be also\u201d (Matthew 6:21). This is the real key to developing the ultimate success focus. Is our main focus on material riches on this Earth? God wants to give us the universe! (Hebrews 1-2). It is so easy to confine our view to this physical Earth and forget about the incredible reward that God is offering. \n \n\u201cTherefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?\u201d (Matthew 6:25). Christ goes on to say that if He provides for the birds and the lilies, why wouldn\u2019t He give us so much more? (verses 26-32). He tells us to take no thought \u2014not to be worried so much about physical things. Real life goes far beyond this temporary existence. \n \n\u201cBut seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you\u201d (verse 33). Here it is! God\u2019s Kingdom should be your ultimate success focus ! Then you will experience the most joyful and successful life imaginable. ▪","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Gerald Flurry"},"topics":[{"name":"Apple news","group":"Companies"}],"title":"Steve Jobs: Focused Like a Laser","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Oklahoma","zipCode":"73034","state":"Oklahoma","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Edmond","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Philadelphia Trumpet","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169819373","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"56"},"name":"Philadelphia Trumpet","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thetrumpet.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204690940","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It's un-American' \n\nUpdated: Jan 29, 2017 03:20 AM EST \n\nG. Morty Ortega/ \n\nRelated content \n\n(CNN) - More protests against President Donald Trump's immigration policies are set for Sunday across the country after hundreds of demonstrators converged on airports the day before.. \n\nProtests are scheduled today in Washington, Orlando, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle, and Chicago, mostly at airports. \n\nThis is the second weekend of demonstrations, with more than 1 million people coming out last weekend for the Women's March. \n\nOlivia Katbi Smith told CNN affiliate KATU she showed up Saturday at Portland International Airport because she believes Trump's immigration policies are cruel. \n\n\"I think it's horrific and terrible and we are basically condemning people to death by not allowing them to come here,\" she said. \n\nShe said the event appeared to be impromptu. She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n\nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n\n\"Mr. President, look at us,\" said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \"This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American.\" \n\nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \"We are all immigrants!\" and \"No ban! No wall!\" \n\nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n\nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n\n\"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said. \n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \"What's happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\" \n\nAirport arrests \n\nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n\nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \"President Trump's new Muslim ban.\" \n\nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n\nThat move limited part of President Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n\n\"This executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\" he said in a statement. \n\nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \"Portland coffee comes from Yemen,\" one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n\nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \"hashtag activist\" but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n\n\"This was the last straw,\" she said of Trump's policies. \"We're all immigrants.\" \n\nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n\nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Protests against Trump's 'Muslim ban' continue","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bristol","zipCode":"24201","state":"Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bristol","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WCYB-TV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"173643002","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"39"},"name":"WCYB-TV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wcyb.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204691630","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

Qantas is offering refunds to any passengers travelling from Australia to the United States who are affected by a new entry ban. Dozens of travellers have been detained at US airports and protests have erupted around the country. The executive order signed by US President Donald Trump has barred citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days.

Friday's march has taken place annually since 1973, after the Supreme Court ruled the right to privacy extends to a woman's right to have an abortion. \n \nComing back to Mid-Missouri on one of five buses Saturday morning, the Rev. Greg Oligschlaeger, pilgrimage organizer and vocation director for the diocese, said those who went to the march were gathered in a spirit of joy and peaceful demonstration. \n \n\"We all got along,\" he said. \"There wasn't any hate. If we did run into protesters against what we were doing, we told them we would pray for them. It seems people are looking at this more as an issue about lives instead of strictly politics.\" \n \nJay Nies, editor of the Catholic Missourian , made the trip and said he saw young people motivated to offer women alternatives that had not been available in the past. \n \n\"You can't just outlaw something without helping mothers and families raising children,\" he said. \n \nBefore starting the trip back, Oligschlaeger said they asked the youth to say what the trip meant to them. \n \n\"A majority were really blown away and inspired by the men and women they met,\" he said. \"Some saw so many youth going to Mass and felt that may help them go to Mass more often. Many also said they didn't realize how many Christians believe in what they do, and that really was inspirational. \n \n\"I think the national media wanted to make it a women's issue, but I think the majority of those there believed it supported women but also the life of the child, recognizing life is a gift from God and we don't have right to take it,\" Oligschlaeger said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Area youth participate in March for Life","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cole","zipCode":"65101","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jefferson City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Jefferson City News Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"174477660","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"461"},"name":"Jefferson City News Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newstribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.diojeffcity.org/","http://www.diojeffcity.org/thecatholicmissourian/"],"sequenceId":"695204693456","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The hall will be open to the public until 2 p.m. and will feature \"life-affirming booths and vendors.\" There will also be light refreshments available for a nominal fee. \n \nMembers of the Knights of Columbus Precious Blood Council 4454 are planned to arrive at 9 a.m at Selinger, and at 9:30 a.m., the pre-march rally with speakers will begin. \n \nThis year's speakers are Ryan Bomberger and Dr. Vansen Wong. \n \nBomberger co-founded the Radiance Foundation with his wife, Bethany. \n \nHe describes himself as a broadcast media designer, producer, columnist and author. Beyond media production and appearances, the Radiance Foundation's website said Bomberger travels the country as a pro-life activist and fundraiser. \n \nWong is an OB-GYN from Roseville, California. He used to perform abortions as part of his practice in Sacramento but quit offering the procedure after seven years to become a pro-life advocate. \n \nHe is affiliated with the Kaiser Permanente Medical Group, is a medical director of the Alternatives Pregnancy Center in Sacramento, and has testified in favor of pro-life legislation in the California Legislature, according to the March for Life website. \n \nThe march to the Capitol is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. at St. Peter Church. It will proceed north \u2014 past the Governor's Mansion \u2014 to Madison Street, then onto High Street toward the Capitol. The route is approximately three-quarters of a mile. \n \nThe rally inside the Capitol Rotunda on the first floor is set to begin at 10:30 a.m. During the rally, the \"Patriot and Statesman for Life\" award will be presented by Team P.L.A.Y. \n \nLunch is scheduled to follow at noon at Selinger Hall. Chili and hot dogs will be prepared by the Knights of Columbus for a nominal fee to help cover event expenses. \n \nAt 2 p.m., a Mass for Life will be at St. Peter Church. Bishop John Gaydos of the Catholic Diocese of Jefferson City will be the principal celebrant. \n \nThe collection at the Mass will go toward covering expenses of the march. \n \nOther guests are listed as Mark Serafino; Bridget Van Means of ThriVe Express Women's Healthcare; Reagan Barklage of Students for Life of America; Steve Rupp, president of Missouri Right to Life; Zina Hackworth of This Race Will Self-Destruct; and Chuck and Linda Raymond of Silent No More. \n \nThe website lists the municipal garage at 200 Madison St. as a parking site for the march. \n \nMarchers are encouraged to wear red clothing to represent the pro-life movement. \n \nA flyer for the event states ThriVe Express Women's Healthcare will have a mobile medical unit available for \"ongoing tours.\" \n \nThriVe is based in the St. Louis area, and its branches offer services including pregnancy tests, limited obstetrical ultrasounds to confirm pregnancies (if a pregnancy test is positive and medical assessment criteria are met), verification for Medicaid and WIC applications, information on adoption, adoption agency referrals and resources, and community referrals to help parents solve practical and material needs, according to its website. \n \nFor more information, visit midwestmarchforlife.com or call Mike and Kathy Forck at 573-340-8444.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Local pro-life march is Saturday","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cole","zipCode":"65101","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jefferson City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Jefferson City News Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"174477660","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"461"},"name":"Jefferson City News Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newstribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://midwestmarchforlife.com/","http://www.theradiancefoundation.org/","http://www.alternativespc.org/","http://thrivestlouis.org/"],"sequenceId":"695204704926","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She was my biggest ally. She gave everything, she gave a tremendous, very complex performance,\" Villeneuve, 49, told AFP at the Producers Guild Awards (PGAs) in Beverly Hills. \n\nTaking its cue from classics such as \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" (1977) and \"Contact\" (1997), \"Arrival\" was filmed in Villeneuve's native Quebec for a relatively small $50 million. \n\nAdams, 42, was universally lauded for her portrayal of Louise Banks, a linguist enlisted by the army after alien pods pop up worldwide, to help figure out what their occupants want. \n\nThe picture pairs Adams with fellow \"American Hustle\" star Jeremy Renner, playing against type as a shy, soft-spoken mathematician. \n\nThe best actress Oscar nominations went to Emma Stone (\"La La Land\"), Natalie Portman (\"Jackie\"), Ruth Negga (\"Loving\"), Isabelle Huppert (\"Elle\") and Meryl Streep (\"Florence Foster Jenkins\"). \n\nVilleneuve told AFP he had spoken to Adams several times since the nominations and that she had been nothing but magnanimous. \n\n\"Amy Adams is the incarnation of grace,\" said the director, who made \"Sicario\" (2015) and has just finished filming the much-anticipated sequel to iconic sci-fi favorite \"Blade Runner.\" \n\n\"She just said to me, 'Danny -- it's all right. The movie is nominated, you are nominated, it's all good. Don't think about it, please just celebrate.'\" \n\n\"Arrival\" was competing for best film at the PGAs alongside \"Deadpool,\" \"Fences,\" \"Hacksaw Ridge,\" \"Hell or High Water,\" \"Hidden Figures,\" \"La La Land,\" \"Lion,\" \"Manchester by the Sea\" and \"Moonlight.\" \n\n\"Blade Runner 2049\" -- which comes out in October, some 35 years after the cult neo-noir original -- sees Harrison Ford reprising his role as Rick Deckard, this time opposite Ryan Gosling. \n\n\"It was like the most powerful and intense cinematic experience of my life. It's tough to talk about it -- I'm still in it -- but it was a very powerful experience,\" Villeneuve told AFP. \n\nDescribing his 74-year-old star as his \"childhood hero,\" he admitted to being in awe of Ford when filming began last summer in Budapest, Hungary. \n\n\"A good thing is that Harrison is a very humble, very funny, generous human being. He broke the ice,\" Villeneuve said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Villeneuve 'very disappointed' at Amy Adams Oscar snub","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Yahoo!

He wanted to please Latinos who identify with immigrants so much that they want to give the undocumented legal status, and also union members who are so afraid of competition that they would prefer to hand them a one-way ticket out of the country. \n \nUltimately, Obama took care of labor and settled for trying to fool Latinos into thinking he was in their corner. In reality, he was working against their interests by deporting a record number of people. \n \nIn his first term, Obama wasted a lot of time and energy arguing with supporters who wanted him to stop deportations \u2013 or at least slow them down \u2013 and denying that he had the executive authority to act without Congress. \n  \n \nContinue reading \n    \nIn his second term, he miraculously found that power and gave so-called Dreamers \u2013 undocumented young people brought here as children \u2013 a two-year reprieve from deportations. \n \nObama went from soliciting Latino votes in the 2008 election by promising to tackle immigration reform in his first 100 days to never getting around to crafting a remedy for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. \n \nAnd he went from criticizing the George W. Bush administration for sending federal agents to arrest nursing mothers who were \u201ctorn from their babies\u201d to essentially deputizing, through Secure Communities, thousands of local and state police officers to enforce federal immigration law by checking the immigration status of anyone with whom they came in contact. \n \nIn recent weeks, the same person who \u2013 in August 2010 \u2013 signed a $600 million border security bill proposed by Senate Democrats that put more agents, fencing and equipment on the U.S.-Mexico border expressed worry about his successor\u2019s plan to build a border wall. \n \nIt\u2019s surreal to hear Obama and other Democrats express their indignation at the idea that people could be deported and families separated when, for the past eight years, this has been standard operating procedure for the Obama administration and the party that covered up for it. \n \nThere needs to be an honest and serious accounting of Obama\u2019s cynical and cruel immigration record. \n \nAnd yet we can\u2019t very well expect the media to provide it. They\u2019re too busy scrutinizing the current president for threatening to do much of what the last one already did. \n \nAt the same time, we have pro-Obama spinners who are trying to wipe his record clean and convince us all that the bad stuff never happened. \n  \n \nContinue reading \n    \nIt happened, and it went like this. \n \nAfter winning election in 2008, Obama recruited as his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel who, while he was in Congress, worked hard to keep immigration reform off the agenda. And he named as his first homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano who, as Arizona governor, declared a state of emergency on the border. \n \nOnce in office, Obama broke his vow to make immigration reform a priority, deported about 3 million people, divided hundreds of thousands of families and put into foster care tens of thousands of U.S.-born children whose parents got deported. \n \nHe also pushed back initially against those immigration reformers who asked that he use executive power to halt deportations, claimed falsely that his administration was only deporting criminals and then tried to pin the whole debacle on Republicans. \n \nAnd when faced \u2013 in the summer of 2014 \u2013 with tens of thousands of women and child refugees from Central America streaming across the U.S.-Mexico border, Obama ordered most them deported without due process, jailed thousands of others, including infants and toddlers who were put in what activists have come to refer to as \u201cbaby jails,\u201d and released others into the custody of relatives in the United States \u2013 only to round them up two years later. \n \nWhile all this was happening, the liberal media seemed not all that interested and said very little. \n \nIt\u2019s no wonder they\u2019re so fired up now to go after President Trump on his immigration crackdown. After a siesta that lasted eight long years, they\u2019ve got to be well rested. \n \nCopyright, The Washington Post Writers Group.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US immigration news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Media suffers amnesia regarding Obama\u2019s record on immigration","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Bernalillo","zipCode":"87109","state":"New Mexico","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Albuquerque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Albuquerque Journal","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169660875","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3746"},"name":"Albuquerque Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.abqjournal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204708173","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Here are some of its key features as signaled by the words and actions of the administration in its first week in office: \n \nIt is targeting higher growth and greater job creation using what can be called an \"import- substitution-plus\" approach to policy making, together with elements of an industrial policy: \n \nIn a manner reminiscent of traditional import-substitution strategies, the Trump administration is seeking to attract to the U.S. production facilities that serve the domestic market from abroad. Also, and this is where the \"plus\" comes in, it is seeking to bring to America foreign-based production facilities that serve non-U.S. markets. To amplify the desired impact on jobs and wages, the administration is adding elements of industrial policy in its interactions with certain sectors (automobiles, for example). \n \nIt operates both at the micro and macro levels : \n \nThis focus highlights the mix of macro and micro interventions being pursued by the administration. The macro level is dominated by four strains: deregulation, tax reform, infrastructure and changing incentives to favor domestic production and the consumption of U.S.-made goods and services. The micro combines sectoral emphasis with the selective application of moral suasion to individual companies and even specific projects. \n \nIt actively uses signals and narratives as economic policy tools: \n \nConventional economists will tend to dismiss the overall impact of such micro measures, but others will note that the signaling effect could be consequential -- through their impact in altering narratives, expectations and behaviors at the more general level. This effect is turbocharged by the president's repeated emphasis on jobs and the active use of a range of communication tools, including more informal ones such as Twitter. \n \nIt is underpinned by a carrot and stick philosophy: \n \nThe message is amplified by an evolving implicit contract between the administration and the business sector that is underpinned by carrots and sticks -- notably the incentives of less onerous regulation and lower taxes and the threats of shaming and punishing businesses that aren't sufficiently responsive to the admonition to \"put America first.\" \n \nWhen it comes to cross-border relationships, the administration isn't shy about upending multidecade constants in U.S. economic policy making: \n \nThis approach seemingly also extends to a willingness to depart from long-established rules and practices governing cross-border relationships -- from talking down the dollar and withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership to threatening to dismantle the North America Free Trade Agreement and to impose tariffs that would be inconsistent with commitments under the World Trade Organization. In the process, and as part of a negotiating strategy with other countries, the administration is signaling its willingness to question and upend, if necessary, deeply engrained principles of international economic management. \n \nIt remains to be seen how all this will come together, especially as many policy intentions haven't made the tricky transition from announcement to detailed design and sustained implementation. Also, Congress will have a say in this process. Despite that, some economists are already comparing the evolving U.S. economic policy approach to those that were pursued in Latin America by populist governments. Veterans of development economics, in particular, are being reminded of the import-substitution growth models that were pursued, on more than one occasion, by such countries as Argentina and Brazil. \n \nBut that comparison could be premature, and perhaps even misleading; and not just because of the very different initial economic and financial conditions prevailing in the U.S. \n \nIf sustained, the impact of Trump's approach would extend well beyond changes to the internal workings and orientations of the U.S. economy, including how it picks and chooses the way it interacts with the global economy . Given that the U.S. is at the core of the international monetary system, what happens here would not stay here. It would most likely trigger reactions from other countries while potentially also shaking the conventional functioning of a rule-based global system. \n \nIf this is managed in a collaborative manner that balances countries' domestic and global responsibilities, the result could be the type of generalized policy revamp that is critical for sustaining high and more inclusive growth and for delivering genuine financial stability. But if it is done in an internationally disjointed and uncoordinated fashion, the result would tend toward greater global economic fragmentation. This would reduce both current and future growth and prosperity while increasing the risk of unsettling financial instability down the road. \n \nThis post  originally appeared  on Bloomberg View.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Mohamed El-Erian"},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Trump's Economic Approach Starts To Take Shape","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Seeking Alpha","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663873","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1282"},"name":"Seeking Alpha","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.seekingalpha.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-01-23/trump-said-to-meet-with-dow-ceo-liveris-labor-leaders-on-monday","http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-01-23/trump-said-to-sign-executive-order-on-trans-pacific-pact-monday","http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-24/trump-protectionism-might-help-emerging-markets-hedge-fund-says","http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-01-26/trump-s-economic-approach-starts-to-take-shape"],"sequenceId":"695204709270","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:22:10Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

J. Bret Johnson grew up on a farm near Unionville in rural Putnam County, worked for the sheriff's department for a couple years after high school \u2014 and joined the Patrol in August 1986. \n \nHe's retiring Wednesday from the superintendent's post \u2014 a job with statewide responsibilities. \n \nThe Patrol requires its members to retire at age 60 \u2014 but Johnson is just 58, so his retirement this week isn't required. \n \n\"If you are going to work (after) the Highway Patrol, I think you have to figure out where you're more marketable,\" he explained in an interview last week. \"You have to make the decision of when's the right time to go.\" \n \nJohnson said he considered retiring a couple years ago while still serving as the Field Operations Bureau's director but stayed when then-Gov. Jay Nixon asked him to succeed Col. Ron Replogle as superintendent in May 2015. \n \nNineteen months later, he coordinated with the incoming Eric Greitens administration to set Feb. 1 as his retirement date. \n \n\"I'm proud of the things that we have accomplished, so I'm glad I stayed,\" he told the News Tribune. \n \nWhile Johnson doesn't know who his successor will be, he has worked with those on his command staff to prepare them for the possibility of being the next superintendent. \n \nCommand staff meetings involving himself, the lieutenant colonel and six majors often involved disagreements on how the Patrol should address issues. \n \n\"We had open discussion (over) long hours,\" Johnson said. \"When we opened these doors and walked out, I felt everyone was on the same page.\" \n \nJohnson was assigned to General Headquarters staff duties in August 2001 and has been part of the command staff since 2007. \n \nThe Patrol faced some major issues during Johnson's work as superintendent and Field Operations director \u2014 including the state's response after the May 2011 Joplin tornado killed more than 160 people, after Michael Brown was killed by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, after Brandon Ellingson's May 2014 drowning at the Lake of the Ozarks while in Patrol custody, and the 2010 merger of the highway and water patrols. \n \nHowever, Johnson said, those well-publicized situations didn't change the Patrol, overall. \n \n\"I think, when you live in Jefferson City, those are a lot bigger issues than they are if you're a trooper doing our primary function and living in Kahoka, Hayti, Tarkio\" or elsewhere in the state, he explained. \"I think those issues were more significant for the people who sit around this (command staff) table\" in the superintendent's office. \n \nThe first job inside the Patrol is trooper \u2014 providing basic law enforcement on the state's highways and waterways. \n \nAnd that work begins only after an extensive, six-month training program at the Academy on the hill behind the General Headquarters in Jefferson City. \n \nBefore the new troopers begin working solo, they get in-the-field experience and more training from veterans. \n \n\"Early in your career, I don't think you could ever see yourself being the superintendent,\" Johnson said. \n \nA trooper who wants to become an administrator must first go through the assessment center, which is offered only every two years, he explained. \n \n\"Last year, only 22 percent of our sergeants who took the assessment center even passed it to become eligible to be promoted to lieutenant,\" Johnson said. \"That is the biggest change in our organization, when it comes to rank.\" \n \nWhen Johnson made the switch in 1999, he recalled, the Highway Patrol wasn't using technology in the ways they are now \u2014 and technology has made a major difference in the way the Patrol operates, making it easier to communicate with each other and with other law agencies in other states. \n \n\"We still didn't have email when I came to (Jefferson City-based) Troop F,\" he remembered. \"We had pagers, and the duty lieutenant had a bag-phone for a cellphone. \n \n\"We had no computers in the cars, and we had a computer in the office (where) the reports would come in a hard copy. And the clerical staff would re-type all the reports.\" \n \nThe 2010 Water Patrol merger into the Highway Patrol combined differing law enforcement cultures. \n \n\"Any merger is like a marriage \u2014 it takes time to adjust to each other,\" Johnson noted. \"I certainly had feelings for the administration and those in the Water Patrol who were actually 'losing' their agency \u2014 and we tried to be conscious of that.\" \n \nThe merger was an effort to save the state some money, avoid a cut of 18-20 Water Patrol veterans, and \"gain some efficiencies\" \u2014 and those have happened, Johnson said, although he admitted it's hard to see those efficiencies from the outside. \n \nSeven years after the merger, he said, the biggest change has been better documentation of the training given to recruits on the differences between the road troopers' work and the marine division efforts on Missouri's lakes and rivers. \n \nBecause Trooper Anthony Piercy still faces criminal charges connected with Ellingson's drowning, Johnson declined to discuss the effects that case has had on the Patrol's marine operations. \n \nHe was more open about the effects of Ferguson on law enforcement overall, where the Patrol became directly involved from mid-August through Labor Day 2014. \n \nIt began as a local case, involving the Aug. 9 shooting of an 18-year-old by a local officer, but the shooting and its aftermath attracted international attention. \n \nJohnson said the Highway Patrol troopers who went to St. Louis County helped improve the situation because \"our officers are used to working by themselves. And, in doing so, you have to learn from a very young age to be able to talk with people \u2014 and talk your way out of dangerous or conflicting situations.\" \n \nJohnson said many people still may not understand the complexity of the Patrol's work \u2014 troopers do more than write traffic tickets and investigate accidents. \n \nThey also are involved in overseeing riverboat gambling operations, helping local law agencies in complex drug and crime investigations, operating laboratories that test evidence in criminal cases, and supervising the inspections of motor vehicles and school buses. \n \nAnd what's next for Johnson after his retirement? \n \n\"I'm going to reassess some things,\" he said. \"I'm going to take a little time off.\" \n \nHowever, he already has \"had a few calls\" from people interested in hiring him. \n \nHis son \u2014 who also is a trooper, based in Columbia \u2014 became a father five months ago, so there will be grandchild time. \n \nHis other son works in Chicago, so there will be some travel. \n \nJohnson's wife, Carol, retired from Jefferson City's Public Schools several years ago. \n \n\"I have a lot of habits, but not a lot of hobbies,\" Johnson said. \"We'll have to see how my wife and I will get along, being together more hours than we're used to.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Executive moves news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Johnson ready to retire after 30-year Patrol career","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cole","zipCode":"65101","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jefferson City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Jefferson City News Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"174477660","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"461"},"name":"Jefferson City News Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newstribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.mshp.dps.missouri.gov/"],"sequenceId":"695204713634","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, hit back at President Donald Trump's sudden executive order on immigration, with some leaders calling it immoral and un-American. \n \nTrump's order temporarily bars citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States even if they hold valid visas or permanent residence permits, a move that caught many companies off-guard. \n \nNetflix Inc Chief Executive Reed Hastings called it \"a sad week\" and added: \"It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.\" \n \nApple Inc CEO Tim Cook sent a letter to employees saying Trump's order was \"not a policy we support\" and promised to help affected employees. \n \n\"We have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our coworkers and our company,\" Cook added. \n \nElon Musk, the South African-born founder of Tesla and SpaceX who met recently with Trump, said on Twitter: \"The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country\u2019s challenges.\" \n \nAirbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky said: \"Not allowing countries or refugees into America is not right and we must stand with those who are affected.\" \n \nAirbnb will provide free housing to anyone not allowed into the United States, Chesky said. \n \nAaron Levie, the outspoken founder and CEO of online storage company Box Inc, said: \"The executive order on immigration is immoral and antithetical to our values.\" \n \nSTRANDED \n \nFriday's order could be a major headache for tech companies, potentially leaving employees stranded overseas and unable to return to the United States. \n \nAlphabet Inc's Google urgently called back employees from overseas and told ones who might be affected by the ban not to leave the United States. \n \nCEO Sundar Pichai said in an email to staff that more than 100 Google employees were affected by the order, according to a Google executive. \n \nOne Google employee of Iranian nationality with legal U.S. residency made it back to the United States just hours before the order took effect, the executive said. \n \n\"We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S.,\" Google said in a statement. \n \nMicrosoft Corp President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a company-wide email posted on LinkedIn that 76 company employees were citizens of the seven countries in question and held U.S. work visas, and thus were directly affected by the order. \n \nHe said the company had not determined how many people with green cards, or permanent residence status, might be affected. \n \n\"As a company, Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system,\" Smith said in the post. \"We believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings.\" \n \nUber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick, who has faced criticism from some employees for participating in President Trump's business advisory council, said in a statement that the company would compensate drivers from the seven countries who might not be able to return to the United States for three months or more. He said the company knew of about a dozen affected employees. \n \n\"This ban will impact many innocent people - an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump\u2019s first business advisory group meeting,\" Kalanick said. \n \nFacebook Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on Friday that was \"concerned\" about the order and voiced support for immigrants.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Apple news","group":"Companies"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Tim Cook, Elon Musk Sound Alarm Over Trump Immigration Order","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"News18.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"590783480","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"31"},"name":"News18.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news18.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204721813","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

These partnerships offer a variety of benefits for the partner, as well as STAR Institute, allowing for greater exposure of quality products these partners sell and to expand name recognition mutually by sharing market audiences. \n \nSTAR Institute has two new companies who are kicking off 2017 as STAR Institute Corporate Partners, Bellicon and Stokke. \u201cIt is extremely important for STAR Institute to have support from organizations like these and we thank each of these companies for their collaboration with us as they help us further our vision of a world where everyone with SPD receives support and services that result in having a meaningful and fulfilled life,\u201d explains Dick Layton, Director of STAR Institute. \n \nChewigem, Dye-namic Movement Products, FlagHouse, Integrated Listening Systems, Landscape Structures, Makoto, My Feelings, and SensaCalm are all extending their longstanding partnerships with STAR Institute through 2017. \n \n\u201cWe serve the very same community of people as the STAR Institute, so our partnership is natural,\u201d said Donna Chambers, Founder and CEO of SensaCalm.  \n \n\u201cWe chose to partner with STAR Institute, as so many families have a sensory related diagnosis in addition to other diagnoses. As parents to a child with sensory needs, we value the dual model of research and support provided by the STAR Institute. Being a national company that supports those with additional needs, it was important for us to find a like-minded corporate partner that shared our values and mission,\u201d said Shelli Smartt, owner of Chewigem USA.  \n \nThe STAR Institute thanks all of their 2017 Corporate Partners. \n \nAbout STAR Institute for Sensory Processing Disorder: \nThe STAR Institute for Sensory Processing Disorder, a Colorado 501(c)(3), is the world leader in treatment, research, and education for Sensory Processing Disorder, a neurological condition that disrupts the daily lives of more than 4 million Americans.

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\u201cMr. President, look at us,\u201d said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \u201cThis is America. What you have done is shameful. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \u201cWe are all immigrants!\u201d and \u201cNo ban! No wall!\u201d \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\u201d \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n \n\u201cThis executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \u201cPortland coffee comes from Yemen,\u201d one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n \nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \u201chashtag activist\u201d but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n \n\u201cThis was the last straw,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cWe\u2019re all immigrants.\u201d \n \nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n \nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey. \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"More protests against Trump\u2019s immigration policies planned","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lafayette","zipCode":"70506","state":"Louisiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lafayette","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"94.5 KSMB","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"194543345","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"94.5 KSMB","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ksmb.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/us-immigration-protests/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695204727182","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The interiors were designed by Pam Saftler, the developer was Port Ludlow Associates and the land planner Westharbor Homes. \n \nThe Townsend floor plan is one of five floor plans available in the Ludlow Cove Cottages neighborhood. Located on the eastern side of the Olympic Peninsula, this neighborhood of 42 cottage-style homes can be situated on a woodland, waterfront, or park-front home site. Both single-level and two-story designs are available with open concept floor plans, charming front porches, and master suites on the main level. Each home in Ludlow Cove Cottages is designed utilizing 360 degree architecture and is thoughtfully placed on home sites that offer the best possible views and vistas. \n \nThe interior of each home offers a mixture of high quality, modern fixtures and finishes, and thoughtful design, in order to transform small areas into practical living space. \u201cFantastic use of space, like the little nooks and crannies, like the reading nook. Was just so incredible, people love that, especially in a small house. Liked the composition and massing too, quite clever,\u201d said the 2016 BALA Judges. \n \nThe Townsend was also awarded the Best in the Pacific Northwest Region. Once the entries have been judged, all the platinum winners are examined within their geographic region and the BALA judges select the best of the region.

Even the simplest, most affordable homes can receive an award if they showcase good design. \n \nAward winners were announced during the annual NAHB International Builders\u2019 Show in Orlando, Florida. \n \nAdditional Information about the BALA program can be found at bestinamericanliving.com, including the 2016 BALA Portfolio, featuring a review of design trends and project photographs. \n \nAbout Westharbor Homes \n \nWestharbor Homes has been building homes for over 20 years on the Olympic and Kitsap Peninsulas.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale\u2019s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\u201cThe judge\u2019s order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US \u2014 it doesn\u2019t immediately order that they be released from detention,\u201d he told CNN. \n \n\u201cWe are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\u201d he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \u201cour courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump\u2019s controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \u201conly for nationals of countries for whom\u201d members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump\u2019s order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\u201cAmerica is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump\u2019s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump\u2019s order and pledged continued action. \n \n\u201cThis should not happen in America,\u201d Velazquez said following Darweesh\u2019s release. \u201cOne by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\u201d \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\u201cBecause the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK\u2019s Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\u201cWhen Mr. Darweesh\u2019s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u2018Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\u201d the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\u201cOur courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump\u2019s order puts those who have helped us in harm\u2019s way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, titled \u201cProtection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\u201cI am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security.\u201d \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Lafayette","zipCode":"70506","state":"Louisiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lafayette","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"94.5 KSMB","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"194543345","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"94.5 KSMB","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ksmb.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/ny-immigration-order-stay/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695204730410","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

(For a good explanation of why people think this, read our interview with \"Made in Chelsea\" start-turned-gold miner Francis Boulle. ) \n \nBitcoin, likewise, has attracted investor attention when uncertainty and risk is high. The currency spiked on Donald Trump's shock victory in the US election and bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain had a record month as a result. \n \n\"I think the world is starting to realise that, just like gold is a good hedge, bitcoin is a great hedge against the system because it\u2019s outside the system,\" says Bobby Lee, the CEO and cofounder of BTCC, one of China's three biggest bitcoin exchanges. \n \n\"Gold is sort of the hedge against the system, the status quo. Our society is ingrained with the current monetary system of fiat money, where governments issue it, they can put out as much of it as they want. Today\u2019s money system, in a very rude way, it\u2019s no different to airline miles or hotel reward points.\" \n \nLike gold, cryptocurrency is not controlled by any one central bank or country. The network is instead run by a distributed and dispersed network of computers who do the back office work required to run the system in return for bitcoins. However, the work to earn 1 bitcoin gets harder and harder, requiring more and more computing power. \n \n\"The philosophy of bitcoin is that it\u2019s a limited digital asset,\" Lee says. \"There\u2019s only 21 million bitcoin. The smallest amount you can get is not one bitcoin, you can get fractions of bitcoin. But if you own 1 bitcoin or 0.1 bitcoin you\u2019ll forever have that percentage of the world\u2019s supply. No one can dilute you. In that sense it\u2019s very attractive, it\u2019s very unique.\" \n 'A much higher percentage of drug trades are done in US dollars'  \nHowever, one thing standing in the way of bitcoin becoming a mainstream investment product is its reputation. The cryptocurrency, originally championed by hacking cliques who flew close to anarchism, has an association with the \"dark web\" and shady forums where drugs, sex, and other illegal products and services are bought and sold. \n \n\n \nLee retorts: \"Pay for drugs, hitmen, all the illegal illicit activities \u2014 sounds like you\u2019re describing the US dollar. The US dollar is also associated with drugs, drug money, cartels. Sure bitcoin can be used for that, but it can also be used for a lot of good things. I think it's a meta-narrative that\u2019s not factually based. \n \n\"I think it's a meta-narrative that\u2019s not factually based. If you want to look at facts, a much higher percentage of drug trades are done in US dollars \u2014 both in the number of instances and in the raw amounts. It\u2019s a matter of a narrative.\" \n \nHe turns to metaphor to support his point: \"A knife can be used for good things \u2014 I\u2019m using it to eat my breakfast \u2014 but it can be also used for potentially nefarious activities. It\u2019s how you choose it. You can try to eliminate all knifes and guns but it doesn\u2019t solve the problem of murder. \n \n\"Bitcoin \u2014 the question is about the causal relationship. Bitcoin itself does not cause drugs trades, just as the US dollar doesn\u2019t. I think it\u2019s more important we focus on the correct narrative \u2014 how bitcoin brings value to society. I\u2019m not concerned. I think the truth will prevail. I truly bitcoin has great functionality and great features and it will be recognised for the value it brings to society, rather than any nefarious uses.\" \n \nChina currently dominates the global trade in bitcoin and the price has been hit in recent weeks by a government-led prove on bitcoin exchanges in the country. Lee is confident that the currency can overcome these issues and is confident about the outlook for 2017. \n \n\"Four years ago bitcoin was very much used as trading in China,\" he says. \"Going forward, I think bitcoin is getting worldwide attention with demonetization events in India \u2014 they just cancelled 84% of their bank notes \u2014 and in Venezuela, with hyperinflation.\" \n   Learn more:  Credit Card Industry and Market  Mobile Payment Technologies  Mobile Payments Industry  Mobile Payment Market, Trends and Adoption  Credit Card Processing Industry  List of Credit Card Processing Companies  List of Credit Card Processing Networks  List of Payment Gateway Providers  M-Commerce: Mobile Shopping Trends  E-Commerce Payment Technologies and Trends","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Oscar Williams-Grut"},"topics":[{"name":"Gold news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"E-commerce news","group":"Internet"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Bitcoin is 'a great hedge against the system' and could be the new gold","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Business Insider UK","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"552181789","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"226"},"name":"Business Insider UK","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://uk.businessinsider.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://read.bi/pay1","http://read.bi/pay2","http://read.bi/pay3","http://read.bi/pay4","http://read.bi/pay5","http://read.bi/pay6","http://read.bi/pay7","http://read.bi/pay8","http://read.bi/pay9","http://read.bi/pay10"],"sequenceId":"695204732956","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://static1.uk.businessinsider.com/image/588783625d0bc422008b620d/bitcoin-is-a-great-hedge-against-the-system-and-could-be-the-new-gold.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

They also met in the Australian Open semi-finals in 2014, with Nadal winning each time . Nadal won the first two sets, before Federer came roaring back to take the next two on a tiebreak. \n \nThe break points continued to come thick and fast in the third set, Nadal converting his third and Dimitrov his fourth to keep the set on serve. \n \nThe unexpected reprise of one of tennis's great rivalries will be their ninth meeting in a major final, the most between any two players in the post-1968 Open era. In a sport where individual match-ups matter so much, Nadal ticks all the boxes, and despite Nadal's exertions from an epic against Grigor Dimitrov on Friday, and despite an extra day's rest for Federer , it is impossible to not have Nadal as the favourite going into Sunday's clash. \n \nMost of us thought the days of the Williams sisters playing against each other in Grand Slam finals were over. \n \nFor all their joy at reaching another Grand Slam final after serious injury problems - knee for Federer and wrist for Nadal - the importance of the match to both men can not be underestimated. In his march to the final, Federer defeated Nishikori and No. 10 seed Tomas Berdych before dispatching Mischa Zverev, who notably beat Murray in his previous match , in straight sets. \n \nFederer hadn't reached the final in Melbourne since 2010, and this marks his first Grand Slam final of any kind since 2015. \n \nIt two tiebreaks and five sets for Federer to stop the charge from Nadal , but it would prove the last time the old dog would take down the young pup in a major. \n \nFederer was watching on with relish as his rival in Sunday's final was taken the distance in a draining physical battle. It was a great match ... \n \nWawrinka struggled in the early exchanges and Federer sealed the first set with a break at 6-5 after his opponent's backhand was shown to be just out on review. Federer leads two sets to one. \"A lot of time has gone by\", Federer said. He went on to beat Federer in the final that year - his only title so far in Australia. \n \nFor Nadal , it's his second five set win of the tournament (the first over top teenager Alexander \"Sascha\" Zverev in the third round) after losing five-setters in his last three hardcourt majors. Nadal re-took the lead in characteristic style, grinding down his opponent just by staying in the rally until a exhausted shot from Dimitrov found the net. \n \nThe four-time Open champion entered the season-opening slam with only modest hopes - and certainly with no expectations to progress beyond the fourth round or quarter-finals. I played great. So was a great quality of tennis tonight. \n \nThe baseline battles continued early in the fifth, Nadal incredibly holding from 15-40 down in the eighth game. \n \nIN the debate about who is the best male player of all time , Roger Federer generally gets the nod, thanks to his record haul of 17 Grand Slams.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Susanna Cadau"},"topics":[],"title":"Australian Open 2017 - Roger Federer vs Rafael Nadal guide","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe","countryCode":"IT","country":"Italy"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Solonews.net","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"570925548","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Solonews.net","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://solonews.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204739267","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I am going to find a way to make him pay for what he did to me. \n \nAccording to The Wrestling Observer Newsletter , the highly-anticipated rematch between Goldberg and Lesnar will main event the show while Roman Reigns will battle with The Undertaker in the other high profile match. \n \n\"I wouldn't want to call it easy because there was a lot of work behind the scenes that nobody ever really got to see\", he said. So if you're asking me who will win, I'll go with Bill Goldberg. Seth is back in, but as the No. 1 entrant. \n \nKenny Omega appeared on the Wrestling Observer Radio show to discuss his future. There are so many options, and expect to see some surprises. \n \nEric Young vs. Tye Dillinger and Roderick Strong vs. Andrade \"Cien\" Almas also are featured. \n \nThere's not enough attention being placed on Cena potentially tying Ric Flair's record of 16 world titles. \n \nRoman Reigns in a No DQ match for the WWE Universal Championship with Chris Jericho in a shark cage. \n \nWhat superstar do you think will make a surprise appearance? \n \nHe has been getting a major push during the pre-Rumble season and even bigger plans are kept for him for the Wrestlemania season. \n \nTickets for Wrestlemania Axxess in Orlando will go on-sale next week, but fans can gain access to a presale starting this Monday morning. Styles complaining to Shane McMahon like that is by design. Well, they won't ignore him any more . The two-hour countdown show starts at 5 pm and the four-hour Rumble starts at 7 pm. Having Lesnar win here allows the Paul Heyman client to recapture some of the momentum he lost with that ill-advised defeat while also putting him back into the title picture, which is where he belongs as a physically imposing force who's a huge draw. \n \n\"If there's a way to get myself involved, I'll try to figure it out one way or the other\", he said. \n \nFaçade will also head overseas next month as he leaves for Nigeria on February 15 and returns on the February 21. As for the USA market, Nakamura already has every wrestling fan and NXT fan in his pocket and with his natural charisma it would probably not take him that much time to get the casual audience behind him also. \n \nThe bookings were a result of Façade wrestling on two trips to Russian Federation. \n \nBeing a little predictable and formulaic is a criticism often levied the way of the sports entertainment giant in the past, but this is one time of year you can always count on the company to produce the goods when it comes to content and storytelling. \n \nMore on Façade's experience soon. Much of that is attributed to the legends and the new (revisited) dynamic of brand competition. \n \nThere are, at time of writing, nine spots left in the 2017 Royal Rumble. \n \nThere are always a few veterans or retirees that enter the Royal Rumble so why not Booker T? \"I need an outlet and I feel like I'm not doing something WWE related right now ... it's hard to take a day off\". \n \nWWE's  Royal Rumble begins the road to the WrestleMania . He's been in NXT since 2015 and is more than ready for the challenges of the main roster (as I stated in a past post).","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Susanna Cadau"},"topics":[],"title":"James Stewart's Royal Rumble Preview: Goldberg's Road to Wrestlemania","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Southern Europe","countryCode":"IT","country":"Italy"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Solonews.net","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"570925548","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Solonews.net","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://solonews.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble","http://www.f4wonline.com/newsletter-archive/wrestling-observern","http://www.f4wonline.com/wrestling-observer-radio/wor-kenny-omega-talks-decision-he-has-made-his-wrestling-future-229081"],"sequenceId":"695204739430","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:37Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

Wade was passed. It was not the first time that Mr Pence had been present at the rally , however. Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump's senior counselor, also made an appearance. He added: \"To all of you marching - you have my full support\". \"That's why on Monday, the president reinstated the Mexico City Policy\", Pence said . \n \nIn his address to the crowd, Pence said the Trump Administration will continue working with pro-life advocates to defund Planned Parenthood, stop taxpayer funding of abortions, and ban late-term abortions. It's the 44th year of the march, but this time, many attendees said, is the first in almost a decade they feel their voices will be heard - and that's because of President Trump and Vice President Pence. \n \n\"There's been a lot of talk about numbers this past week\", Jeanne Mancini  told the hundreds of thousands of marchers. \n \n\"Every year scores of men and women visit our National Mall to peacefully march for the rights of people who can not yet march or speak for themselves, countless babies who have yet to be born\". \n \nMarko Prizmic, part of Carroll College's Pro-Life Club said he had a message for people who are pro-choice: \"We love you, and we love all humans' beings\". \n \n\"For me, being a feminist is about supporting the rights of women in the United States but also supporting women in what truly makes them feminine... the ability to create life\". \n \n\"I am speaking out for those who can't speak for themselves\", said Kathryn Burns of Macedonia, a student at Our Lady of the Elms High School who was attending her first march. But I was told you will have a very large crowd of people. \"So I just think that it's so fitting and what an honor to be there at my first event attending where our vice president will be there as well\". \"We are going to do it in a positive way\", marcher Sarah Wilkinson said. \n \nAlmost seven-in-ten Americans say Roe v. Wade should not be completely overturned, according to a Pew Research Center poll. \n \n\"He was really trying to let us know that we can trust him, and we can trust this administration, and I do trust Vice President Pence\". He later clarified that professionals should instead be the ones held responsible if abortions were no longer allowed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Historic Day at March for Life","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"South America","countryCode":"VE","country":"Venezuela"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Equilibrio Informativo","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"570998171","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Equilibrio Informativo","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://equilibrioinformativo.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://thelakeandeswave.com/2017/01/29/trump-white-house-endorses-anti-abortion-march.html","https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/nicholas-fondacaro/2017/01/26/abcs-muir-left-speechless-after-trump-brings-march-life","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-life","http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/27/massive-attendance-at-march-for-life-could-extend-crowd-size-chatter.html","https://twitter.com/o_ema/status/825011536590696451","http://www.gallup.com/poll/170249/split-abortion-pro-choice-pro-life.aspx"],"sequenceId":"695204755531","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:47Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

While the temptation is great to just stay inside where warmth and technology surround us, the crisp and stark natural landscape offers something a little different from the ho-hum daily sedentary inclination. We feel like hibernating like the bear, but so much more awaits us outside our cave.\n\nIt will be necessary to dress appropriately for the day you venture out. Providing children with proper clothing will ensure they have a warm and satisfying experience. Local suppliers can assist you in selecting warm gloves and boots. Dressing in layers is also a great strategy. An outer shell windbreaker or breathable rain jacket provides an extra buffer to winter chill.\n\nWhether you live in town or in the country, opportunities abound for getting out and enjoying nature\u2019s magic. Wildlife observation is certainly enhanced by the long lines of sight and lack of leaf cover. Bring binoculars and a bird guide out to the woods or open fields. But the intricacies of fine detail are also very visible, so have the kids concentrate on those as well.\n\nIn the woods consider woodpecker holes in trees \u2014 bring a magnifier along, but also a small ruler. Look for insects but also have the child insert the ruler into the hole and find its depth. Then measure the actual size of the hole. Is it rectangular? Circular? Oval? If there are ash trees, investigate the telltale \u201cD\u201d holes and tell the kids about the emerald ash borer and how exotic species can damage the native ecology. Use extra caution around dead ash trees, however, as dead limbs are occasionally falling. Speaking of invasive species, you may be able to identify winter forms of some of these, like wintercreeper and honeysuckle, although spring and summer will make it easier to find them. If your child needs a school project, consider documenting your adventure with photos.\n\nIf you can access a shallow, rocky creek, there is much to observe, especially if it is frozen over or at least partly so. Notice rocks protruding through the ice near the edge. Are these limestone, sandstone, shale, etc.? How did they get to this location? If there are geodes or fossil rocks this can add to the excitement. Along the edge notice the color of the ice and perhaps if there are fascinating air bubbles trapped.\n\nChildren always like stomping off some of that weak edge sheet, so let them do it, being careful that the foot does not plunge down into cold water. At any point of your exploration that the child gets really wet, head for the car.\n\nIn the snow, see if you can track creatures, large and small. There are guides to animal tracks that are very good. These guides can be found at local bookstores or the Hoosier National Forest bookstore in Bedford. In the guide it will show measurements, so use your ruler with the child to see if the size matches up. Estimate how far you can track the animal, being careful not to disturb it if you reach its sanctuary or resting place.\n\nThere are many more winter activities including sledding, introduction to snowshoeing and even cross-country skiing. Tobogganing at Pokagon State Park is another unique experience. Once again, proper clothing is a good investment to assuring the child\u2019s comfort. If your activities take place at a state park, reward the family with hot chocolate at the Inn. Or have warm drinks and snacks available in the car. Granola bars can be a staple for the hike itself or carried in a daypack. Remember, liquid is still essential, as dehydration can occur, especially during activities with lots of exertion.\n\nGoing as a group of families is another way to bond and share adventures and watch the actions of your children. Winter activities are also found as part of programs conducted by state, county and city parks or the YMCA. Here you have guided and interpretive programs. But being part of a large group takes away that close intimate family-only bonding that can be so rewarding, so perhaps try your own adventure first. Additional ideas, activities and experiences can be found on websites from around the country. See what other families do in our vast winter landscapes. Visit the website \u201cTales of a Mountain Mama \u201c or \u201cTaiga Trekkers\u201d and you will be thrilled to know that almost everywhere you live families are getting out there in winter to celebrate just like you!\n\nCarroll Ritter is an environmental education consultant with Outdoor Connections.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Carroll Ritter Special to the Hoosier Times"},"topics":[],"title":"Families should bundle up, get out, make the most of winter","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Morgan","zipCode":"46151","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Martinsville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Martinsville Reporter-Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665162","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Martinsville Reporter-Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://reporter-times.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204758559","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/reporter-times.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/73/b73c8870-e2ce-5004-a1a9-2ba2945e7881/5888d9c7331dd.image.jpg?resize=800%2C536"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/reporter-times.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/73/b73c8870-e2ce-5004-a1a9-2ba2945e7881/5888d9c7331dd.image.jpg?resize=300%2C201"}],"video":[]}}

That will change in March, when trout will be launched from a special tank truck into the water of the 26-acre lake.\n\nSpring Mill Lake is now a good lake for stocking trout because of the dredging project that improved conditions for fish and angler alike. In 2006, the last year the trout were stocked at the lake, biologists had to \u201cpunch holes in the weeds\u201d to allow the fish to find their way to deeper water from along the shoreline, according to Dave Kittaka, fisheries biologist with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources Division of Fish and Wildlife.\n\n\u201cFishing was difficult in that lake for any species,\u201d Kittaka said. But now that conditions have improved, he\u2019s hoping 750 8- to 10-inch rainbow trout will be placed in the lake.\n\n\u201cWe basically have a new lake with newfound depth,\u201d Kittaka said. \u201cThe water that comes out of those caves, Twin and Shawnee, keeps the water temperature cold.\u201d\n\nKittaka said the trout are currently housed at the East Fork State Fish Hatchery in Daviess County, where they will continue to live until they are placed into Spring Mill and three other Indiana lakes \u2014 Maple Avenue Nature Park in Terre Haute, Airline Pit in Greene-Sullivan State Forest and Midland Lake in Hillenbrand Fish and Wildlife Area. There will also be stockings in other areas across the state, he said.\n\n\u201cThese fish are what we call put-and-take trout,\u201d Kittaka said. \u201cWe put them in the lake so people can catch them and take them home.\u201d He added that the likelihood of the trout reproducing is \u201czero.\u201d But if any of the fish aren\u2019t caught during the year, there is a good chance they will survive into the next year.\n\nOne of the concerns with stocking rainbow trout into Spring Mill Lake is that a family of river otters now lives there. Otters eat fish, lots of fish.\n\nAlthough the otters may eat some of the rainbow trout, Kittaka said it\u2019s more likely the otters will eat the fish that are easiest to catch. That\u2019s not rainbow trout. The likely dinner for the otters are the bottom-feeding fish found in the lake, suckers and common carp. These fish, known as rough fish, are plentiful because people don\u2019t fish for them and are easier to catch.\n\nIn contrast, the rainbow trout will be in the water column of the lake and have more room to escape.\n\nRainbow trout will be stocked into Spring Mill Lake for the next five years, Kittaka said. Dredging the lake was just the first step in making the lake more of an attraction to visitors. There are also plans for a new boat ramp, fishing docks and more.\n\nFishermen and women at Spring Mill Lake will be asked to fill out a fish survey to help state biologists better know how many trout have been caught, Kittaka said. The hope is the survey will give them a better idea of interest in fishing at the lake as well as how many fish have been taken.\n\nAnyone who wants to fish for trout in Indiana must have an $11 trout and salmon privilege stamp as well as a fishing license. The stamps can be purchased anywhere fishing licenses are sold. The inland trout program is funded through the stamp funds. The daily bag limit for trout is five fish per day. Minimum size limit is 7 inches.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Rainbow trout coming back to Spring Mill Lake in March","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Morgan","zipCode":"46151","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Martinsville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Martinsville Reporter-Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169665162","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Martinsville Reporter-Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://reporter-times.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204758730","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/reporter-times.com/content/tncms/custom/image/7d384d9e-2b1f-11e5-b573-6b82e880093f.png?_dc=1436984995"}],"video":[]}}

That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country. \n \nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely. \n \nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa. \n \nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government. \n \nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban. \n \n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said. \n \n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals. \n \n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\" \n \nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination. \n \n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said. \n \n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\" \n \nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. \n \nAn emergency stay issued by a US federal judge has temporarily stopped the government from sending those who landed with valid visas out of the country. \n \nCrowds of protesters have gathered at US airports in response to the order and subsequent detainments. \n \nThe story Qantas offers refunds to Australians affected by Trump's 'Muslim ban' first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Qantas offers refunds to Australians affected by Trump's 'Muslim ban'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2777","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Springwood","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Blue Mountains Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661357","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Blue Mountains Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bluemountainsgazette.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204766625","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:31:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Another pulled me aside to enquire if I\u2019d needed a bodyguard. I had, in fact, been on a 10-day tour of Iran, journeying by luxury coach from the southern city of Shiraz to the capital, Tehran, with a group of 15 other adventurous souls. \n \nTheir confusion was understandable. I\u2019d probably have reacted the same way before experiencing first-hand the utterly beguiling yet much-misunderstood country. After all, back in 2002 Iran was lumped, together with North Korea and Iraq, into US President George W Bush\u2019s \u201caxis of evil.\u201d Since then, unrelenting media coverage of its controversial nuclear programme, placard-waving hate mobs and \u201cDeath to America\u201d murals have done little to dispel this stereotype\u2014but change is afoot. \n \nFollowing last summer\u2019s nuclear deal and the recent lifting of economic sanctions, the world is starting to see Iran as something other than a threat. European governments, including the UK\u2019s, are relaxing travel warnings and the Islamic republic is rapidly becoming a \u201cmust-visit\u201d destination. With its incredible ancient monuments, imperial palaces, dazzlingly decorated mosques, bustling bazaars, breathtaking landscapes, and no less than 20 Unesco World Heritage sites, it\u2019s like no other country I\u2019ve visited and rightly deserves a place on travel hotlists.   \n \nAs for the Iranian people, well, at times a bodyguard might come in handy if only to manage the sheer number of well-wishers who\u2019ll greet you on the streets with big smiles and endless questions. You only need exchange a few simple pleasantries and bingo, you\u2019ll be invited to pull up a chair at their family dinner table. Iranians are intensely proud of their national cuisine and will openly, and ardently, share their frustration about the lack of dishes available to tourists. This is because outside Tehran, the majority of restaurants only serve a monotonous menu of kebabs\u2014for lunch and dinner.   \n \nAs Anthony Bourdain reveals in the Iran episode of his food flavoured Parts Unknown travel series, \u201cThis is a land of secret recipes passed down through families like treasured possessions.\u201d He\u2019s referring to delicious, complex and time-consuming dishes that are mainly served in the home: cardamom infused rice layered with chicken and barberries; pomegranate, walnut and meatball stew; lamb koftas with cranberry, cumin and pine nuts drizzled with spiced orange yoghurt. So if you want something other than sizzling slabs of meat for 10 days straight, just smile, say \u201csalaam\u201d and you\u2019ll eat like a Persian king or queen.  \n \nIran is certainly a country of contradictions and contrasts, and this will be a constant source of fascination as you explore its riches. For example, the city at the start of our tour, Shiraz, shares its name with the world-famous grape variety. The surrounding hills were once blanketed with vines that produced excellent wines, but today not one bottle is produced in the region\u2014or anywhere in Iran. Alcohol has been forbidden since the Pahlavi dynasty was ousted in the Iranian Revolution of 1979, which imposed Islamic law and theocratic rule. Even the word wine is banned from books published in the Islamic republic.  \n \nThe punishment for possessing or imbibing is at best a hefty fine, possibly a public lashing\u2014 or in extreme cases, execution.  \n \nDespite the severe penalties, I discovered alcohol consumption is widespread\u2014behind closed doors. I got the low-down from a daringly candid group of forty-something Shirazis I met while trying the local delicacy faloodeh, a refreshing but intensely sweet sorbet textured with noodles and doused with rose or lime syrup. As we sat around the dessert stall in the shade of a blossoming orange tree, a man whipped out his mobile phone and scrolled through a list of names with the suffix \u201c.drink,\u201d the first one being \u201cSaeed.drink.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t have bars or nightclubs anymore,\u201d he explained, \u201cso we throw parties secretly at home or we hire villas out in the countryside with DJs. Men and women wear what they like. We call up these illegal alcohol sellers, like people in America might call their drug dealers,\u201d he says, sending his pals into fits of nervous titters, \u201cand they come with their car boots filled with every type of alcohol you could imagine. Sure, it\u2019s expensive, but we want to party just like everyone else.\u201d \n \nA more reputable pastime in Iran is picnicking, and Shirazis are indisputably the nation\u2019s best. Not just in public gardens, but on pavements, between parked cars and even on the grassy centres of mini-roundabouts. Cast an inquisitive glance and earn yourself  a place on their rug.  \n \nYou\u2019d be forgiven for thinking boxing is a popular sport in Shiraz, given the number of black eyes and bandaged noses you\u2019ll spot on the busy streets. Our guide laughs at the suggestion and flags down a passing couple bearing injuries. Proudly, these complete strangers unabashedly talk us through the cosmetic procedures they underwent two months earlier. Another couple of strangers stop to show off identical, slightly upturned, doll-like noses sculpted about a year ago. \n \nIran is the nose-job capital of the world and far from being embarrassed, Iranians wear their bandages with pride, like a Birkin or Louboutins. Such is the prestige associated with plastic surgery that there is even a trend for faking it. Young Iranians\u2014both men and women\u2014use make-up to blacken their eyes and bandage their noses to give the impression they\u2019ve gone under the knife.  \n \nThat the pursuit of beauty through cosmetic surgery is so widespread and accepted is bemusing in a country that requires women, by law, to cover their head and hair in public, and to wear loose-fitting clothes to hide feminine curves\u2014with failure to comply risking fines, flogging or imprisonment. But Iran is rapidly changing and the strict religious dress code is being pushed to its limit, especially in the main cities, where you\u2019ll see women in skinny jeans, skyscraper heels, daringly tight manteaus (long jackets), heavy make-up and headscarves covering little but the tips of their ponytails.  \n \nWhile it would be easy to fill your days just strolling, chatting and soaking up the local culture, our bespoke itinerary\u2014crafted by luxury tour operator Country Holidays as part of its Signature Departures collection\u2014was packed from dawn to dusk. It was a little exhausting at times but there\u2019s not one site I\u2019d skip\u2014even if it did mean 6am wake-up calls on most days. Upgrading to a Signature Departures tour guaranteed us a more personal experience thanks to the small size of the group (16 is the maximum), expert guides, thoughtfully curated dining experiences and well-chosen hotels.  \n \nOur first day in Shiraz was epic, starting with the Nasir-ol-Molk Mosque, where we were bathed in kaleidoscopic light as the morning sun blazed through beautiful stained-glass windows. Other highlights included Narenjestan-e Qavam, a gorgeous 19th-century house and garden with orange groves and a central canal, and the tomb of the famous 14th-century poet Shamsuddin Muhammad Hafez, a son of Shiraz. \n \nWhile visiting the tomb, pay one of the canary wielding men at the main gate and his bird will pull from a box a piece of paper bearing one of Hafez\u2019s verses. Like a fortune teller, the bird\u2019s master will interpret the words\u2019 significance for you. At the nearby tomb of Saadi, a famous poet from the 13th century, men gather to sing heartfelt renditions of his poetry under the mausoleum\u2019s mosaic dome.  \n \nOn day two, we head out to the ancient ruins of Persepolis, whose name means \u201cCity of Persians.\u201d Built more than 2,000 years ago as the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid empire, the crumbling monuments and tombs strewn across a dry, barren landscape are a phenomenal reminder of the majesty and might of the once-great civilisation.  \n \nWe wake the following day in the desert city of Yazd, home to one of the world\u2019s oldest religions, Zoroastrianism. The sombre-sounding Towers of Silence make for an intriguing, if a little eerie, start to the day. The circular hilltop monuments are where the Zoroastrians once left their dead to be eaten by vultures and wild dogs. These \u201csky burials\u201d were supposedly banned in the 1960s as the city began to sprawl and residents started making grisly discoveries in their yards. \n \nAfter a whirlwind 24 hours in Yazd, we bid farewell to its memorable skyline dotted with wind towers\u2014a traditional form of natural air conditioning\u2014and punctuated by the turquoise-tiled minarets of the Jameh Mosque, and make the four-hour journey to Isfahan.  \n \nThere\u2019s a saying in Iran that Isfahan is \u201chalf the world,\u201d something Country Holidays must have taken into account when dedicating two days and three nights of our tour to this beautiful city. It\u2019s also home to one of the country\u2019s most famous hotels, the Abbasi, which although rather underwhelming on the inside, has a beautiful central courtyard blooming with flowers and dotted with frothing fountains.  \n \nThe best place to immerse yourself in local life is Isfahan\u2019s elegant and spacious Imam Square, a former polo field once watched over by the king from the nearby Ali Qapu Palace. Behind the archways that fringe the square is a bustling, maze-like bazaar dating back to the 17th century where you can snap up the fiery red stigmas of saffron for a bargain price, traditional blue and white enamel dishes, Persian rugs, camel bone jewellery boxes and a delicious nougat-like local speciality called gaz. From the \n \nFrom the square you can explore the Imam Mosque, the Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque and the palace. Their blazing blue-tiled mosaic arches, impossibly intricate geometric domes and spiralling carved columns are all showstopping examples of Islamic architecture. As the sun sinks towards the horizon, head to Si-o-Seh Bridge, where the locals regularly break into song or impromptu performances of poetry. \n \nAfter a brief visit to the remote mountain village of Abyaneh\u2014a labyrinth of red mudbrick houses where villagers in traditional dress stroll with their donkeys\u2014Tehran comes as a slap in the face. But once you\u2019ve adjusted to the insane traffic and smog, the designer boutiques, blossoming cafe culture, cool art galleries and fine dining start to feel as familiar as any Asian or European capital. Preconceptions about Iranian fashion sense go out the window in Tehran, where luxury shopping is becoming big business. \n \nTrendy malls are springing up, emblazoned with glossy advertising for prestige brands such as Louis Vuitton and Rolex. The growing curiosity for couture saw Iran hold its first Fashion Week in the capital last year, and a snoop on Instagram\u2019s Rich Kids of Tehran shows young Iranians are not only obsessed with designer logos, but also with supercars, private jets and gold-plated smartphones. \n \nLast year the capital received a creative jolt when 1,500 billboards were adorned with replicas of works by local artists and famous names such as Picasso, Matisse and Munch, along with traditional Persian miniatures, carpets and calligraphy. Titled \u201cA Gallery as Big as a Town,\u201d the 10-day project was aimed at changing perceptions about the city and boosting visitor numbers. Judging by the crowds jostling to see the treasures at the National Museum of Archaeology and the long queues at the National Jewellery Museum, the campaign certainly did its job. \n \nMake sure you catch a glimpse of the latter\u2019s pink diamond, said to be the largest uncut diamond in the world, and the Globe of Jewels, made in 1869 using 51,366 precious stones. Also make time to marvel at the craftsmanship of Iran\u2019s most famous export at the National Carpet Museum. Other highlights include Golestan Palace, the jewel-encrusted former home of the Qajar royal family, and the Azadi Tower, a striking 50m-high monument built in 1971 to commemorate the 2,500th anniversary of the founding of the first Persian empire. \n \nWhile the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is definitely worth a visit, art connoisseurs and collectors looking for investment opportunities should do a sweep of the city\u2019s top art galleries (see right). Interest in modern and contemporary Iranian art intensified last year, with record amounts being paid. A work by the late Sohrab Sepehri became the most expensive painting to sell at auction in Iran, fetching about US$800,000 last May. Other works attracting large sums include those of New York-based artist Manoucher Yektai and Vancouver-based sculptor Parviz Tanavoli, as well as pieces by Bahman Mohassess and Aydin Aghdashloo.  \n \nIt\u2019s also worth venturing off the beaten track to discover the work of Tehran\u2019s law-defying street artists. The most famous and prolific is the Banksy-esque Mehdi Ghadyanloo, who works secretly through the night to transform drab concrete surfaces into surreal magical dreamscapes featuring flying cars, fairies and giraffes.  \n \nWhile the number of people visiting Iran is still relatively low, industry experts predict the country will be the next travel hotspot. Late last year, France\u2019s Accor Hotels became the first Western hospitality group to enter the Iranian market\u2014a hint of a tourism boom to come. So if you want to hold court at a dinner party with exclusive tales of this enchanting country, go now. In the words of the 14th-century Persian poet Rumi, \u201cTravel brings power and love back to your life.\u201d Expect to be smitten.  \n \n(Text by Jakki Phillips; Photo by Lucie Debelkova)   \n \nTags: Travel , Destination , Shiraz To Tehran , Iran \n  \nWorld\u2019s Largest Hotel Chains Opens First Golf Resort in China \n  travel","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer: travel news","group":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Travel From Shiraz to Tehran, Unveiling the True Beauty of Iran","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"ID","country":"Indonesia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Indonesia Tatler","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"191630188","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Indonesia Tatler","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["TravelTourism","Recreation","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indonesiatatler.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204784598","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:32:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Most services, except essential ones like primary healthcare and basic education, will be covered by GST. \n\nService tax was budgeted to provide Rs 2.31 lakh crore in 2016-17, more than 14 per cent of the Centres total tax revenues of Rs 16.30 lakh crore. \n\nThis will be the third time that Jaitley will raise service tax rate. Service tax from June 1, 2015 was hiked from 12.36 per cent to 14 per cent. A 0.5 per cent Swachh Bharat Cess was levied on all services, taking the total incidence of service tax to 14.5 per cent from November 15, 2015. \n\nIn the last Budget, he imposed a Krishi Kalyan Cess at the rate of 0.5 per cent on all taxable services to take the levy to 15 per cent.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Tax news","group":"Finance"}],"title":"FM may hike service tax to 16-18% in Budget","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Deccan Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658157","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"67"},"name":"Deccan Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanherald.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204789268","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:51:47Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:32:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Morty Ortega/ \n\nRelated content \n\n(CNN) - More protests against President Donald Trump's immigration policies are set for Sunday across the country after hundreds of demonstrators converged on airports the day before. \n\nProtests are scheduled Sunday in Washington, Orlando, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle, and Chicago, mostly at airports. \n\nThis is the second weekend of demonstrations, with more than 1 million people coming out last weekend for the Women's March. \n\nOlivia Katbi Smith told CNN affiliate KATU she showed up Saturday at Portland International Airport because she believes Trump's immigration policies are cruel. \n\n\"I think it's horrific and terrible and we are basically condemning people to death by not allowing them to come here,\" she said. \n\nShe said the event appeared to be impromptu. She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n\nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n\n\"Mr. President, look at us,\" said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \"This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American.\" \n\nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \"We are all immigrants!\" and \"No ban! No wall!\" \n\nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n\nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n\n\"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" Cuomo said. \n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \"What's happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\" \n\nAirport arrests \n\nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n\nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \"President Trump's new Muslim ban.\" \n\nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n\nThat move limited part of President Trump's executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n\n\"This executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\" he said in a statement. \n\nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \"Portland coffee comes from Yemen,\" one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n\nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \"hashtag activist\" but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n\n\"This was the last straw,\" she said of Trump's policies. \"We're all immigrants.\" \n\nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n\nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"More protests against Trump's immigration policies planned","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"El Paso","zipCode":"80905","state":"Colorado","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Colorado Springs","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KRDO.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663107","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"18"},"name":"KRDO.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.krdo.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204792728","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:32:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Margaret C. Warn-Walker (Photo: Courtesy photo) \n  \nThe thing I love about Abilene is our residents\u2019 willingness to allow people their own beliefs and opinions even if they are different than theirs. \n \nThe people of Abilene have a devout love for God and a desire to live up to God\u2019s expectations, as well as to hold the dignity and respect of all humanity as an important value.  All the faiths represented in the Abilene community promote the love of God and stress its reflection in our loving actions toward one another. It is also a city where people seek out an understanding of other faiths, ideas and political opinions. \n \nSo, in a city that prides itself in living its spiritual values and understanding those of others, I am often asked  what position my church, Exodus Metropolitan Community Church, has on various issues. The election and the new administration was no exception. \n \nAs a church and as individuals, we respect the office of president,whether held by a Republican, Democrat or Independent. As individuals, we may agree or disagree with candidates on various policies. Collectively, we take our responsibility to vote seriously, and we encourage people to speak out when they believe human rights are being violated, or the people of the country are being hurt, bullied or forgotten. \n \nWe also have a homeless outreach as well as several educational outreaches to raise awareness and meet needs in our community and abroad. As a church, locally and internationally, we stand and support the following ideas which we believe to be in keeping with the will of God. \n \n●     First and foremost, Exodus MCC believes in an inclusive, loving God who sees no racial, national or gender boundaries. We are required to love God with all our being and our neighbor as ourselves. We believe that love is not just a feeling but a feeling translated into action that meets the needs of others. An inauguration is about beginnings, but EMCC has never stopped holding up its core values of human rights, respect, and freedom that are basic to the teachings of Jesus whose life and teachings we follow. \n \nIn regards to political and social actions, we: \n \n● hold any administration \u2014 local, state, or national \u2014 accountable for harmful policies and actions. We speak out, meet with our representatives, and let our dream for a whole and healthy country be known to our elected officials. \n \n● believe any violent rhetoric and actions are not partisan politics but dangerous tactics, which create a climate of intolerance and hate. We require that the dignity of all persons be respected. \n \n● name and reject the rising tide of hate crimes against immigrants, people of color, Muslims, the aged, handicapped, LGBTQ people and any other individual or group targeted because of who or what they are. \n \n● deplore the use of derogatory labels. Hateful labels shatter public discourse. Name-calling is the infancy of bullying which evolves into action. If we don't stand up for those being targeted, how can we expect to be defended? \n \n●  would like to see America whole \u2014 through health care for all, through women's health and reproductive rights, through immigrant family reunion, through defending the integrity of Native lands, through support for public schools, jobs  for all, elder care, racial justice and care for the planet. \n \nThe Rev. Margaret C. Warn-Walker is senior pastor of Exodus Metropolitan Community Church in Abilene. \n\n \nRead or Share this story: http://arnne.ws/2jDk1NL","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Margaret C.

It was definitely controversial, but the response on Facebook had me mystified. \n \nI worked at the Reporter-News for a couple of years and I have a unique perspective as a former employee of the paper. I sold ads in the advertising department. It was obvious there was a lot of misinformation on Facebook about how a newspaper operates. \n \nOne of the first things I learned at the ARN is the editorial department is completely separate from the advertising department: editorial is upstairs, advertising is downstairs. The paper did not want even a suggestion that advertisers and their dollars spent could influence what is printed in the editorial content of the paper. It was like having two different companies in the same building. \n \nWhen I did see an editorial person, they were usually sprinting through the advertising department to get to the nearby bathroom! \n \nI called the woman who was, at the time, my supervisor at the paper\u2026.a Christian and a conservative. To be totally transparent, I am conservative, too. \n \nWe were speculating how this ad might have been printed. We agreed there are lots of ways it could have happened. Now, I don\u2019t know how this controversial ad actually went to print, but I can assure you the \"liberal editors\" upstairs were not responsible. Something happened in the advertising process. To suggest that this ad is an act of liberalism by the editorial staff is ludicrous and is totally against the internal policies of the paper. \n \nA lot of kind, caring, involved, giving people work at the newspaper and live in our community. Their kids play with our kids. They go to church, pray and volunteer with us. They\u2019re our neighbors and friends. They get up every day (and night) to cover stories they think will be of interest to us. \n \nThe Abilene Reporter-News also supports and sponsors many events and activities here in the Big Country. We may not agree with the editorial views, but we can certainly appreciate the local stories and events they cover and their contributions to our city. If an ad offends us, we can turn the page. If we don't agree with an editorial, we can be vocal and let them know or even write an op-ed piece like this one to express our own ideas and opinions. \n \nIf you don't value our hometown newspaper, talk to someone who no longer has a newspaper in their town. \n \nWhen we go after the paper, we're not only hurting the newspaper, we\u2019re hurting the hard working people there and our community.

Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi address the press in Lucknow (ANI photo)   \nUttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi are addressing the press in Lucknow right now ahead of their scheduled road show.  \n \nThe two leaders, whose respective parties recently announced an alliance for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, are appearing together for the first time since the the alliance between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party was announced. \n \nHere are the latest updates: \n Both the leaders avoid answering how the seats in Rae Bareilly and Amethi, both bastions of the Gandhi family, will be divided between the Congress and SP.  We are going to fight united and show the BJP that you cannot divide this country, you cannot trample over the people in this country and win elections: Rahul.  Akhilesh echoes Rahul on whether Dimple Yadav, the UP CM's wife, will be on the campaign trail.  On whether Priyanka campaigning, Rahul says it's a decision that's up to her.  SP- Congress alliance in Lok Sabha not yet discussed, but is a possibility, the Congress vice president says.  Our goal is to defeat the RSS-BJP ideology: Rahul  This is a historical alliance, Gandhi says, responding to a reporter's question.   Uttar Pradesh's DNA holds brotherhood and progress, not anger, Rahul Gandhi says.  'Ache din waalon ne ache din dikhaaye nai' (Those who meant to show us the good days haven't shown us the good days), Akhilesh says, taking a dig at PM Narendra Modi .  The two parties, Rahul adds, are fighting the election together based on their similarities.  We want to bring a new kind of politics to Uttar Pradesh, the Congress leader.  The country and its people are hurting because of politics of anger, says Rahul.  We are two wheels of a cycle moving towards development, says Akhilesh on alliance.  Together, Congress and the SP will speed up the progress and prosperity in UP, the CM adds.    There is no doubt that we will secure a majority in the Assembly election, Akhilesh says.  People want this alliance to succeed, Yadav adds.   We've known each other, but I am happy that we now get to work together, UP CM Akhilesh says.  This is a triple P: Progress, prosperity and peace, says the Congress vice president.  This is like the meeting of Ganga and Yamuna, says Rahul.  Rahul hugs Akhilesh once. Cameramen request for an encore. The duo. They oblige.  Theme song prepared for SP-Congress alliance plays before the two address the gathering.  \n The Congress is contesting 105 seats while the ruling Samajwadi Party is contesting 298 seats.

Trump, and threatening to \u201ccut off the Feds\u201d by withholding taxes.  \nAccording to CBS San Francisco , former State Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, Jr. said: \u201cCalifornia could very well become an organized non-payer. \u2026 They could recommend non-compliance with the federal tax code.\u201d Democrats are considering the tax revolt as part of what CBS San Francisco called an \u201call-out war\u201d against the Trump administration, which could also include holding back state transfers of funds to the federal government. \n  \nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \n  \nThe list of potential state transfers to Washington is limited, however, according to one expert on the inner workings of California\u2019s government contacted by Breitbart News, who did not wish to be named. He cited the handful of areas where the State of California remits large dollar amounts, including biweekly federal tax withholding from millions of state workers, and worker\u2019s compensation fund payments. \n \nCalifornia is often described as a \u201cdonor state,\u201d  meaning that California remits more money than it takes in federal funds to keep hundreds of entitlement programs afloat. While that may be true, it does not paint an accurate picture of California\u2019s finances. \n \nAs Governor Jerry Brown admitted in his \u201cState of the State\u201d speech last week, the Golden State is dependent on \u201ctens of billions of dollars\u201d to keep Covered California (California\u2019s version of ObamaCare) afloat, such that losing it would blow a hole in California\u2019s budget, creating a massive shortfall. \n \nIf state officials move to stop federal withholdings, that would put California state workers in a very precarious position, and could have profound consequences for the state as a non-compliant employer \u2014 not to mention massive financial penalties that could be assessed. \n \nCalifornia Democrats are accustomed to steamrolling over the weak opposition, to say nothing of crushing individual business large and small, often taking on entire industries like the twin behemoths \u2014 oil and agriculture \u2014 and forcing them to comply or die. \n \n(Remember the Amazon sales tax fight in California?  The world\u2019s most valuable company folded like an empty suit in a hurricane.) \n \nBut California Democrats have never dealt with anyone like our new president.  President Donald J. Trump is not likely to tolerate lawlessness and defiance from a petulant blue minority in a nation turned red. Threats to cut off what would not even amount to 10% of the money flowing from California to Washington, D.C. could trigger President Trump turning off the spigot altogether \u2014 essentially drying up the almost 80% of California funds that are returned to the state in federal funding. \n \nDemocrats, drunk on local power, seem to have forgotten the lessons of 1992 , when Republican Governor Pete Wilson came out and announced, \u201cThis morning, California is running on empty,\u201d and the state began issuing I.O.U.\u2019s in lieu of payment for the first time since the Great Depression. \n \nFailing to remit worker\u2019s compensation funds put California in arrears for decades. \n \nDo Democrats really want to risk California\u2019s solvency by throwing sand in the eye of the Leviathan? \n \nIf the Trump administration holds the \u201cTrump card\u201d simply by shutting off the subsidies for one program \u2014 and Gov. Brown admits they do when it comes to ObamaCare funding \u2014 it is clear which side holds the leverage. \n \nCalifornia is particularly vulnerable because of the dependence of many illegal aliens on public assistance, and on the federal earned income tax credit. \n \nWith the stroke of a pen, President Trump could shut down the state by cutting off or delaying funds. \n \nMoreover, federal funds fuel almost every major institution in California, including: \n Military Bases  K-12 Schools  Public Colleges and Universities (Federal funds, student loans)  Airports  Ports  Federal contracts with technology and defense companies  \nSince the California Constitution forbids deficit funding, the state cannot live off credit cards alone. \n \nWith over $400 billion in debt, and with a state pension system dangerously underfunded, a sustained battle with the federal government would break the already broke state. \n \nTim Donnelly is a former California State Assemblyman. \n \nAuthor,  Patriot Not Politician: Win or Go Homeless \n \nFaceBook:  https://www.facebook.com/tim.donnelly.12/ \n \nTwitter:   @PatriotNotPol","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Assemblyman Tim Donnelly"},"topics":[{"name":"Tax news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"California Democrats Threaten to Stop Paying Federal Taxes","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Breitbart.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657724","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6715"},"name":"Breitbart.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Organisations","Government"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.breitbart.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/01/27/california-could-cut-off-feds-in-response-to-trump-threats/","http://www.lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3531/2","http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/15/business/la-fi-mo-amazon-collecting-ca-sales-tax-20120915","http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/02/us/california-forced-to-turn-to-iou-s.html","http://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/California-s-400-billion-debt-worries-analysts-6812264.php","http://patriotnotpolitician.com/","https://www.facebook.com/tim.donnelly.12/","https://twitter.com/PatriotNotPol"],"sequenceId":"695204803660","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:26:01Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:32:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

On the other hand, flush with liquidity, a majority of banks (82 per cent of those polled) reported a rise in their low cost CASA deposits during the period July-December 2016. \n \nIn fact, 53 per cent of the respondent banks reported a substantial increase in CASA deposits and attributed the same to demonetisation, besides their own efforts to mobilise opening of savings account. \n \nNotably, in the previous survey round, only 25 per cent of respondents had reported a substantial increase, while 50 per cent had reported a moderate increase in such deposits. \n \nLenders believe a hike in foreign direct investment (FDI) limit for state-owned banks (from 20 per cent to 49 per cent) will help in raising further capital and thereby meeting capital requirements under Basel-III norms. \n \nIn the Budget, banks also expect the government to boost consumption demand and investment through reduction in corporate as well as personal income tax, and by providing additional deductions under section 80C and interest on home loans. \n \nWith a thrust on less-cash economy, banks are also eyeing additional incentives for digital transactions, including tax benefits for customers as well as merchants. They have also urged for enhancing capital expenditure, especially for infrastructure. Other key suggestions include measures to fast track NPA resolution, creation of a Central Corporate Repository and interest payment on CRR balance. \n \nBanks also felt interest subvention for farm loans should be parked with them in advance, as it takes 7-8 months for settlement of claims, leading to interest loss. They also want the government to announce additional tax incentives for customers on term deposits, such as reduction in lock-in period for tax saver fixed deposits, and increase in tax exemption limit for interest income from term deposits. \n \nThe survey revealed that iron and steel, infrastructure and textiles continue to account for a large concentration of non-performing assets (NPAs). Overall, the number of banks reporting a rise in the level of NPAs is lower in the current round of the survey as against the preceding round. \n \nWhile 76 per cent of the participating banks reported a rise in the level of NPAs during July-December, 85 per cent had reported so for the preceding six month period. Going forward, the key sectors identified by banks which could see a greater demand for long term credit include infrastructure, automobiles and food processing.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Banking news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Banks eyeing big-ticket reforms in Budget: survey","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Deccan Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673440","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"137"},"name":"Deccan Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204824151","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:32:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I\u2019m here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. \n \n\n \nThe agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n \nNEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n \nMore than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who\u2019d rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \n \nFAIRFAX, VIRGINIA \n \nDozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. \n \n\n \nTerry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. \n \nDENVER \n \nDozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" \n \n\n \nDenver has some direct international flights but it wasn\u2019t clear whether anyone has been detained under the president\u2019s executive order. \n \nCHICAGO \n \nA crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O\u2019Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O\u2019Hare\u2019s international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n \nLawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O\u2019Hare all released by late Saturday. \n \nAmong those released before the federal judge\u2019s order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n \n\n \nNoorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O\u2019Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n \nThe couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n \nAfter Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can\u2019t believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" \n \nDALLAS \n \nProtesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump\u2019s executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n \nAmong those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son\u2019s petition. \n \nBahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn\u2019t talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n \nHundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \n \nImmigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n \n\n \n\"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n \nHassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n \n\"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n \nHonarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n \n\"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" \n \nSEATTLE \n \nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, sitting down in the concourse with a large American flag reading \"We are America.\" Aayah Khalaf, a Muslim American, was sitting at home watching the protest on television when she and her friend studying from Egypt decided to join the rally. It was her second time joining a protest. \n \n\n \nThe first one was the Women\u2019s March. \"It\u2019s not just against Muslims. It against environmental rights and human rights overall. I think everybody has to stand up against this,\" said Khalaf, 29. \n \nPORTLAND, OREGON \n \nA protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\" \n \n\n \nLOS ANGELES \n \nAbout 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. Protesters entered the airport\u2019s Tom Bradley International Terminal after holding a candlelight vigil. \n \n\n \nAvriel Epps held a candle and a large photo a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy who washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 and became a haunting symbol of the Syrian refugee crisis. \n \nSAN FRANCISCO \n \nHundreds of protesters blocked the street outside at San Francisco International Airport\u2019s international terminal to express their opposition to the barring of some people from Muslim-majority nations. \n \n\n \nSAN DIEGO \n \nAs motorists honked their support, demonstrators outside San Diego International Airport chanted \"No hate, no fear, everyone is welcome here.\" ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Political unrest news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Protests erupt at US airports following Trump travel ban","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"PK","country":"Pakistan"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dunya News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659693","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"41"},"name":"Dunya News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dunyanews.tv"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204826353","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:32:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He's in great form and we're looking forward to another good performance.\"\n\nMullins has won every running of the event since current sponsors BHP Insurance became involved in 2011, with Hurricane Fly winning on five occasions before Faugheen's victory a year ago.\n\nThe champion trainer said: \"It's most unfortunate Faugheen misses the race, but he wasn't right yesterday morning and seems to have a muscle problem in his hindquarters.\n\n\"We still have two good horses to represent us and we think Nichols Canyon, who didn't perform when beaten by Petit Mouchoir at Christmas, is back in better form now.\n\n\"As a seven-time Grade 1 winner, he fully deserves a shot at the race. We'll see how things go before deciding whether we keep him to two miles or go back up in trip.\n\n\"Footpad, who won two Grade 1s as a juvenile last season, is difficult to place. While he was well beaten behind Petit Mouchoir and Nichols Canyon in the Ryanair Hurdle last time, we decided to let him take his chance as there is nice prize-money to be won.\"\n\nCompleting the line-up is last year's JCB Triumph Hurdle winner Ivanovich Gorbatov, who has failed to score in six attempts since his Cheltenham Festival victory and who finished third behind Petit Mouchoir and Nichols Canyon last time.\n\nHis trainer Joseph O'Brien said: \"He's in good form and has been coming along steadily. If he can improve another bit he should give a good account. The ground will suit and he's run well at Leopardstown.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Tony O'Hehir"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: horse racing news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Mouchoir in great shape and primed for big run","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Greater London","zipCode":"E14","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Tower Hamlets","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"RacingPost.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660525","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"36"},"name":"RacingPost.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["HorseRacing","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.racingpost.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204828264","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:32:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.racingpost.com/2016/Dec/tb228937.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Their bare feet are covered in mud and their faces drip with sweat as they head to the asbestos shacks they call home. The visibly exhausted women say each family's water haul is capped at 40 liters, regardless of the family's size - \n\na rule enforced by a local police officer. \n\nThokozile Sibanda, 54, has lived in Ngozi Mine for 13 years, since she became homeless. She says she wakes up as early as 4 a.m. to fetch water. By 8 a.m., the queue for water is long, and sometimes there's none left for latecomers. Sibanda's early morning trek is filled with fear, as she worries about being mugged on her way to the water source. \n\n\"I have stayed at this slum for a very long time, and I must admit life is very hard and miserable for me and my family,\" she says, holding back tears. \"The struggles I have faced in accessing water are not only numberless, but disheartening and strenuous.\" \n\nThokozile Sibanda, 54, rests after walking about 1 kilometer to fetch water. She says she wakes up as early as 4 a.m. to begin the trek to the public tap. \n\nLinda Chinobva, GPJ Zimbabwe \n\nThe scarcity of water in the slum has contributed to her two grandchildren's diarrhea, Sibanda says. \n\n\"As much as we want to keep our environment clean, we are limited by the unavailability of water because we have to conserve the little that we get, and in the process we are subjected to different illnesses that are left untreated,\" she says. \n\nFour hundred people live at Ngozi Mine, according to local estimates. Those people literally scrounge for food and other needs. Basic amenities don't reach the slums, most of which are illegal settlements, in the zones at the margins of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second-largest city. \n\nThe illegal settlement at Ngozi Mine is more than 15 years old, according to some residents. It cropped up as Zimbabwe's dire economic situation forced numerous people to move to the city's fringes and set up homes there, often due to a lack of job opportunities. Some residents were born there. \n\nHomes there are temporary structures built from corrugated zinc, asbestos and even plastics. They are susceptible to harsh weather conditions. \n\nResidents say they once fetched water from a nearby dam that was on private land, but in 2013 the owner of the farm on which that dam stood banned people from taking water, a measure meant to conserve the precious liquid for his farming activities. \n\nIn 2012, the city council introduced bowsers - \n\nwater tankers - \n\nwhich then became a clean water source for the slum dwellers. The bowser would deliver water at the slum once a week, and the slum dwellers were required to pay a $1 fee for 40 liters per family. The bowsers supplied the slum dwellers with clean water for two years, but in 2014 financial constraints ended that program. \n\nGideon Tshuma, an informal representative known as the resident chairman of the Ngozi Mine slum dwellers community, says water shortages are causing disharmony among the slum dwellers and neighboring communities, because Ngozi Mine residents take water from a stream in Cowdray Park, a nearby suburb, as an alternative to the city council tap. \n\nNgozi Mine residents acknowledge that they fetch stream water. Forty liters from the city tap isn't enough, says Patricia Ndiweni, a 15-year resident of Ngozi Mine. \n\n\"As a result, my family has resorted to fetching water from an unpurified stream,\" she says. \n\nThe stream gurgles with brown water.

Photo by Backpagepix  ~  \n  \nT  HE Confederation of African Football (Caf) is milking some of the poorest continental countries. \n \nIt is time the federation change its selection criteria, as far as Afcon hosts are concerned. They should stop picking countries, based on whether they\u2019ll benefit financially from the tournament. \n \nIt\u2019s great and honourable to host such a big event, with guests coming from the continent \u2013 and even as far away as Europe \u2013 to support Africa\u2019s premier tournament. \n \nBut when the tournament ends, poorer states are left to pick up the pieces \u2013 with nothing to show for it from Caf. \n \nYou see, when Caf awards hosting rights to a country, they expect it to have a Local Organising Committee (LOC) that will include members from the football federation and government to get commitment from all relevant parties. \n \nWell, this is also what Fifa requires before going ahead with permission to award a hosting rights certificate. \n \nBut the difference is Caf expects the host nation to renovate stadiums (if not build new ones), upgrade airports and road infrastructure using that nation\u2019s money. \n \nThis is good for the citizens of that country because they wouldn\u2019t have had their roads and airports renovated, and business booms for hotels. \n \nAll this aside, it left a bitter taste in my mouth when we arrived in Gabon, landing at the Leon M\u2019ba International Airport in Libreville, to be surrounded by abject poverty, more now than in 2012. \n \nOur short drive to the Chinese-owned Latoille Hotel was an eye-opener to how opposition parties in the country had made a valid point by calling for the boycott of the competition \u2013 to prevent from taking place in their country. \n \nGabon is still in a bad state, and their currency (Xaf) has collapsed to its lowest levels. \nBut President Ali Bongo Ondimba insisted on continuing with the competition. \n \nSome locals even told this reporter that Gabon would benefit nothing from Afcon proceeds. \n \nThey say Asians in the country are the ones making money because they own hotels and taxis to transport tourists across cities. \n \nAnd this was a valid point, as I didn\u2019t see any need to build the Stade de Port-Gentil in the outskirts of town \u2013 some 25km away from under-resourced masses. \n \nI wonder whose decision was it to abandon the 100 unfinished houses built around the stadium. \n \nThere was the Stade de l-Amitie in Libreville, which was renovated after being first built during the 2012 Afcon, when Gabon co-hosted the tournament with Equatorial Guinea, another poor state. \n \nUnlike the Fifa World Cup, Afcon doesn\u2019t come as a catalyst for new and improved facilities to support development of the game. \n \nThat\u2019s because Fifa donates money to the host nation and helps monitor development of the game in the country. \n \nRemember, Fifa helped Safa with money before the 2010 World Cup to build its headquarters? \n \nBut I guarantee you foreign nationals will be the ones to reap the rewards from the 2017 Afcon tournament in Gabon. \n \nThis, as their companies own hotels, their contractors built new stadiums and upgraded existing ones \u2013 and they are the ones who also own shops in the city. \n \nThe only benefit for the Gabonese population will only be their employment salary. \n \nBut Ali Bongo\u2019s government is the beneficiary of these partnerships, greater commercial activity and investment from sponsors, broadcasters and big companies. \n \nI can go on and on with how Issa Hayatou\u2019s Caf is reaping from the poorer companies. \n \nI wonder, who will use all the stadiums built in Gabon, especially the one with a hotel at the Stade de \nPort-Gentil \u2013 and when will they host another big event? \n \nThis looks like a big chunk of money just down the drain!","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"CAF IN IT FOR MONEY","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dailysun.co.za","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"334318601","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"91"},"name":"Dailysun.co.za","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://dailysun.mobi"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204857235","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:32:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said.

The detentions sparked protests outside many international airports, including John F. Kennedy Airport in New York and Dulles Airport outside Washington. \n\nU.S. District Court Judge Ann Donnelly issued her injunction over the government\u2019s objection during an emergency hearing Saturday night as several hundred people opposed to Trump\u2019s order chanted and milled about outside the Brooklyn, N.Y., federal courthouse. \n\nDuring the brief court session, the judge said it was difficult to see the harm in allowing the newly arrived immigrants to stay since they were being routinely admitted just a couple of days ago. \n\n\u201cIf they had come in two days ago, we wouldn\u2019t be here, am I right? \u2026 These are all people who have been through a vetting process,\u201d the judge said. \n\n\u201cExplain to me how these petitioners won\u2019t suffer irreparable damage if I don\u2019t grant this stay?\u201d Donnelly asked. \n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Susan Riley complained that the court proceeding was unduly rushed. \u201cThis has unfolded with such speed, we haven\u2019t had an opportunity to address any of the important legal issues,\u201d Riley said. \n\nHowever, American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Lee Gelernt said the immigrants affected were essentially the victims of bad timing that caused them to be caught in limbo just as Trump\u2019s order was being issued. \n\n\u201cThese people were caught in transit,\u201d Gelernt said. \u201cThe government is putting someone back on a plane to Syria now.\u201d \n\nDonnelly, an appointee of President Barack Obama, said she was freezing the status quo by blocking the deportations. \n\n\u201cThe whole point of this hearing is to preserve the status quo. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unduly burdensome to identify people we are talking about here,\u201d the judge declared. \u201cNobody is to be removed in this class.\u201d \n\nThe White House had no immediate comment on the legal setback for one of the new president\u2019s signature policy moves. Justice Department spokespeople did not immediately indicate whether an appeal was planned. \n\nDonnelly\u2019s order does not appear to interfere with most of Trump\u2019s directive, since the judge only moved to protect a limited number of individuals who were already on or were about to board flights to the U.S. when Trump signed his measure. Now, such travelers will likely be blocked from boarding flights in the first place. \n\nTwo other judges also stepped into the legal fray over the implementation of Trump\u2019s executive order Saturday night. A federal judge in Alexandria, Va., issued an order barring the deportation of all green card holders being detained at Dulles Airport for 7 days. Judge Leonie Brinkema\u2019s order also required that Customs and Border Protection grant lawyers access to those individuals. \n\n\u201cDepartment of Homeland Security officials are refusing to allow lawyers to talk with the detained people, who are legal permanent residents, even though the judge\u2019s order requires the government to permit lawyer access,\u201d one of the attorneys involved, Andrew Pincus, said later Saturday night. \n\nIn addition, a federal judge in Seattle blocked the deportation of two immigrants from the airport there until a hearing set for Friday. \n\nThe legal battle is now expected to move to a series of individual cases filed in New York, Chicago and elsewhere Saturday, where immigrants will be seeking to be released from detention to travel or settle in the U.S. \n\nDonnelly acted on a petition filed early Saturday, seeking to release Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi from detention at JFK Airport. The case was filed by the ACLU, the International Refugee Assistance Project the National Immigration Law Center and a Yale Law School legal clinic. \n\nDarweesh was released early Saturday afternoon, according to aides to New York Democratic Reps. Jerry Nadler and Nydia Velazquez, who went to JFK to try and free the men. Alshawi was released Saturday night, said a Nadler spokesman who indicated earlier that at least 10 others had been detained at the airport. \n\n\u201cWe are pleased to announce that Hameed Khalid Darweesh has been released and can now be reunited with his family,\u201d the two lawmakers said in a statement earlier Saturday. \u201cThis should not happen in America. We shouldn\u2019t have to demand the release of refugees one by one. We must fight this executive order in the streets, in the courts, anywhere, anytime. We must resist. We must fight. We must keep working to keep America the land of the free and the home of the brave.\u201d \n\nPandemonium over Trump\u2019s new executive order erupted at airports nationwide on Saturday, with reports of dozens of immigrants and travelers stranded or turned back in Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., New York and Dallas as demonstrators flooded airports to denounce Trump\u2019s directive. One Syrian Christian family who had been working with Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) were detained at Philadelphia International Airport and then subsequently forced to leave, according to the congressman. \n\nDuring a press conference at Dulles International Airport, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said one family had been detained as he slammed Trump\u2019s order as one that will \u201cbreed hatred toward Americans around the globe.\u201d Fifty people were being held at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, according to local reports. \n\nBut at the White House, Trump said his order was being carried out just as he planned. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over.\u201d \n\nCustoms and Border Protection agents who detained the men at JFK are pointing to Trump\u2019s executive order, telling the immigrants\u2019 attorneys: \u201cMr. President. Call Mr. Trump,\u201d according to the 20-page lawsuit. which was also filed by the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School and the American Civil Liberties Union. \n\nDarweesh, now 53, worked on behalf of the U.S. military in Iraq for a decade as an interpreter and electrical engineer, earning him a so-called \u201cspecial immigrant visa\u201d that are allotted to Iraqi nationals who aided the U.S. government during the Iraq War and now face threats staying there. Darweesh applied for the visa in Oct. 1, 2014, which was issued on Jan. 20, the same day Trump was inaugurated. \n\nAnd Alshawi, 33, was granted a visa Jan. 11 to join his wife and son, who have already been resettled as refugees in Houston. \n\nThe lawsuit argues that the detention of two men is \u201cpart of a widespread pattern applied to many refugees and arriving aliens detained after the issuance of\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order on Friday. \n\nOn a call with reporters Saturday, Abed Ayoub, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said CBP officials had told advocates dozens of people were being held at JFK as a result of the executive order. \n\nHe also cited reports of people being held at airports in Atlanta, Detroit, Houston and Washington, D.C. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already hearing about hundreds of people being detained at airports,\u201d said Marielena Hincapie, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. \u201cIt got issued late on a Friday afternoon, it was not released to the public for several hours and then here on a Friday night over the weekend, we\u2019re dealing with hundreds of people who have been arriving with no guidance to Border Patrol personnel.\u201d \n\nTrump\u2019s far-reaching executive order does allow for some exemptions at the discretion of administration officials, including \u201cwhen the person is already in transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship.\u201d But advocates such as Hincapie say the messy rollout of Trump\u2019s controversial directive is triggering confusion and chaos at airports nationwide, since border patrol officers have received little guidance on how to implement the order. \n\n\u201cThey failed to inform airports about what to do,\u201d Hincapie said. \n\nDarweesh\u2019s wife and three children were also granted visas and traveled with him, but were not detained. They are supposed to resettle in Charlotte, N.C. And neither men had been allowed to contact their lawyers, the lawsuit says. \n\nIraq is one of seven countries whose citizens, under Trump\u2019s executive order released late Friday, are barred from entering the United States for 90 days, along with Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n\nThe lawsuit, which alleges violation of Fifth Amendment rights for Darweesh and Alshawi, calls for the two men to be released and also asks a judge to issue an injunction asking the government not to detain any person just on the basis of Trump\u2019s executive order. Lawyers are asking to broaden the lawsuit to a larger class of people who are facing similar issues trying to enter the United States. \n\n\u201cEach of these similarly situated individuals has been detained and questioned by CBP officials, denied entry to the United States, and subject to the threat of return to the country from which their travel originated,\u201d the lawsuit claimed. \n\nSpokespeople for the Justice Department and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Brooklyn, as well as the White House, Department of Homeland Security, and Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the suit. The lawsuit was filed in the Eastern District of New York. \n\nTed Hesson and Josh Gerstein contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Seung Min Kim"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"Judge blocks deportations as Trump order sparks global outrage","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Western Europe","countryCode":"BE","country":"Belgium"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Politico.eu","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"536665488","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1676"},"name":"Politico.eu","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.politico.eu"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204859937","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:32:31Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Their bare feet are covered in mud and their faces drip with sweat as they head to the asbestos shacks they call home. The visibly exhausted women say each family's water haul is capped at 40 liters, regardless of the family's size - \n\na rule enforced by a local police officer. \n\nThokozile Sibanda, 54, has lived in Ngozi Mine for 13 years, since she became homeless. She says she wakes up as early as 4 a.m. to fetch water. By 8 a.m., the queue for water is long, and sometimes there's none left for latecomers. Sibanda's early morning trek is filled with fear, as she worries about being mugged on her way to the water source. \n\n\"I have stayed at this slum for a very long time, and I must admit life is very hard and miserable for me and my family,\" she says, holding back tears. \"The struggles I have faced in accessing water are not only numberless, but disheartening and strenuous.\" \n\nThokozile Sibanda, 54, rests after walking about 1 kilometer to fetch water. She says she wakes up as early as 4 a.m. to begin the trek to the public tap. \n\nLinda Chinobva, GPJ Zimbabwe \n\nThe scarcity of water in the slum has contributed to her two grandchildren's diarrhea, Sibanda says. \n\n\"As much as we want to keep our environment clean, we are limited by the unavailability of water because we have to conserve the little that we get, and in the process we are subjected to different illnesses that are left untreated,\" she says. \n\nFour hundred people live at Ngozi Mine, according to local estimates. Those people literally scrounge for food and other needs. Basic amenities don't reach the slums, most of which are illegal settlements, in the zones at the margins of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second-largest city. \n\nThe illegal settlement at Ngozi Mine is more than 15 years old, according to some residents. It cropped up as Zimbabwe's dire economic situation forced numerous people to move to the city's fringes and set up homes there, often due to a lack of job opportunities. Some residents were born there. \n\nHomes there are temporary structures built from corrugated zinc, asbestos and even plastics. They are susceptible to harsh weather conditions. \n\nResidents say they once fetched water from a nearby dam that was on private land, but in 2013 the owner of the farm on which that dam stood banned people from taking water, a measure meant to conserve the precious liquid for his farming activities. \n\nIn 2012, the city council introduced bowsers - \n\nwater tankers - \n\nwhich then became a clean water source for the slum dwellers. The bowser would deliver water at the slum once a week, and the slum dwellers were required to pay a $1 fee for 40 liters per family. The bowsers supplied the slum dwellers with clean water for two years, but in 2014 financial constraints ended that program. \n\nGideon Tshuma, an informal representative known as the resident chairman of the Ngozi Mine slum dwellers community, says water shortages are causing disharmony among the slum dwellers and neighboring communities, because Ngozi Mine residents take water from a stream in Cowdray Park, a nearby suburb, as an alternative to the city council tap. \n\nNgozi Mine residents acknowledge that they fetch stream water. Forty liters from the city tap isn't enough, says Patricia Ndiweni, a 15-year resident of Ngozi Mine. \n\n\"As a result, my family has resorted to fetching water from an unpurified stream,\" she says. \n\nThe stream gurgles with brown water. Empty bottles and plastic bags float on its surface, and a stench pervades the area. \n\nWard Councilor Collert Ndlovu, responsible for the slum area and neighboring suburbs, says he was not aware that the city council had stopped providing water to the slums. \n\n\"I am aware that there have been serious water issues at the slums. In the past, I have engaged the local authority to avail a tap for the slums so that they access clean water, and that is when the bowser was introduced,\" he says. \n\nBut he says he didn't know that the bowser had stopped delivering water. \n\n\"The challenge we have with the slums is that they are illegal settlers, so their plights are overlooked,\" he says. \n\nNdlovu says he plans to engage the council on the issue at its weekly meetings. \n\nStephan Sibanda has lived at the slum for five years. He says water scarcity is a challenge for him and his eight family members. \n\nThe 40 liters the family is allowed to take from the city tap have to stretch far enough so they can bathe, cook, drink and wash clothes. \n\n\"The water runs out before we accomplish all these,\" he says. \n\nLinda Chinobva, GPJ, translated some interviews from Ndebele.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Police news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Crime and punishment news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cop shot after chasing stolen car that skipped red light","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","countryCode":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"ZimbabweStar.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608213529","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"ZimbabweStar.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://feeds.zimbabwestar.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204867054","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T15:01:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:32:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued for a temporary stay that allowed detained travellers to stay in the United States. \n  \nSupporters outside the Brooklyn courtroom and at protests at airports in Dallas, Chicago, New York and elsewhere cheered the decision, but a bigger fight lay ahead. \n  \nThe court action does not reverse Trump's order, which was criticized by some of America's closest allies. \n  \nTrump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. \n  \nHe told reporters in the White House's Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \"not a Muslim ban\" and said the measures were long overdue. \n  \n\"It's working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\" Trump said. \n  \nAlong with Syria, the ban affects travellers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n  \nThe Department of Homeland Security said about 375 travellers had been affected by the order, 109 of whom were in transit and were denied entry to the United States. Another 173 were stopped by airlines before boarding. \n  \nThe order \"affects a minor portion of international travellers,\" the department said in a statement, saying the measures \"inconvenienced\" less than 1 percent of travellers.  \n  \nThe new rules blindsided people in transit and families waiting for them, and caused havoc for businesses with employees holding passports from the targeted nations and colleges with international students. \n  \nPegah Rahmani, 25, waited at Washington's Dulles airport for several hours for her grandparents, both Iranian citizens with U.S. green cards. \"They weren't treating them very well,\" she said. \n  \nRahmani's grandfather is 88 and legally blind. Her grandmother is 83 and recently had a stroke. They were released to loud cheers and cries. \n  \n'TIP OF THE SPEAR' \n  \nSeveral Democratic governors said they were examining whether they could launch legal challenges, and other groups eyed a constitutional challenge claiming religious discrimination. \n  \n\"I don't think anyone is going to take this lying down,\" said Cleveland immigration lawyer David Leopold. \"This is the tip of the spear and more litigation is coming.\" \n  \nThe White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment. \n  \nThe Department of Homeland Security said the order would stay in place. \n  \n\"No foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States,\" the department statement said. \n  \nMark Krikorian, the director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, called lawsuits challenging the order \"last ditch efforts\" that would only apply to a few individuals, and he said a broader constitutional argument would be hard to win. \n  \n\"The first amendment doesn't apply to foreigners living abroad. The law explicitly says the president can exclude any person or class of people he wants,\" Krikorian said. \n  \nSome leaders from the U.S. technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, issued warnings to their staff and called the order immoral and un-American. \n  \n\"This ban will impact many innocent people,\" said Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc UBER.UL, who said he would raise the issue at a White House meeting on Friday. \n  \nArab travellers in the Middle East and North Africa said the order was humiliating and discriminatory. Iran vowed to retaliate. \n  \nSudan called the action \"very unfortunate\" after Washington lifted sanctions on the country just weeks ago for cooperation on combating terrorism. A Yemeni official expressed dismay at the ban. \n  \nIraq's former ambassador to the United States, Lukman Faily, told Reuters that Trump's ban was unfair to a country that itself has been a victim of terror attacks, and could backfire. \n  \n\"We have a strong partnership with U.S., more so in the urgent fight against terrorism. This ban move will not help, and people will start questioning the bond of this partnership, Faily said. \n  \nAllies in the United Kingdom, France and Germany were critical. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted a photo of himself welcoming Syrian refugees. \n  \nGREEN CARD CONFUSION \n  \nConfusion abounded at airports as immigration and customs officials struggled to interpret the new rules. Some legal residents with green cards who were in the air when the order was issued were detained at airports upon arrival. \n  \nHowever, senior administration officials said it would have been \"reckless\" to broadcast details of the order in advance. \n  \nOther officials said green card holders from the affected countries would require extra screening and would be cleared on a case-by-case basis. \n  \nAirlines were blindsided and some cabin crew were barred from entering the country. \n  \nTravellers were handled differently at different points of entry and immigration lawyers advised clients to change their destination to the more lenient airports, said Houston immigration lawyer Mana Yegani. \n  \nAt Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport, brothers Bardia and Ayden Noohi waited for four hours for their father Kasra Noohi - who has an Iranian passport and a U.S. green card - to be allowed through. \n  \nThey knew Trump had pledged tougher rules but did not expect the problems. \"I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d actually do it,\" Bardia Noohi, 32, said. \"A lot of politicians just talk.\" \n  \nThousands of refugees seeking entry were thrown into limbo. Melanie Nezer of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society said she knew of roughly 2,000 who were booked to come to the United States next week. \n  \nTrump's order indefinitely bans refugees from Syria. In a television interview, he said he would seek to prioritize Christian refugees fleeing the war-torn country. \n  \nU.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were not consulted on the action and in some cases only learned the details as they were made public. \n  \nAt the State Department, a senior official said lawyers were working to interpret the executive order, which allows entry to people affected by the order when it is in the \"national interest.\" \n  \nHowever, a federal law enforcement official said: \"It's unclear at this point what the threshold of national interest is.\" \n  \n(Reporting by Yara Bayoumy, Jeff Mason, Roberta Rampton, Doina Chiacu, Lesley Wroughton, Yeganeh Torbati in Washington; Mica Rosenberg, Jonathan Allen, Melissa Fares, Daniel Trotta and David Ingram in New York; Robert Chiarito in Chicago; Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Lisa Maria Garza in Dallas; Alissa Greenberg, Joseph Menn, Julia Love and Kristina Cook in San Francisco; Jeffrey Dastin in Redwood City, California; Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Khalid Abdelaziz in Khartoum; Parisa Hafezi in Dubai; Andrea Hopkins, Anna Mehler Paperny in Toronto; Writing by Doina Chiacu and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Grant Mary Milliken, Bill Rigby and Paul Tait) \n  Next In World News     Putin and Trump agree to try to rebuild U.S.-Russia ties, cooperate in Syria  \nMOSCOW Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to try to rebuild U.S. Russia ties and to cooperate in Syria, the Kremlin said on Saturday, after the two men spoke for the first time since Trump's inauguration. \n    Trump bars door to refugees, visitors from seven mainly Muslim nations  \nWASHINGTON/CAIRO Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an EgyptAir flight from Cairo to New York on Saturday after President Donald Trump halted the entry of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, sources at Cairo airport said. \n    In Turkey visit, May pushes trade, mentions human rights  \nANKARA British Prime Minister Theresa May signed a $125 million (£100 million) fighter jet deal with Turkey on Saturday and briefly cautioned Ankara on human rights following last year's failed coup, in a visit squarely aimed at boosting trade between the NATO allies.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Turkey news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"RPT-WRAPUP 6-Chaos, anger as Trump order halts some Muslim immigrants","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Reuters UK","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587711","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"266"},"name":"Reuters UK","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Materials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://uk.reuters.com/","publisher":"Thomson Reuters"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204871601","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:32:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It\u2019s obviously a very tricky part of roster construction.\u201d \n \nFriedman joked that the seasons when he was most worried about the bullpen usually turned out to be the years when his bullpen performed best \u2014 and vice versa. \n \nEven if an \u2018under construction\u2019 sign remains permanently fixed to any bullpen in Friedman\u2019s mind, the Dodgers\u2019 current relief corps looks to be largely settled with spring training just over two weeks away. \n \nGeneral manager Farhan Zaidi offered that there are \u201csome interesting guys still out there\u201d on the free agent market. But the relievers in that group \u2014 veterans like Joe Smith, Fernando Salas and Sergio Romo \u2014 appear to hold little interest for the Dodgers. Veteran Joe Blanton (who surprisingly emerged as the Dodgers\u2019 most reliable setup man last season) remains unsigned as well and \u201cit\u2019s not lost on us what a significant part of our bullpen he was last season,\u201d Friedman said. \n \nBut that successful 2016 (a 2.48 ERA and 1.01 WHIP in a team-high 75 appearances) might have pushed the 36-year-old Blanton\u2019s market beyond what the Dodgers are willing to pay after extending themselves farther than expected (a combined $192 million) to re-sign Jansen, Turner and Hill. The same financial restraint has probably kept the Dodgers from bidding aggressively for other bullpen options. \n \n\u201cObviously we committed significant resources (to re-signing their in-house free agents),\u201d Friedman said. \u201cI think it impacts everywhere, just how you allocate. It obviously has trickle-down effects.\u201d \n \nZaidi pointed out that the Dodgers\u2019 bullpen performed \u201cat the top of baseball\u201d last year and can look forward to full seasons from players like Josh Fields and Grant Dayton who emerged as key pieces late in the year. The only additions to last year\u2019s group figure to be of the type already signed \u2014 former Tampa Bay Ray Steve Geltz and former San Diego Padre Brandon Morrow both of whom signed minor-league contracts with non-roster invitations to spring training. \n \n\u201cI think the arms are there,\u201d said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts who made a major-league record 606 pitching changes in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a situation where somebody\u2019s gotta emerge, sort of what Joe Blanton did for us last year. \n \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of options. It\u2019s more about who\u2019s going to step up and pitch those innings.\u201d \n Weighty matters  \nOutfielder Yasiel Puig lifted his shirt onstage to show the crowd at Dodger Stadium for Saturday\u2019s FanFest how well he is doing in satisfying the Dodgers\u2019 request for him to get leaner in 2017. Puig has hired a nutritionist and a chef, Roberts said \u2013 though they didn\u2019t appear to be part of the entourage throwing \u2018YP\u2019 logo hats to the crowd as Puig made his FanFest appearance. \n \nCatcher Yasmani Grandal, meanwhile, has cut meat from his diet this winter and expects to report to spring training 10 pounds below his usual playing weight and 20 pounds lower than he normally starts spring training. Grandal said he is \u201ca little worried\u201d about being too light and will probably add meat back into his diet this spring. \n \nFitness and diet aren\u2019t the only issues for Puig this season as he tries to bounce back from a disappointing 2016 that included a month-long demotion to Triple-A and serial attempts by the Dodgers to trade him. \n \n\u201cIt was not a good experience going to Triple-A,\u201d Puig said, conducting his interview in English. \u201cBut that was my fault \u2013 coming in late, not going to meetings on time with my teammates and coaches. That was the reason.\u201d \n \nRoberts said he has spoken with Puig multiple times during the winter and \u201che\u2019s in a great state of mind right now.\u201d \n Notes  \nUtilityman Kiké Hernandez plans to play for Puerto Rico in the World Baseball Classic. Outfielder Joc Pederson, however, said he turned down an invitation to play for Team Israel. As a minor leaguer four years ago, Pederson was the youngest player on Team Israel during the qualifying rounds for the WBC. ... Roberts said 20-year-old left-hander Julio Urias will definitely have an innings limit in 2017 \u2014 \u201che is still a young man.\u201d Roberts has mentioned the possibility that Urias will stay behind in Arizona for extended spring training after the Dodgers break camp as a way to save those innings for later in the year. \u201cIt\u2019s a team decision,\u201d Urias said through an interpreter. \u201cI\u2019m just going to get ready and wait for their decision. I\u2019ll respect it whatever it is.\u201d \u2026 Friedman said he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about reports that Hyun-Jin Ryu has already been throwing off a mound. If Ryu can make a comeback from shoulder and elbow surgeries that limited him to one start in the past two years \u201cit would be a real boon to us,\u201d Friedman said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Bill Plunkett"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dodgers' bullpen seems settled, but it doesn't mean team isn't still looking","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"91790","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"West Covina","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"SGV Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169699559","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"name":"SGV Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sgvtribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204879838","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T03:56:36Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:32:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://image.sgvtribune.com/storyimage/LC/20170128/SPORTS/170129399/AR/0/AR-170129399.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

When the first (three) went in, I got into a rhythm. I think I had a little more confidence than I normally would.\u201d \n \nMichael Lindauer hit Combs on a backdoor alley-oop to boost the Tigers\u2019 lead to 41-20 with 3:23 left in the first half. On nearly an identical play, Logan Douglas found Combs for a backdoor alley-oop, to increase their margin to 46-23 with 2:02 showing. \n \nDylan Penn complemented Combs with 24 points, going 10-for-12 from the stripe in a game plagued by fouls. After a tough 55-52 loss at Princeton on Friday, the Tigers rebounded nicely, improving to 9-7 overall and 1-3 in the Southern Indiana Athletic Conference. \n \n\u201cPrinceton is a very good basketball team,\u201d said Memorial coach Rick Wilgus. \u201cEverybody looks at their record (7-10) and think Memorial laid an egg. They\u2019re a good team. We were down eight and had a chance to win. We carried that over into tonight against a good Mater Dei team. They compete. They keep coming at you.\u201d \n \nSam Fulton scored 19 points and had six rebounds for Mater Dei (8-8, 0-4). \n \nCombs\u2019 3-pointer from the right wing and two free throws began a 14-1 surge that boosted the Tigers\u2019 advantage to 27-13 with 7:34 left in the second period. Memorial appeared on the verge of a blowout win, but the Wildcats doggedly hung in there. Jules Weinzapfel hit a pair of foul shots to narrow the margin to 73-59 with 1:51 remaining in the game, but they could never close within single digits. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a nice team,\u201d Mater Dei coach Kurt Wildeman said of Memorial. \u201cThey played well and shot it. We let it get away (late in the first quarter).\u201d \n \nThe Tigers finished 22-for-39 from the field, a 56.4 percentage, and were 28-for-38 from the line. \n \n\u201cWe kept battling,\u201d Wildeman said. \u201cThe second half was all right. We played hard all the way. We have to work hard in practice to get better.\u201d \n \nCombs had 22 of his game-high point total in the first half. \n \n\u201cBranson plays hard,\u201d Wilgus said. \u201cHe\u2019s fun to watch when he\u2019s fundamental.

About 11,000 fans packed into Indiana State Fairgrounds Coliseum for the game, cheering and hollering the entire time. \n \nExcept there was Tinkham, who co-founded both the ABA and the Pacers franchise, watching more nervously than everyone else because he knew a secret: The Pacers were a day-to-day operation with no long-term existence guaranteed. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019d raised some money, we\u2019d spent the money, and we realized we had to go pretty far in the playoffs to continue to operate because the team, early on, was not a raving investment vehicle for people,\u201d Tinkham said. \u201cI\u2019m sitting there realizing, \u2018What happens (if we lose)?  We don\u2019t have a plan. You end on a playoff loss, who wants it?\u2019 We honestly didn\u2019t have a long-range plan at that point. We just figured we had to win.\u201d \n \nBob Netolicky, an ABA Pacers great, didn\u2019t know the consequences of the game as a 26-year-old ballplayer out of Drake. He remembers Game 7 fondly for scoring 32 points and grabbing 16 rebounds, pushing the Pacers to their first-ever playoff series victory. \n \nBut he didn't know that a loss might have meant the end of the Pacers. \n \n\u201cI think, 'Thank God we didn\u2019t know what was on the line,' because I don\u2019t know if it would have affected the players or not,\u201d Netolicky said, adding: \u201cIf we lost that game, which we were supposed (to do), the Pacers would fold.\u201d \n \nPerhaps less surprising now that the Pacers are celebrating their 50th season as a franchise \u2014 they were founded Feb. 2, 1967 as an original member of the ABA \u2014 the winning didn\u2019t stop after they beat the Colonels, 120-111, that night in 1969. \n \nThe Pacers eliminated the Miami Floridians 4-1 in the next round, then suffered a 4-1 series loss in the ABA finals to the Oakland Oaks. But they had saved the franchise. Indiana won its first championship the following season and reached the finals five times total, adding two more titles in its nine years in the ABA. \n \nBut nearly 48 years later, Tinkham and Netolicky still talk about the night the franchise won its first playoff series as the moment that changed everything for the organization. \n  \nDick Tinkham (1995 File Photo by Frank Espich), original owner of the Indiana Pacers  (Photo: FILE PHOTO) \n  \n\u201cThe defining moment was one in which we understood we had to win to stay in business,\u201d Tinkham said. \u201cBecause there were other owners in the league who had a lot more money than we had who weren\u2019t winning and they were folding. The box office was not giving them enough money to operate on.\u201d \n \nTinkham doesn\u2019t sugarcoat the early days. The way he tells it, on that day in February 1967 when the official announcement was made that Indianapolis would once again house a professional basketball team, none of the owners knew much about the basketball industry. \n \nNetolicky refers to the years in the late 1960s as the sport\u2019s \u201cdark ages,\u201d where \u201cthe NBA was about as popular as night bowling.\u201d \n \nIt was a different time, long before the days of superstars such as Paul George making roughly $240,000 per game. A single payday for George now would have covered the total salaries of all of the players from the first two years of the team, according to team salary records provided by Scott Tarter, a lawyer who runs Dropping Dimes, an ABA charity, and collects historical documents connected to the league. \n  \nScott Tarter, a lawyer who runs Dropping Dimes, an ABA charity, has numerous rare documents,letters, programs and other rare items from the early days of the Indiana Pacers. This is hand written sheet of the players salary and other operating expenses.  (Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar) \n   \nTo add further perspective: The NBA struck a nine-year, $24 billion media-rights deal with ESPN and Turner Sports in 2014. Local television carried Pacers games from the birth of the franchise,  generating around $2,500 in revenue. \n \nNevertheless, the Pacers compiled a roster oozing with talent \u2014 players such as Hall of Famers Mel Daniels and Roger Brown and Freddie Lewis \u2014 and won their first playoff series in their second year in the ABA. \n  \nPacers support Richard Lugar and the new stadium.

Frank Fisse/The Star Oct 8, 1971  (Photo: IndyStar) \n   \n\u201cThat\u2019s when really I think the city got behind us,\u201d Netolicky said. \u201cThat was the game that kind of turned it all around for the city.\u201d \n \nIn a way, the Pacers winning that Game 7 helped revitalize Downtown Indianapolis. \n \nThe city was just closing its last hotel Downtown when Richard Lugar became mayor in 1968. Hesaw the potential in talks between the Pacers and architects looking to build what would become Market Square Arena. \n \nTinkham said he contacted Marriott in hopes of putting a hotel close to the arena\u2019s originally proposed location near I-465, but Marriott\u2019s evaluation revealed a hotel location would be better suited for Downtown. That led the city to urge the Pacers to build their future home arena on East Market Street. \n \nThe addition of the arena helped Lugar\u2019s administration push the city\u2019s new identity as a \u201cGreat American City\u201d following Unigov, which consolidated the governments of the city and Marion County in 1970. \n \n\u201cHere we are 30 years later, we\u2019ve got the (Indianapolis) Colts,\u201d Netolicky said. \u201cWithout another ... pro franchise Downtown, you think the Colts would have even looked at Indianapolis?\u201d \n  \nABA Pacers photo by Jim Young The News. 3/25/1970 Pacers vs. Carolina.

No one understood at the time how important winning a game of basketball could be for the lives of millions. \n \nBut that night, Tinkham learned what it took to survive in basketball. \n \n\u201cWhat we found out as a result of that game was, and I hate to keep repeating myself, but you have to win,\u201d Tinkham said. \u2018You have to win in order to survive. That\u2019s what that game taught us.\u201d \n \nFollow IndyStar reporter Jordan J. Wilson on Twitter: @Wilsonable07. \n INDIANA PACERS vs. HOUSTON ROCKETS  \nTipoff: 6 p.m. Sunday, Bankers Life Fieldhouse. \n \nTV:  Fox Sports Indiana. \n \nRadio:  WFNI-AM (1070). \n \nStorylines: \n \n>> According to ESPN, Houston MVP candidate James Harden assisted on or scored a total of 80 points in the Rockets' 123-118 win Friday against Philadelphia. The Western Conference All-Star starter concluded that game with 51 points, 13 assists and 13 rebounds for his 14th triple-double of the season. Harden enters Sunday averaging 29.1 points, 11.6 assists and 8.3 rebounds per game, all career highs.  \n \n>> The Pacers (24-22) continue to look like a different team at home than they do on the road. Friday's win over the Kings at Bankers Life Fieldhouse pushes the Pacers home record to a robust 17-6. Meanwhile, they are 6-17 on the road while allowing opponents to score 8.2 more points per game (110.9) on the road that at home (102.7). \n \n>> Pacers coach Nate McMillan's decision to insert C.J. Miles into the starting lineup has paid dividends through three games. Not only are the Pacers 2-1, but Miles is +23 in game +/-, and he's averaged 12.3 points and 3.6 rebounds per game. He also has knocked down 11 of his 22 attempts from beyond the arc.  \n \n>> The Pacers have been successful at home, but there will be no climbing out of 16-point holes \u2014 like they did against the Kings \u2014 against Harden and the Rockets (35-15). If they have another lapse like they did in third quarter Friday, expect Houston to put them away.   Rockets 116, Pacers 106. \n \n\u2014 Jim Ayello","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Indiana Pacers news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NBA news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The game that saved the Pacers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Vanderburgh","zipCode":"47702","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Evansville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Evansville Courier","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668035","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1871"},"name":"Evansville Courier","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.courierpress.com/f"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204885692","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:32:41Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But then...  \nA lawyer for the district advised that the school was breaking the law by displaying the picture. \n \n\u201cWe were notified and we responded to stay in compliance,\u201d Proffitt said, according to the Wichita Eagle. \n   Popular Video  This inmate walked out of his cell and started viciously beating a guard. But then...   \nThe image was a print of a work painted by Warner Sallman, an evangelical Christian artist. But nobody seems to know precisely how long it has been in the school. \n \n\u201cI do know it\u2019s been decades,\u201d Proffitt said. \u201cSome people who went through the system before \u2013 30 to 40 years ago \u2013 knew it was hanging in the hallway back then. It was kind of a permanent fixture, if you will.\u201d \n \nThe FFRF argued that as a public institution, the middle school was not permitted to display religious symbols. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have people who appreciate the law and get things done (and) who follow the law even if it\u2019s likely to be unpopular in the community,\u201d Ryan Jayne of the FFRF said. \n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t consider any constitutional violation to be petty and not worth going after,\u201d Jayne added. \n \nSome local residents expressed their disagreement with the move. \n \nSamantha Barnhart, a former student at Royster Middle School, sai that non-Christian students always had the option of sitting out the pledge of allegiance or Christmas celebrations. \n \n\u201cIf you have the right to not participate, we have the right to keep our picture up,\u201d she told the Wichita Eagle. \u201cJust don\u2019t look at it.\u201d \n \nJayne countered that especially in communities where religion is a major factor, such as in Chanute where there are around 30 churches in a town of 9,000, religious symbols must be removed from public buildings to protect religious minorities and atheists. \n \nOtherwise, \u201c[t]hey are extremely likely to remain political outsiders,\u201d Jayne said. \n \nFFRF took up a similar case in Jackson, Ohio, last year, the Eagle reported. \n \nA school district was displaying the same Sallman print, but was forced to remove it and pay $95,000 in legal fees after FFRF and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit. \n \nSources:  Wichita Eagle ,  Fox News \n \nPhoto credit: Chanute School District via  Wichita Eagle , Warner Sallman via  Wikipedia","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Charles Roberts"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"This 30-Year-Old Picture Landed A School In Hot Water; Should It Be Removed?

Rowdy McLean, International keynote speaker, business and leadership consultant said being reactive is when you allow your life to unfold according to what shows up. \n \n\"Reactive is being a spectator in the game of life, reacting to whats going on from the sidelines. If you think about the four main areas of your life, Finances, career, health and relationships, are you just reacting to stuff. Bills to pay, boss is cranky, health isn't great, your partner doesn't care and your world unfolds according to these things,\" McLean told The Huffington Post Australia. \n \nBut being proactive is when you focus on the areas that need the most attention and choosing to be an active participant. \n \n\"Let's say, you hate your job. Rather than show up and complain about it, ask yourself, how can you, make it better? How can you have more fun, be more interesting and more interested? If you want to change jobs, what skills will you need and start working on getting them?\" Mclean said. \n \n\n laflor Teach yourself to be proactive instead of letting each day melt into the next. \n\"What needs to change so that you are the ideal employee in the job you want to work in? Now, learn to be that person, show up in that way, so that when the opportunity arrives you give it your absolute best shot.\" \n \nNikki Fogden-Moore, founder of the Vitality Road Map , told HuffPost Australia the biggest asset anyone can have in leadership is an open mind to keep learning, applying and looking ahead. \n \n\"Great leaders are agile, they are able to be healthy, avoid making stress induced decisions,think of the commercial potential and use their experience as wisdom on a weekly and daily basis. Most of all, they have an idea and clear goals on where they are going for both commercial and personal success. If you do not design the life you want you will get the one you're given,\" Fogden-Moore said. \n \n\"Life has no remote; you must get up and change it yourself. Kicking off the new year with a thoughtful and well orchestrated game plan is essential for clarity and conviction as well as getting others to buy into what needs to be done as well.\" \n \n\"My core tip to anyone is make sure you know your 'why' and set goals that tick all three of these boxes: is this goal relevant? Is this realistic? Is this goal real-time?\" \n \n\n  To be the ultimate leader in business and in life we need to be the navigator, not the passenger. \nSuccess coach Muffy Churches said it's not easy when each day melts into the next and we do our best to keep our head above water. \n \n\"There can be a sensation that, 'This life as we know it is the hand we've been dealt and we just need to buck-up and get on with it.' Each day then becomes a reaction to the external world, to the people and events in it, and in this scenario we play a helpless victim. Our mood, our energy and our creativity goes south over time and we become 'unhappily stagnant.' Churches said. \n \n\"The magic moment arrives though, when we realise that in fact we hold the control box to our life and have all the freedom in the world to choose our next move, our mood, our well-being and/or our career path. Getting clear about what we 'want' instead of what we've got, is the starting point.\" \n Muffy Churches Tips  Identify: Get clarity around what isn't working and needs to change (at work or at home)  Envision: Create a clear vision for what you want instead  Shift: Mindfully transform any unproductive emotions or thought patterns that are holding you ransom (Keeping you from acting on what you want)  Plan: Build a strategy for getting what you want  Act: Do something each day to move closer to making your vision a reality.

She heard about it on Twitter and thinks most people did the same. \n \nIn New York City, a large crowd massed at John F. Kennedy International Airport to protest the detention of two Iraqis who were later released. \n \n\u201cMr. President, look at us,\u201d said US Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat. \u201cThis is America. What you have done is shameful. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d \n \nThe protesters gathered in Terminal 4 at JFK and carried signs reading, \u201cWe are all immigrants!\u201d and \u201cNo ban! No wall!\u201d \n \nSeveral New York officials showed support for the protests. \n \nGov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reverse an earlier decision to restrict passage aboard the JFK Airport AirTrain to ticketed passengers and airport employees only. \n \nHe also instructed state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to assist with security and transportation for protesters. \n \n\u201cThe people of New York will have their voices heard,\u201d Cuomo said. \n \nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening at JFK is shameful. @NYCImmigrants Affairs Commissioner Nisha Agarwal is on the ground now working to help.\u201d \n \nOne of the detained Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was released early Saturday afternoon. He worked with the US government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. \n \nThe other detained Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for a US contractor in Iraq, and son, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees. Alshawi was released later Saturday. \n \nThe American Civil Liberties Union argued Saturday evening in a federal court in New York for a nationwide stay that would block the deportation of all people stranded in US airports under what the group called \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s new Muslim ban.\u201d \n \nA federal judge in New York granted an emergency stay Saturday night for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries who have already arrived in the US and those who are in transit, and who hold valid visas, ruling they cannot be removed from the US. \n \nThat move limited part of President Trump\u2019s executive order barring citizens from those countries from entering the US for the next 90 days. \n \nRep. Jerrold Nadler, another Democrat from New York, said 10 other travelers were detained, but their status was unclear Saturday night. \n \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe joined protesters at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. \n \n\u201cThis executive order is antithetical to the values that make America great, and it will make our country less safe,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \nIn Portland, one demonstrator carried a sign that said, \u201cPortland coffee comes from Yemen,\u201d one of the seven Muslim-majority nations on the no-travel list. \n \nLucia Martinez told KATU she used to be a \u201chashtag activist\u201d but felt compelled to protest at the airport. \n \n\u201cThis was the last straw,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cWe\u2019re all immigrants.\u201d \n \nA group of community activists, attorneys and others gathered at O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n \nProtests also took place at airports in Boston; San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and Newark, New Jersey. \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"More protests against Trump\u2019s immigration policies planned","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KMAJ 107.7 FM","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"505723435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"KMAJ 107.7 FM","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts","Music"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kmaj.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/us-immigration-protests/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695204898140","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:46:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:32:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale\u2019s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\u201cThe judge\u2019s order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US \u2014 it doesn\u2019t immediately order that they be released from detention,\u201d he told CNN. \n \n\u201cWe are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\u201d he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \u201cour courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\u201d \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \u201cpreserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\u201d \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump\u2019s controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump\u2019s order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \u201conly for nationals of countries for whom\u201d members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump\u2019s order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\u201cAmerica is the land of freedom,\u201d he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \u201cAmerica is the greatest nation.\u201d \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump\u2019s order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump\u2019s order and pledged continued action. \n \n\u201cThis should not happen in America,\u201d Velazquez said following Darweesh\u2019s release. \u201cOne by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\u201d \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\u201cBecause the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\u201d the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK\u2019s Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\u201cWhen Mr. Darweesh\u2019s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, \u2018Who is the person to talk to?\u2019 the CBP agents responded, \u2018Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\u201d the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\u201cOur courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump\u2019s order puts those who have helped us in harm\u2019s way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\u201d said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nTrump\u2019s executive order, titled \u201cProtection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\u201d makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\u201cI am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them here.\u201d \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of the president\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\u201cThe president\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security.\u201d \n \nClick here to read full story »","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KMAJ 107.7 FM","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"505723435","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"KMAJ 107.7 FM","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Arts","Music"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kmaj.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/ny-immigration-order-stay/index.html"],"sequenceId":"695204901748","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:14:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:32:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It was revealed that the pictures were taken in Heilongjiang Province. Military analysts believe that this is perhaps the second Dongfeng-41 strategic missile brigade and it should be deployed in northeastern China. \n \nAccording to reports, the Dongfeng-41 is a nuclear solid-fuel road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile. With a range of 14,000 kilometers and a payload of 10-12 nuclear warheads, it can target anywhere in the world and is widely considered one of the most advanced intercontinental ballistic missiles. \n \nThere has been constant speculation about the Dongfeng-41. Its deployment is classified at the highest military levels. But most military experts believe that China has finished the research and production of the Dongfeng-41 and the conditions for deployment are optimal. But there has been no authoritative information on whether China has a Dongfeng-41 strategic missile brigade, how many such brigades it has and where they are deployed. \n \nSome media claimed that the Chinese military intentionally revealed the Dongfeng-41 and connected it with the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. They think this is Beijing's response to Trump's provocative remarks on China. \n \nBefore Trump took power, his team showed a tough stance toward China, and in turn, Beijing will ready itself for pressures imposed by the new US government. It is logical that Beijing attaches particular importance to the Dongfeng-41 as a strategic deterrence tool. With China's rise, China's strategic risks are growing. China bears the heavy task of safeguarding national security. Nuclear deterrence is the foundation of China's national security, which must be consolidated with the rising strategic risks. \n \nThe US has the world's most powerful military strength, including the most advanced and powerful nuclear arsenal. But Trump has called for a nuclear arms build-up many times. Even Washington feels that its naval forces and nuclear strength are lacking, so how can China be content with its current nuclear strength when it is viewed by the US as its biggest potential opponent? \n \nChina's nuclear capability should be so strong that no country would dare launch a military showdown with China under any circumstance, and such that China can strike back against those militarily provoking it. A military clash with the US is the last thing China wants, but China's nuclear arsenal must be able to deter the US. \n \nThe US has not paid enough respect to China's military. Senior US officials of the Asia-Pacific command frequently show their intention to flex their muscles with arrogance. The Trump team also took a flippant attitude toward China's core interests after Trump's election win. Enhancing communication and mutual understanding is not enough. China must procure a level of strategic military strength that will force the US to respect it. \n \nA China with or without the Dongfeng-41 is different to the outside world. That is the significance of the Dongfeng-41. We hope this strategic edge will be revealed officially soon. It will not bring the China Threat theory, but will only add authority to the People's Liberation Army. \n \n  \n \n ","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Asia-Pacific latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Beijing news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"China news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Military news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Dongfeng-41 will bring China more respect","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Eastern Asia","countryCode":"CN","country":"China"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"China Military Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170713788","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"27"},"name":"China Military Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Industrials","AerospaceDefense"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://eng.chinamil.com.cn"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204906318","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:32:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They're mentally tough as well. They always kept going.\n\n\"It's something that I learned from them a lot, is how to hopefully do the same, which hopefully I've been able to do.\"\n\nWilliams had been reluctant to talk about records in Melbourne to keep the pressure off, but she is now ready to acknowledge her standing as one of the greatest women players of all time, if not the greatest.\n\n\"I definitely think so. I mean, between Martina, myself, Steffi Graf, hands down we are leading that conversation,\" she said.\n\nHer achievement took 19 long years from her Grand Slam debut as a 17-year-old in Melbourne in 1998, and she is not ready to stop just yet.\n\nBut she insists there are no new goals, despite Court's 24 titles being within reach. \"I never had a number. That's the beauty of it,\" she said.\n\n\"When I started this journey, I just wanted to win a Grand Slam. Then I just wanted to win. Every time I step on the court, I want to win.\"\n\nAnd in an ominous sign that there is still more to come, she added: \"I don't want it to stop. I want to keep it going.\"\n\nEnjoy the moment\n\nBeing at the top for so long means Williams now carefully selects her tournaments, and she is set to take a break now until Indian Wells in early March.\n\nShe said she wanted to enjoy winning in Australia, and give it time to sink in.\n\n\"One thing I learned in the past is you have to enjoy it. That's the beauty of winning Australia, you have a few months to relax,\" she said.\n\n\"If you win the French, it's like back-to-back-to-back-to-back. Australia, you have time to enjoy the moment before the next Grand Slam.\"\n\nWilliams also has wedding plans to make after her recent engagement to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who was courtside for her historic victory.\n\nShe revealed that elder sister Venus would be a bridesmaid, but not when the marriage would take place nor where. But she said it was special having Ohanian by her side in Melbourne.\n\n\"He's been so supportive in the stands. Although I never really heard him, even though I heard he was very boisterous,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm so focused, I don't hear a lot. I have really selective hearing. It's nice to have that support. It is a wonderful feeling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Fighting spirit propels Serena to greatness","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dotemirates.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"609646081","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Dotemirates.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dotemirates.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204914592","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:29:20Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:32:51Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://dotemirates.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/2017/01/bdf765418f945caa4c715787e101e460.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Often, Pochettino's side have lacked pace on the flanks and a direct runner to take on defenders, which is just what Zaha would bring. \n \n[embedded content] \n \nZaha would surely be seen as an upgrade on or alternative to Heung-min Son and Moussa Sissoko out wide, so here are some statistics from this season to show just whether Zaha would be an improvement on the current Spurs duo. \n    Team  Big Chances Created  Assists  Total Crosses  Accurate Crosses  Shots  Shots on target  Goals  Successful dribbles  Mins Played  Wilfried Zaha  C. Palace  22  6  59  18  24  10  4  80  1,644  Son Heung-Min  Tottenham  21  3  40  9  38  14  7  31  1,015  Moussa Sissoko  Tottenham  16  2  26  2  13  1  0  18  581  \nZaha has created more chances than both Son and Sissoko, but has played considerably more minutes, whilst he also comes out on top in terms of assists and total crosses, whilst 31% of his crosses have been accurate this season - better than Son's 23% and Sissoko's pitiful 8%. \n \nSon's ability in front of goal is clearly superior though, as he's had more shots, more shots on target and scored more goals than Zaha, whilst Sissoko is again lagging way behind here. \n \nThe successful dribbles column is particularly interesting though. If Spurs do land Zaha, he would be signed with the intention of taking defenders on with his pace and trickery, and he has more than shown that this season. \n \nWith 80 successful dribbles, he has more than double Son's record in this category, and more than both Son and Sissoko combined, meaning he could be ideal for a role on the right hand side of midfield, where he can provide the pace and drive that Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli don't necessarily bring. \n \nZaha is still improving his end product, but the stats suggest that he's the natural winger that Tottenham have been lacking at times, and whether it's this month or in the summer, he should be a player kept firmly on Pochettino's wish list. \n \nWould you like to see Spurs sign Zaha?","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Olly Dawes"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Crystal Palace news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: soccer news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Report: Spurs plotting new £25m bid for Premier League winger; better than Sissoko and Son?","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Here Is The City","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169708994","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Here Is The City","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hereisthecity.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/tottenham-hotspur-fc/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/wilfried-zaha/","https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/2729923/tottenham-25m-crystal-palace-wilfried-zaha/","http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37187179","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/premier-league/","http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/topic/crystal-palace-fc/"],"sequenceId":"695204931925","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:04Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/548/crystal_palaces_wilfried_zaha_416827.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Their entire life,\u201d says Kailani Miranda, SoHumane animal behavior supervisor. \u201cNever had blankets or anything.\u201d \n \nThe quality of life for canines Maverick, Renata, Hugo, Klaus, Bashful, Tommy, Darby and Petunia certainly has improved. They were recently rescued from the dog meat trade thriving in several Asian countries such as China, South Korea and Vietnam, according to the Animal Welfare Institute. \n \nThe AWI estimates millions of dogs are killed for food annually, typically kept in poor, unhygienic living conditions such as \u201ccramped rusty, cages stacked on top of each other\u201d as they wait, the website says. Many of the animals die from dehydration, disease, broken bones or suffocation. \n \nThe Thailand-based Soi Dog Foundation, which partnered with SoHumane for the rescue, has a primary mission of capturing stray dogs, then sterilizing and vaccinating them before release, a method of controlling overpopulation. \n \nBut the organization also operates a shelter and animal hospital, which takes in animals that have been abused or are unable to survive on their own because of age or illness. \n \n\u201cThey rehabilitate the dogs, bring them to their facility, get them ready to be adopted and then they adopt them out all over Canada and the United States,\u201d SoHumane director Karen Evans says. \n \nSoHumane got involved with the rescue at its annual Toast for Tails fundraiser event, where Ashland residents Jeff Rinkoff and Janis Rosenthal donated the airfare portion of a travel package that brought in $7,550 for the organization. The winning bidder, Las Vegas resident Heather Heath, was able to travel to Thailand, where the Soi Dog Foundation is based. \n \nHeath picked up and \u201cchaperoned\u201d the dogs back to the San Francisco airport, where SoHumane officials waited to greet the dogs and transport them back to the Rogue Valley. They arrived Saturday. \n \n\u201cThat was really exciting,\u201d Miranda says. \u201cThey spent way too long in those crates. The flight got canceled, and they had to stay an extra night, so to get them and get them safe and comfortable, it felt really good to be able to get them off the plane.\u201d \n \nMiranda said the animals are doing well. Some, like Maverick and Klaus, are more shy, while others, like Renata and Hugo, come right up to their cages, noses twitching and tongues lolling greedily for kisses. \n \n\u201cThey\u2019re a little bit nervous and scared, but most of them are very, very friendly,\u201d she says, adding they will be ready to adopt soon.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Agriculture news","group":"Industry"}],"title":"Dogs rescued from meat trade arrive in Oregon","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"97502","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Central Point","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bend Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668815","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2479"},"name":"Bend Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bendbulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204936623","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We came out flat and played from behind. I thought their energy level was better. We forced them into some turnovers in the first half. We only had one in the second.\u201d \n \nThe Buffaloes\u2019 defense forced the Ducks to settle for too many jump shots, and Oregon shot just 38 perfect from the field and 32 percent from long range while only getting to the line 16 times. \n \n\u201cOur ball movement was bad,\u201d Altman said. \u201cWe took 34 3s out of 57 shots.

Tattoos, turbans and beards are in. \n \nPolice departments, compelled by a hiring crisis and eager for a more diverse applicant pool, are relaxing traditional grooming standards and getting away from rules that used to require a uniformly clean-shaven, 1950s look. \n \nMore officers are on the job with tattoos, beards or religious head coverings like hijabs and turbans in place of \u2014 or tucked beneath \u2014 their blue caps. \n \n\u201cMy turban is a part of me,\u201d said Mandeep Singh, among 160 Sikhs in the New York City Police Department who last month were allowed to wear navy blue turbans in place of the standard-issue police caps. \u201cThis opens a gate for other potential candidates who felt they could not be a police officer because they would have to choose either the job or their faith.\u201d That followed a 2014 move by the St. Paul, Minnesota, police to create a special hijab for its first female Somali Muslim officer. \n \nMuslim NYPD officer Masood Syed, who grows a beard for religious reasons, was suspended for its length and sued his department last year over a rule requiring beards to be trimmed to within a millimeter of the skin. \n \nAs a result, the department changed the length to a half-inch and reinstated him. Syed\u2019s suit is still pending, though, because he said the length is arbitrary and it should be case by case, depending on the officer\u2019s needs. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s 2017,\u201d Syed said. \u201cThe police department is supposed to reflect the community that it\u2019s policing.\u201d \n \nMany departments say it\u2019s tougher to attract candidates to a physically demanding job that offers low pay and is under increasingly intense public scrutiny. That has led many to make a nod to shifting fashion trends, particularly among millennials, and ease longstanding bans on beards and visible tattoos. \n \nNew Orleans; Portland; Austin, Texas; and Pinellas Park, Florida, are among the departments that look the other way if a recruit comes in with visible tattoos. \n \n\u201cModern practice is colliding with dress codes,\u201d said Will Aitchison, an attorney who represents police unions during labor-related disputes. \u201cAnd what police departments really should be focused on is how the officer performs his or her job, as opposed to how they look.\u201d \n \nIn Kansas, state police did a public survey on whether officers should be allowed to have tattoos to help determine whether to change their policy after they couldn\u2019t fill about 100 trooper jobs. \n \nHalf of the nearly 20,000 respondents had tattoos themselves. Sixty-nine percent said the department shouldn\u2019t have a policy prohibiting visible tattoos. \n \n\u201cWe were surprised by the response,\u201d said Lt. Adam Winters. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem to bother people.\u201d \n \nStill, the department\u2019s prohibition on visible tattoos has stayed in place, in part because of the potential challenge of regulating the content of tattoos that might be offensive. \n \nIn Philadelphia, the department is considering tightening its policy after photos surfaced last fall of an officer in uniform with a tattoo on his forearm showing a Nazi symbol: a spread-winged eagle under the word \u201cFatherland.\u201d \n \nIn Chicago, a federal judge threw out a lawsuit filed by tattooed officers \u2014 all military veterans \u2014 who objected to a new requirement that they wear long sleeves to cover up their inked arms during a sweltering Midwestern summer. The judge argued it would be too difficult for departments to determine what would be considered offensive and need to be covered. \n \nBut, the police brass recently started allowing them again \u2014 they said as a morale booster for a beleaguered force.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Police news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Fashion police: Departments ease rules","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"97502","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Central Point","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bend Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668815","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2479"},"name":"Bend Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bendbulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204938644","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:06Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Polk County would see payments almost completely dry up after a reduction from $782,406 to $318. \n \nFor Marion County, the reduction would be from $1.8 million to $186,880, an 89.8 percent reduction. About 25 percent of Marion County, and 26.4 percent of the state of Oregon, is Forest Service land. \n \nThe law had provided gradually reduced payments since 2012 and was authorized a final time at $285 million in April 2015 and expired six months later. \n \nPayments to counties at the previous 25 percent level will start to be sent out in February, said Babete Anderson, the national press officer for the Forest Service. \n \n\u201cWe are working through the steps required to process the 25 percent fund payments expeditiously and anticipate making those payments by the middle of February,\u201d she said. \n \nSen.

There is not enough drama. It is not real football. \n \nBut Incognito, a Buffalo Bills guard, is like the vast majority of the 88 players invited to this all-star gathering tonight. He sees the Pro Bowl more as a celebration of achievement and as a way to thank the fans. \n \nHe would not change a thing. \n \n\u201cIn my mind it\u2019s as good as it should be,\u201d Incognito said. \u201cYou really can\u2019t ask guys to come out here and fly around at full speed when we\u2019ve been off for the last two or three weeks. And some guys are just coming down here after conference championship games. Maybe make it more fan interactive, get the fans involved more, do more of the skills competition.\u201d \n \nThe NFL has seemed open to ways to energize its showcase that is now sandwiched between conference championship and Super Bowl weeks. A few years ago the league broke from the traditional AFC-NFC Pro Bowl matchup and allowed celebrity coaches to draft two teams. \n \nNow, in hopes of giving the game a lift, the NFL has moved the Pro Bowl from Hawaii to Orlando, where it has become more of a weeklong event, complete with a re-imagined skills challenge. The AFC-NFC matchup has also returned after three years of nonconference games. \n \nStill, it remains to be seen if the NFL can continue selling a game that bears little resemblance to the product it puts on the field during the season. The players come to the Pro Bowl to have fun and not get hurt. And maybe win. \n \n\u201cThis Pro Bowl for me in a sense is special because you are coming here to celebrate what you\u2019ve accomplished,\u201d New York Giants receiver Odell Beckham Jr. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d \n \nSeattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman says the intensity would rise and more invited players would show up if the NFL gave them their weekly game salaries. Under the collective bargaining agreement, each player from the winning team will make $61,000 this week and the losing players will take home $30,000. \n \n\u201cYou pay them what you are paying them and you get this performance,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different element. \u2026 I guarantee you less guys would miss the Pro Bowl if you told you are going to pay them their normal salary for one more game.\u201d \n \nFormer NFL player and coach Herm Edwards says the game as played now is fine. He says the Pro Bowl is not about the game, it is about the fans and the players giving back. Thousands of fans have been out at ESPN\u2019s Wide World of Sports complex this week watching both teams practice. \n \nAfter the practices were over most of the players signed autographs and took pictures in the laid-back atmosphere. All of the practices are short and glorified walkthroughs, and the players are mostly having fun with each other and the fans. \n \n\u201cWe are all ambassadors to this great game of football and how you conduct yourself once you leave this practice field is more important than how you play the game,\u201d said Edwards, who now works as analyst. \u201cThe fans aren\u2019t going to remember the game. The fans remember if Odell Beckham, Patrick Peterson, or if Drew Brees takes a picture with them, signs an autograph.\u201d \n \nEdwards, however, understands the criticism. He even admits, as a football purist, he does not watch the Pro Bowl. But he says if the game does become more fiercely contested it would come at a cost that players, teams and even fans may not want to pay. \n \n\u201cThe only way to make it better is you do this: If you want all of them to show up, make the game worth $500,000,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThey will all show up and now they play. Here is the problem, when one of them gets hurt you have the same problem.\u201d \n \nOakland Raiders general manager Reggie McKenzie acknowledges being torn when his players are selected for the Pro Bowl. On one hand, he is excited for their recognition. On the other, he is concerned about injuries. \n \nMcKenzie would be in favor of more of skills challenge than a game where key players can be injured. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a risk,\u201d said McKenzie, who will have four players representing the AFC today. \u201cI cringe every time I go to practice, but it\u2019s the nature of the game. It\u2019s what it is. But you do everything you can to set your safety-type precautions. What else can you do? Not play?

Our high quality standards and credibility enables us to cater globally complying with strict safety regulations. \n\n\u201cThe ESMA certification will provide much needed assurance and \u2018peace-of-mind\u2019 for our customers in the region\u201d. He added. \n\nCommenting on awarding the certification, Mr. Essa Abdul Rahman Al Hashmi - Director of Conformity Affairs Department at ESMA, said: \u201cESMA has been responsible for regulating various products with the latest addition being the wiring devices. As per the new regulation, it is mandatory to have ESMA\u2019s ECAS or EQM certification. Panasonic\u2019s products have complied with our certification requirements and can be considered safe for use. As the first brand to receive the Emirates Quality Mark, Panasonic\u2019s strict standards have raised the bar for wiring devices across the GCC\u201d. \n\nProduct quality is an essential part of Panasonic\u2019s management philosophy, embodied in the company\u2019s code of conduct and overseen by chief quality officers who are responsible for the company\u2019s quality assurance system. \n\nPanasonic\u2019s wiring devices are distributed by Advance Establishment for Lighting & Electricals in UAE.

Consequently, builders are over their budgets, behind their schedules and close to laying off workers. \n \n\u201cWe haven\u2019t run into this in Bend before,\u201d said Jay Nees, project manager with Walsh Construction Co. , a commercial builder based in Portland. \n \nWalsh Construction broke ground on Range Apartments, a six-building apartment project in NorthWest Crossing, over the summer. Nees said the apartments would come onto the market in phases. The first buildings are still slated to open in late spring. But Nees said some of the buildings that broke ground later in the process are one to two months behind schedule. \n \nBetween finding materials that work in low temperatures and keeping work sites safe and clear of snow, ice and other winter hazards, Nees estimated that the cost of winter weather on the apartment project has exceeded $100,000. \n \n\u201cI think everyone\u2019s over budget at this point,\u201d Nees said. \n \nNees is far from alone. While estimates vary, many buildings in Central Oregon \u2014 from single-family homes to large commercial projects \u2014 are running between one and three months behind schedule. \n \nErich Schultz, co-founder and principal broker at Compass Commercial Real Estate Services , said he expects Crane Shed Commons, a 50,000-square-foot office building rising on SW Industrial Way, to be completed in July, rather than June as was initially predicted. \n \n\u201c(The weather) probably set us back about 30 days,\u201d Schultz said. \n \nDespite that, Dan Hopper, project manager for Kirby Nagelhout Construction Co. , the general contractor on the Crane Shed Commons project, said he has brought in additional equipment and staff, and expects the project to be completed by the end of June. \n \nOf course, winter in Central Oregon almost always means dealing with some amount of snow and ice. Brian Fratzke, founder and principal broker at Fratzke Commercial Real Estate , said one adjustment for builders who come to Bend from warmer climates is dealing with a more limited building season. He said many local asphalt plants close for the winter, meaning that driveways and parking lots can be difficult to complete between November and March. \n \n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a 12-month construction season; you just don\u2019t,\u201d Fratzke said. \n \nStill, this winter has been exceptional. Tim Knopp, executive vice president of Central Oregon Builders Association, a nonprofit for the construction industry, said builders can often continue working on commercial and residential projects through the heart of winter, taking a day or two off as needed. This winter, however, the combination of heavy snows and sustained low temperatures have made it more of a challenge. \n \n\u201cIt seems like every 10 to 15 years you get something like this (winter),\u201d Knopp said. \u201cI guess this is our year.\u201d \n \nFollowing a heavy snowfall, Knopp said construction crews have to shift gears, using gear intended for heavy construction for snow removal just to make the site usable. Nees added that Walsh has resorted to drastic measures \u2014 including renting a 120-by-50-foot wedding tent \u2014 to keep the foundation of an apartment building warm and without snow. \n \nEven more troublesome in certain cases are consistent hard freezes. Gary North, vice president of Bend-based R&H Construction , said freezes make it a challenge to lay and maintain concrete foundations of buildings. \n \nNorth added that the company has resorted to renting equipment that can heat the ground at work sites, which can be prohibitively expensive. Consequently, he said, a mixed-use development at the corner of NW Galveston Avenue and NW Federal Street, one of R&H\u2019s nine active projects in Central Oregon, is five to six weeks behind schedule. \n \n\u201cOnce the ground\u2019s frozen, you can\u2019t do much with it,\u201d North said. \n \nFinally, Nees said a variety of building materials, from asphalt to spray-foam insulation, don\u2019t work properly once the temperature drops below a certain threshold. \n \n\u201cThe cold shuts down a lot of things,\u201d he said. \n \nWhile it\u2019s too early to know the impact on Central Oregon\u2019s economy, the harsh winter could lead to layoffs in the region\u2019s resurgent construction industry. \n \nThe industry was among the Deschutes County\u2019s fastest-growing over the last couple of years. It added 980 jobs in Deschutes County between December 2014 and December 2016, a 20 percent increase. \n \nEven during normal weather patterns, winter is a period of job loss for Deschutes County\u2019s construction workers. Damon Runberg, Central Oregon economist for the Oregon Employment Department, wrote in an email that the construction industry in Deschutes County historically sheds 6.8 percent of its jobs between December and January. He added that the figure varies dramatically from winter to winter, however, and has stood at 2.5 percent over the previous three winters. \n \n\u201cI would presume that we will see a greater monthly drop than 2.5 percent when the January numbers are released due to the historic snow depth,\u201d Runberg wrote. \n \nNorth confirmed that R&H Construction was \u201cclose\u201d to weather-related layoffs for the company\u2019s staff of approximately 30 employees. \n \nFratzke added that the delays could create a backlog of work once the weather improves, keeping builders busy and preventing them from breaking ground on additional projects slated for later in the year. In a market that is running low on available industrial and commercial space, such a backlog could create problems. \n \nKnopp said it\u2019s too early to know exactly how significant those delays will be. If the heavy snows are done for the year in Central Oregon, he said most builders will be caught up on their work by the middle of summer. However, additional delays could mean that builders will be working through their backlog until next winter begins. \n \n\u201cThis is pretty exceptional,\u201d Knopp said. \n \n\u2014 Reporter: 541-617-7818, \n \nshamway@bendbulletin.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Historic winter puts construction work in a hole","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"97502","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Central Point","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bend Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668815","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2479"},"name":"Bend Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bendbulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://walshconstructionco.com/","http://www.compasscommercial.com/","http://kirbynagelhout.com/","http://www.fratzkecommercial.com/","http://rhconst.com/"],"sequenceId":"695204944664","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:07Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico. \n \nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends. \n \nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long. \n \nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports. \n \nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader. \n \nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion. \n \nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups. \n \nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism. \n \n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\" \n \nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said. \n \nThe story Families split as Trump Muslim ban 'banishes normal, honest people' first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Families split as Trump Muslim ban 'banishes normal, honest people'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2337","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Scone","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Scone Advocate","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169694713","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"The Scone Advocate","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sconeadvocate.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204945047","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Another said her housemate didn\u2019t pay her half of the rent. A third tenant purposely withheld her rent because parts of her roof had caved in and the landlord didn\u2019t make repairs. \n \nAll three \u2014 and more than a dozen others \u2014 received eviction notices, the common thread that brought them to the Deschutes County Circuit Court, along with landlords, property managers and attorneys. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a really big docket today,\u201d Justine Kenyon-Benson, a court supervisor, told the group. \n \nThe week before, on Jan. 17, 16 landlord-tenant suits were filed with the court \u2014 more than any day in 2016. \n \nCourt documents show that a majority of the tenants were accused of nonpayment of rent. \n \nAccording to court records, more than 323 landlord-tenant civil suits have been filed since Jan. 1, 2016. Since 2011, there have been more than 500 of those suits, and more than 3,500 eviction cases. \n \nThose are just the cases that make it to court. There\u2019s no way to keep track of the evictions that renters comply with because those never make it on a courthouse calendar. \n \nAlmost all of the renters in the courtroom on Wednesday admitted that they didn\u2019t pay on time. In most of these cases, the law was on the landlord\u2019s side. \n \nBut even when it isn\u2019t, tenants often don\u2019t know. \n \n\u201cLandlords and management companies typically know the system better, and they have better access to financial resources,\u201d said Mark Peterson, a retired Portland attorney who specializes in landlord-tenant law and has been involved in cases all over the state. \u201cTenants don\u2019t realize that they may be able to get a lawyer, and a powerful adversary can steamroll you. I\u2019ve seen tenants settle on terms that were terribly unfortunate for them.\u201d \n \nThere were two options, Kenyon-Benson explained to everyone who showed up to court: mediation or trial. For the three or four tenants who weren\u2019t present, an automatic judgment was filed in favor of the plaintiff. \n \nMediation is an option the Deschutes County Circuit Court offers landlords and tenants in these kinds of disputes. Instead of going straight into court, a court-provided volunteer mediator gives the parties a chance to come to an agreement without a court ruling. \n \n\u201cThe relationship between the parties in these cases is usually one where there\u2019s not a lot of trust,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThe mediator can help the two to speak. In most cases if the parties can settle then they can have a better shared result. A mediator can help people get past personal hurts.\u201d \n \nLetting a judge decide comes with risks. If a judge rules in a landlord\u2019s favor, an eviction will go on the tenant\u2019s record. And in a rental market like the one in Central Oregon, with a vacancy rate hovering around 1 percent or less, an eviction can be devastating for a renter. Also, in an eviction case, a judge doesn\u2019t make a ruling on rent owed \u2014 only who has a right to the property. A landlord typically won\u2019t be able to recover any money lost from the verdict. \n \n\u201cTrained mediators can save a lot of people from going to trial, where there\u2019s typically a loser and a winner or sometimes just two losers,\u201d Peterson said. \n \nAccording to statistics kept by Deschutes County Circuit Court, 23 mediators volunteered 493.5 hours during the 2015-2016 state fiscal year. \n \nOn Wednesday in Courtroom A, everyone agreed to mediation. \n \nMediation works out differently for different people, depending on their situation. \n \nFor Brad Johnson, a 20-year-old who was between jobs and couldn\u2019t pay his December rent, it allowed him to stay in his apartment, which is managed by local property management company PLUS Property. But there was a cost. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to have to go to trial because I knew there would be fees, and we both knew I was going to pay the rent, it was simply a matter of us getting it extended,\u201d he said. \u201cMe and (PLUS Property) knew what we were there for.\u201d \n \nJohnson said he had called PLUS Property when he knew he wasn\u2019t going to be able to pay on time and it agreed to let him pay late, with a $75 charge. But when he received an eviction notice the day after rent was due, he called again. \n \n\u201cThey were like \u2018Oh, you just have to go to court on the court date and we can extend it,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me service fees were going to be there.\u201d \n \nThe deal that came out of Johnson\u2019s mediation with PLUS Property allowed him to continue living in his apartment under his 12-month lease as long as he paid the $1,050 in rent he owed, plus fees. These included $79.99 for the court filing fees associated with the eviction notice, $40 to cover the cost of the time for a PLUS Property representative to be in court, and a $75 charge for the late rent. \n \nLawnae Hunter, who owns PLUS Property, said that her company sends eviction notices \u2014 even in instances that a prior agreement is reached, like in Johnson\u2019s case \u2014 so that the court can be involved with the agreement. She said that if a tenant doesn\u2019t have a history of paying rent late, or is facing an unusual set of circumstances, such as losing a job, her company usually tries to work out a payment plan instead of evicting. \n \n\u201cThe court system is such that you have to get into mediation with a written agreement,\u201d she said, adding that her company always chooses to mediate. \u201cSo we start with an eviction notice. You have to get it into the system, in case (tenants) don\u2019t do what was agreed.\u201d \n \nAs for the fees, Hunter said they\u2019re necessary because her company is representing a property owner that has costs and is paying to file in court. \n \n\u201cWe bill hourly rates, and it costs me more than $40 an hour to send someone over there,\u201d she said. \u201cWe keep that fee low.\u201d \n \nJaquita Harrison, 22, is a tenant with a different story. Harrison lives at Mountain Glen Townhomes with her 3-year-old daughter and a housemate. But when the housemate, who works in childcare, couldn\u2019t pay rent, Harrison said she didn\u2019t have enough to cover the gap. \n \nAfter mediation, Harrison agreed to move out by Friday. \n \n\u201cI went in and basically discussed what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cThe property manager basically said they want the property back because I\u2019m always late on rent. But I\u2019m always late because I get paid on the 10th and the 25th. I could\u2019ve paid the rent right there in court, and she told me no. I\u2019m a single mom. I have other bills. I can\u2019t pay it on the 1st or the 5th.\u201d \n \nThe mediation agreement that Harrison and Mountain Glen Townhomes signed gave Harrison 10 days to move out. She had asked for 30. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know where me and my daughter are going to go,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cI can\u2019t be homeless with her because it\u2019ll get her taken away from me \u2014 it\u2019s cold as hell outside. I work full time and she goes to school. I hardly get to see her as it is.\u201d \n \nA representative of Mountain Glen didn\u2019t return calls for comment. \n \nMichela Estrada\u2019s story is different as well. The only tenant who came to court with a lawyer on Wednesday, Estrada came away from mediation with an arguably better deal. \n \nThe reason Estrada had come to court in the first place was because of the weather. In December, one of the snowstorms caused parts of her roof to collapse. \n \nShe contacted PLUS Property Management, which manages the house she rents, to discuss the damage, but repairs were slow in coming. \n \nHunter, the owner of PLUS Property, said that she\u2019s not surprised about that delay. \n \n\u201cWe had a hard, hard time getting roofers throughout the big storm,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get a roofer at my own house when my garage ceiling is caved in. There was a waiting list.\u201d \n \nEstrada withheld her January rent because of the lack of repairs, and PLUS Property sent her an eviction notice. \n \n\u201cYour average landlord is a typical property owner \u2014 one or two rentals \u2014 and they don\u2019t have a large budget for massive leaks and snowstorms,\u201d said Joseph Harder, the attorney who represented Estrada. \u201cThey should always plan for it \u2014 they own these properties as an income-generating source, right? Snowstorm hits, roof caves in, no budget, and landlords are in a tough spot. They want to wait for the insurance to pay for it, but the bad thing is they have a tenant in there, and that\u2019s their home. So it needs to be taken care of quickly. It\u2019s hard for both.\u201d \n \nEstrada\u2019s court date arrived after living for a few weeks in a home with caved-in ceilings and a damaged interior, and also racking up a large utility bill because of increased heating costs. \n \nWhile most of the mediations that took place that day lasted an hour or so, the negotiation that took place between Harder and PLUS Property stretched on for about four hours. Harder said the deal that was ultimately negotiated was certainly preferable to Estrada having to move out, or being allowed to stay but having to pay a full month\u2019s rent for a caved-in roof. \n \n\u201cWe ended up negotiating it,\u201d Harder said, adding that Estrada had agreed to pay half of the rent she owed by Friday. \u201c(Estrada) wanted out, so we negotiated a way out of the lease, and now it\u2019s month to month. The landlord is paying for a portion of the cost increases because of the extra heating, and they agreed to waive a portion of rent and get on the repairs immediately. Probably a pretty good resolution for everybody.\u201d \n \nHunter agrees, adding that Estrada most likely didn\u2019t need a lawyer to come to that agreement. \n \n\u201cMediation is available to everybody,\u201d she said, noting she wasn\u2019t familiar with the specifics of Estrada\u2019s situation. \u201c(Estrada) didn\u2019t need a lawyer, she would have ended up with the same result. Our response would have been the same even if she didn\u2019t have a lawyer.\u201d \n \n\u2014 Reporter: 541-617-7829, \n \nawest@bendbulletin.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"A day in court: Landlords and tenants negotiate before eviction","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"97502","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Central Point","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bend Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668815","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2479"},"name":"Bend Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bendbulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204946599","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:11Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

She won 64 grand slam titles in total, including doubles and mixed doubles. \n \n\"I think she will break the record, and I think she will break it soon,\" Court said. \n \n\"It's so much easier for players today to do what they do. She hadn't played for about three months before coming here, and it easier to do these things. \n \n\"But she's playing very well, and records are made to be broken. \n \n\"People keep asking me, 'How do you feel about your record?' but I'm not going to lose any sleep over something like that. \n \n\"My life is very busy and full, and they'll never get my 64 so it's all right.

Kate Brown to have the state renew their contract to avoid the loss of those jobs next week, but a state official said there are no plans to continue the deal. \n \nRichard and Kathleen Chaves, who own Chaves Consulting Inc., are nearing the end of the first year under contract with the Oregon Health Authority. \n \nTheir employees, whose starting wage is $12 per hour and who have a benefits package including health, dental, vision and life insurance, take customer service calls for that agency, related to the Oregon Health Plan. \n \nThe $2.5 million contract was guaranteed for one year, and included five optional one-year renewals, Richard Chaves said. \n \nHe said last week that he has had no notification from the OHA that the agency intends to renew the contract for another year. The deal expires Tuesday. \n \nChris Pair, a spokesman in Brown\u2019s office, referred questions to OHA. \n \nMichelle McClellan, senior communications manager with OHA, wrote in an email: \u201cWe appreciate the job the Chaves team did fulfilling the temporary need for additional OHP (Oregon Health Plan) call center capacity, as we navigated the impact of a surge in enrollment and the adoption of a new online tool for OHP applicants and members that will streamline renewal processing, reduce call volume and lessen the need for call center assistance in the future.\u201d \n \nMcClellan said OHA signed contracts with Chaves Consulting and with another private firm that runs a call center in Salem to handle what agency officials expected would be a temporary increase in demand for call center workers. \n \nThe contract with the Salem company ends in March, and it is not scheduled to be extended. \n \n\u201cLike any private or public organization, we rely on partners like Chaves Consulting to provide support when we have temporary or unexpected demands,\u201d McClellan said in the email. \n \n\u201cChaves stepped up for us during a time when we had nearly 1.1 million OHP members and faced significant short-term demands. However, the improvements we\u2019ve made to automate and streamline the OHP application experience will make it simpler and easier for OHP members to manage their benefits \u2014 and reduce their need for phone support.\u201d \n \nChaves said OHA\u2019s position baffles him because his employees meet or exceed the state\u2019s performance standards at a cost to OHA that\u2019s roughly half what the agency pays to state employees who work at a call center in Salem; this center is run by the state, not by the private company whose contract expires in March. \n \nChaves said the state pays his company $50,900 per year for each call center employee. The state\u2019s current cost for salary and benefits is $73,500 per year for each call center worker, and that amount is slated to increase July 1 to $78,800. If other operating expenses for the state call center are factored in, the cost per worker for state employees is more than double the cost in the Chaveses\u2019 contract, he said. \n \nHe said the company did not request any increase were the state to renew the contract. \n \nChaves said he and his wife told their employees recently that the future of the contract, and of their jobs, is uncertain. \n \nIn a letter she sent this month to Brown, Kathleen Chaves wrote that \u201cour people will be devastated to lose their jobs.\u201d \n \n\u201cOur incredibly positive, dedicated people have come to work every day to demonstrate to OHA that they are deserving of their jobs and the results they\u2019ve achieved have proven that they are,\u201d Chaves wrote. \u201cThis is an opportunity for an Oregon governor to demonstrate that they are truly committed to employ deserving rural Oregon citizens who have proven their worth to the state.\u201d \n \nRichard Chaves said he and his wife have been asking OHA officials since August about renewing the contract. \n \nAlthough McClellan cited a declining need for call center workers as the reason OHA is not extending the Chaves contract, another OHA employee, in a recent email to Richard Chaves, focused instead on the state\u2019s budget shortfall, which is estimated at $1.8 billion for the two-year cycle that starts July 1. \n \nIn a Jan. 5, 2017, email to Richard Chaves, OHA employee Wesley Charley wrote: \u201cUnfortunately, after conversations with our budget team, we are not able to locate the additional money to extend the (Chaves Consulting) contract through March. As you are aware there are significant budgetary issues for Oregon as we close out this biennium and even more significant as we move into the next. I wish I was delivering better news. The work your team has been doing is great.\u201d \n \nCharley was referring to a two-month extension of the contract, however, not the full year the Chaveses had hoped for. \n \nDespite the OHA claims about budget shortfalls, the Chaveses learned, from information that Oregon Rep. Cliff Bentz, R-Ontario, obtained, that OHA is seeking authority to hire 179 new state employees when the new biennium starts July 1, and that some of those workers would be assigned to the state-owned call center in Salem. \n \nMcClellan confirmed that\u2019s the case. \n \nBrown\u2019s proposed budget for the next biennium includes money to hire 179 permanent employees for OHA, 77 of them call center workers. \n \nRichard Chaves said OHA\u2019s plan to hire new state call center workers in Salem, while deciding not to renew contracts with private firms in a rural county such as Baker, makes parts of Brown\u2019s inaugural speech earlier this month ring hollow. \n \nBrown spoke about the struggling economies in rural Oregon, saying, \u201cFor rural communities such as John Day or Powell Butte, as Republican leaders Ted Ferrioli and Mike McLane know so well, there is a disturbing gap between the unemployment rate in urban Oregon and rural Oregon. For families living in Columbia, Coos, Crook, or any of our rural counties, we must bust open the doors of opportunity so that individuals can find good-paying jobs right where they live.\u201d \n \nFerrioli, who like Bentz represents Baker County in the Legislature, said OHA\u2019s apparent intention to in effect replace Chaves Consulting\u2019s 54 employees, some of whom live in Union County, with more expensive state workers not only defies claims that the state is in dire financial straits, but it also seems antithetical to Brown\u2019s statements about the importance of rural jobs. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s a conflict with the governor\u2019s rhetoric,\u201d Ferrioli said. \u201cIt looks to me like you\u2019re moving jobs out of the private sector in rural Oregon and into the public sector. From a rural economic development standpoint it\u2019s a terrible decision. There\u2019s no reason to see these jobs go away.\u201d \n \nFerrioli said he had scheduled meetings with OHA officials and with the governor that were canceled earlier this month due to wintry weather. \n \nHe plans to reschedule those meetings, at which he will urge the state officials to renew the OHA contract with Chaves Consulting. \n \nIn the meantime, the Chaveses are just days away from having to lay off most of the workers they hired a year ago. \n \nRichard Chaves\u2019 eyes tear up and his voice hesitates when he describes the thank-you card he received Monday from those employees. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s as if they\u2019re thanking us for laying them off,\u201d he said. \n \nHe said he can\u2019t help but replay Brown\u2019s statement about people finding \u201cgood-paying jobs right where they live.\u201d \n \nChaves said that\u2019s precisely what he and his wife sought and accomplished when they secured the OHA call center contract. \n \nHe said the local residents they hired, a few of whom were living in their cars, have exceeded their expectations. \n \n\u201cI have never heard an OHA person say that our performance is anything but stellar,\u201d Chaves said. \u201cThe people that are working for us really want their jobs and they take a lot of pride in their positions, so they excel.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Portland news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Job markets news","group":"Business"}],"title":"End of call center contract in Baker City will lead to 54 layoffs","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"97502","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Central Point","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bend Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668815","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2479"},"name":"Bend Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bendbulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204949856","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He gained French citizenship when he was 20. \n \nHe has four children from his first marriage to a teacher. In 2010 he remarried, to concert violinist Anne Gravoin. \n \nValls makes no apologies for his pro-business stance and desire to modernise the Socialist party. \n \nBut his use of decrees to ram through contested economic reforms as prime minister, as well as a failed proposal to strip dual-national terrorists of their French citizenship, alienated many in the party. \n \nHamon, who hails from western Brittany, is the son of a dockworker father and secretary mother. \n \nHe began his political life as a student activist in the 1980s. \n \nIn 1986, aged 18, he joined massive student protests against proposed reforms which then rightwing president Jacques Chirac was forced to withdraw. \n \nA father of two with his partner Gabrielle Guallar, Hamon has a degree in history. \n \nBroken china \n \nValls has warned \"the left could die\" unless two \"irreconcilable\" factions -- one pragmatic and open to reforms, the other wedded to the class struggle -- unite. \n \nSuch statements have drawn comparisons to former British prime minister Tony Blair who dragged his Labour party towards the centre and won three successive elections. \n \nBut in recent years leftist voters across Europe have soured on the centre-left, preferring hard left leaders like Labour's Jeremy Corbyn in Britain or far-left parties like Spain's Podemos. \n \nValls is not the only one making dire warnings of a lasting rift within the party that swept the board in general elections just five years ago. \n \n\"The PS (Socialist Party) elephants have already broken everything in the china shop,\" said Yann Marec, deputy editor of the southern Midi Libre newspaper said. \n \n\"Hamon the Breton and his promises against Valls the Catalan and his thrusting chin: the spectacle smells of blood.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"France news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"French Socialists pick presidential candidate","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"TR","country":"Turkey"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Daily Sabah","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"536281658","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"312"},"name":"Daily Sabah","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailysabah.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204950430","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:15:31Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://ia.tmgrup.com.tr/0a019b/320/169/0/51/800/477?u=http://i.tmgrup.com.tr/dailysabah/2017/01/29/socialist-clash-utopian-hamon-takes-on-fighter-valls-1485677417042.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Proving you don't always get what you wish for. \n \nRETRO DREAMING \n \nTwo finals between the most compelling thirty somethings 'rivals' in the game, unseen for ten years in grand slam finals. Even if nothing else happened, Roger and Rafa in the final was enough but on top of that: Serena and Venus played a final; thirties were the new twenties with all finalists and most of the quarter-finalists aged thirty something; the world number one got beaten by a serve volleyer; oh and Ash Barty was playing WBBL cricket this time last year. \n \nTHE RETURN OF THE SERVE VOLLEY \n \nThe Zverev brothers made the biggest statement of this Open. Sascha because at 19 he has a game, as he showed in losing to Rafa, that will take him to tennis' peak. And Mischa because he played a game against Andy Murray that made many wonder if serve volley was back. \n \nIn Melbourne the courts and balls were faster. So Ivo Karlovic set a new Australian Open record for most aces in a match (75 against Horacio Zabellas). Games were taking less time than Rafa takes picking at his undies. \n \nTHE EFFING COMEBACK \n \nEff me if she didn't effing make the effing semis. FFS. Lucic-Baroni delivered the most candid on court post-match interview making her first quarter final in 20 years. \n \nAsked how she persisted for so long against so many obstacles she replied: \"Eff everything and everybody whoever tells you you can't do it. Just show up and win in your heart.\" \n \nShe then won her next match and this time tearfully hinted more at the back story for why the woman dubbed 'The next Steffi Graf' had not realised that potential for 20 years. \n \nTWEET TWEET \n \nRoger does everything the best, even tweets. Federer tweeted a video of his new boy band \u2013 him, Gregor Dimitrov and Tommy Haas \u2013 singing \"Hard to say I'm Sorry\". \n \nALL ADVICE WELCOME, NOT HEEDED \n \nIf losing after imploding on the court wasn't enough Mark Philippoussis giving career advice on how to right his career has to be Nick Kyrgios' penny drop moment. \n \nHis meltdown loss to Andreas Seppi came after being up two sets to one and a break. Afterwards he admitted, finally, that hey being the only player in the top 100 without a coach might not be the smartest move. \n \nWHO ARE YOU WEARING? \n \nEven Daria 'Dasha' Gavrilova did a double take when she appeared on court against Timea Bacsinszky wearing identical outfits. \n \n\"It's a bit weird, but what can we do?,\" she said. \n \nIt sent social media buzzing in the way only the truly irrelevant can and was only outdone by Mirka Federer's jumper choice - a pink and green Gucci number with the words L'aveugle par amour, (\"blind love\", or \"blinded by love\") written on it. Big in central Europe but not so pleasing to tennis fans it seems. \n \nTHE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE OF \"WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN AT?\" \n \nThings got testy on court between bustling Jo Wilfried Tsonga and Stan Wawrinka who is ordinarily as deadpan as a fondue bowl. \n \nTsonga muttered about Wawrinka giving him greasy looks. \n \n\"I looked at you when? Did I look at you at all? It's a tennis match. You've got to calm down, relax a bit.\" Wawrinka protested quite reasonably. \n \n\"There's no worries,\" Tsonga said. But plainly there is. \n \nThe pair both live in Switzerland and had been close but things went awry a few years ago after Stan's first slam when Tsonga was quoted in L'Equipe saying \"If Stan can win a slam, then I deserve one too\". \n \nADIEU \n \nAnd with that we bid adieu to Australian Open 2017. Welcome back next year when Pat Rafter and Pete Sampras are favourites to play in the final on a green court.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"The hits and misses of the tournament","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Sydney Morning Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587970","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Sydney Morning Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.smh.com.au/","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204951983","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Iran said Saturday that it would stop U.S. citizens from entering the country, in retaliation for Trump\u2019s order. \n \nThe U.S. freestyle wrestling team is scheduled to participate in a World Cup competition in Iran on Feb. 8. Steve Fraser, the chief fundraiser for USA Wrestling and a 1984 Greco-Roman Olympic champion, said Saturday that the president of Iran\u2019s wrestling federation was scheduled to meet this weekend with government officials there in an attempt to make sure the Americans would still be invited to the meet. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s some nervousness by us that the Iranian government might say, \u2018We can\u2019t get visas to go there, so no Americans can come here, either,\u2019\u201d Fraser said. \n \nWhile Olympic boycotts have resulted from tense political differences between nations, opposing countries have also long found common ground on playing fields, on the track and in sports arenas. One of the most celebrated examples is the \u201cPing-Pong diplomacy\u201d that helped open the relationship between the United States and China in the 1970s. \n \nIn wrestling, the United States, Iran, Cuba and Russia banded together in 2013 to persuade the IOC to keep the sport in the Summer Games. American wrestlers and officials are warmly welcomed in Iran, and Iranian wrestlers compete regularly in the United States. They may be invited to meets in May in New York and in June in Los Angeles, Fraser said. There is uncertainty now, however, about whether they would be granted P1 visas, commonly known as sports visas, to compete. \n \nChristina Kelley, chief international ambassador for USA Wrestling who in 2014 became one of the few women allowed into a wrestling arena in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, said Saturday that she was frustrated by Trump\u2019s decision. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t think our current president has any clue what the State Department and what sports diplomats and cultural exchanges do for our country and for the safety of our people around the world,\u201d Kelley said. \n \nThe ban on visitors from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen comes at a delicate time for the U.S. Olympic Committee. Los Angeles is seeking to host the 2024 Summer Games, and it will learn in September whether it, Paris or Budapest will get the games. \n \nDavid Wallechinsky, an American member of the IOC\u2019s cultural and heritage commission and president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, said the election of Trump in November hurt Los Angeles\u2019s bid with IOC delegates because Trump is perceived as being \u201canti-Muslin, anti-woman and anti-Latino.\u201d \n \n\u201cThis is worse,\u201d Wallechinsky said of the Muslim ban, adding that \u201cI would consider it a blow to the Los Angeles bid, not fatal, but a blow.\u201d \n \nAt a meeting at the Lausanne, Switzerland, headquarters of the IOC several days after the U.S. presidential election, Wallechinsky said he was asked repeatedly, \u201cWhat is wrong with your country?\u201d \n \nHe said he sought to assure IOC officials by explaining that three-quarters of the voters in Los Angeles voted against Trump, describing the city to them as a \u201ca multicultural, Trump-free zone.\u201d \n \nThe United States is expected to bid to host the world\u2019s other major sporting event, the World Cup, in 2026. In June, Sunil Gulati, president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, told reporters that a Trump presidency could complicate a U.S. bid, especially if it were a joint bid with Mexico, given Trump\u2019s plans to build a wall across American\u2019s southern border. \n \n\u201cI think a co-hosted World Cup with Mexico would be trickier if Secretary Clinton isn\u2019t in the White House,\u201d Gulati said at the time, in a reference to Hillary Clinton, who lost the election to Trump. \n \nAfter Trump won the election, Gulati modified his remarks, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to dissuade us or persuade us to bid.\u201d International perceptions of the Trump administration \u201cmatter, for sure,\u201d Gulati said, \u201cbut I think those will be developed in the months to come.\u201d \n \nGulati and U.S. Soccer, reached by telephone, declined to comment Saturday. \n \nMany questions remained unanswered about the ability to travel for a number of athletes. Two NBA players, Thon Maker and Luol Deng, were born in Sudan, one of the seven countries listed in Trump\u2019s executive order. \n \nMaker\u2019s family fled his home country when he was 5 and eventually settled in Australia. Maker, who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks, moved to the United States to play high school basketball in Louisiana, eventually moved to Canada, and is an Australian citizen who holds a passport from that country. \n \nDeng, a forward for the Los Angeles Lakers, has lived in the United States for 17 years. His family fled to Egypt when he was 5 to escape the Sudanese civil war. Deng came to the United States when he was 14 and attended high school in New Jersey. \n \nThe NBA also holds an annual Basketball Without Borders camp, and it is expected to be held in New Orleans during All-Star Weekend in February. While rosters have not been released, last year\u2019s camp involved players from 25 countries, including Amir Reza Shah-Ravesh from Iran. \n \nMajor League Soccer has two U.S.-born players with familial ties to two of the nations facing bans: Steve Beitashour of Toronto has played for Iran\u2019s national team, and Justin Meram of Columbus has played for Iraq. League officials were looking into the matter Saturday. \n \nMo Farah of Britain, who was born in Somalia and has won four Olympic gold medals on the track at 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, is a Nike-sponsored athlete coached by Alberto Salazar. It remains unclear whether Farah would be allowed into the United States to train or compete. Salazar did not immediately respond to an email Saturday. Farah is in Ethiopia training for an event in Britain. He lives in the Portland area. \n \n\u201cWe clearly need to understand the implications of this new U.S. immigration policy and will be seeking assurances that it will not adversely affect\u201d track and field\u2019s world championships, scheduled to be held in Eugene in 2021, said Jackie Brock-Doyle, a spokeswoman for the sport\u2019s world governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations. \n \nPhil Andrews, chief executive of USA Weightlifting, said officials were trying to figure out the impact of Trump\u2019s ban on the world weightlifting championships, scheduled for November in Anaheim, California, and on the U.S. team\u2019s participation at a competition in Iran. \n \n\u201cOur view is that politics and sport should be separate,\u201d Andrews said, stressing sports diplomacy among nations. \u201cWe sincerely hope to peacefully welcome these seven nations to Anaheim this November. It is unimaginable to be able to host a true world event without their participation.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"How will Trump\u2019s ban affect sports?

Apollo alleges that the city\u2019s design and contract documents were \u201cdefective and deficient,\u201d and is suing Bend for $8 million for unpaid work and damages. \n \nHowever, the city of Bend says the added costs and delays were instead due to Apollo\u2019s poor management and failure to follow the contract \u2014 not issues with CH2M Hill, which has not been brought into the lawsuit. The city also says Apollo\u2019s allegations about damages are \u201clegally insufficient,\u201d and that the company is only owed about $4 million in unpaid work. \n \nTo date, the project has cost city taxpayers about $24 million on construction, $10.8 million for engineering and construction management and $2.7 million in consultants and attorneys \u2014 but has yet to be finished. \n \nThe city blames Apollo for the problems, but the lawsuit could still come with a hefty price tag for Bend taxpayers. They\u2019ll be on the hook to pay for going to court, as well as hiring a new contractor to finish the sewer plant. The outcome of the lawsuit will determine who will take the blame for the problems \u2014 Apollo, CH2M Hill or the city of Bend. \n \nHowever, an examination of city email records obtained by The Bulletin reveals a slew of problems beyond Apollo\u2019s construction troubles. Email records show issues including CH2M Hill working beyond its budget and challenges bringing contract increases to city councilors. In addition, two top city public works officials were longtime employees of CH2M Hill. \n \nMeanwhile, city officials say CH2M Hill\u2019s construction management costs were much higher than anticipated, which in part led the project to go over budget. They also say a poor working relationship between CH2M Hill and Apollo led to further problems including the project running more than a year behind schedule. \n \nHowever, city records show the sewer treatment plant isn\u2019t the first CH2M Hill project that\u2019s experienced problems. The sewer treatment plant contract is only one of 20 contracts the city of Bend has awarded CH2M Hill over the past decade, which total nearly $22 million, according documents The Bulletin obtained from the city. \n \nIn 2010, the city swallowed a $106,000 mistake when CH2M Hill\u2019s designs for a manhole were off by a couple of feet during the city\u2019s southeast interceptor sewer project. Jim Wodrich, a city engineer who previously worked as a planner for CH2M Hill, was involved in negotiating with the firm to determine if the company was liable for the $106,000 manhole mistake. \n \nSewer plant problems \n \nIn 2009, the city of Bend hired CH2M Hill for about $200,000 to start preliminary designs for the sewer plant expansion. That contract was extended several times to pay CH2M Hill to finish engineering work, which totaled about $5.5 million. \n \nEventually, CH2M Hill was hired to work as the project\u2019s construction manager. Today, the contract\u2019s total value is $10.8 million. \n \nBudgeting problems with the project began to surface in 2011, when Bend City Manager Eric King said an accounting software error caused CH2M Hill\u2019s cost for design work to jump from $2 million to about $4 million . \n \nAfter CH2M Hill\u2019s initial design work was finished, the city decided to extend CH2M Hill\u2019s contract, and hire the firm as the project\u2019s construction manager for an additional $4.5 million. That brought CH2M Hill\u2019s contract, which was initially only for engineering work, to about $10 million. \n \nHowever, that decision was made without opening the job to a public competitive bid, which would allow other companies to submit proposals. \n \nCity email records show a local construction company emailed the city expressing interest in submitting a proposal. Bend\u2019s Public Works Director Paul Rheault, who worked for CH2M Hill for 16 years before taking a job at the city, responded to the email by saying that keeping CH2M Hill on board would decrease costs in the long run by allowing city staff to do more work. \n \nBut keeping CH2M Hill on as the construction manager would lead to thousands of dollars in unexpected costs. \n \nBend City Manager Eric King said there is a lengthy review process before all big contract changes are approved. There are multiple people involved, and sometimes committees are formed to review the decision, he said. \n \n\u201cThere is no one individual that has the authority to make decisions,\u201d King said. \n \nOver budget \n \nAbout three years later, in 2014, city staff started to realize the sewer plant project was going drastically over budget, according to city email records. \n \nIn an attempt to get the project back on track, the city decided to hire Wodrich, who had left the city to work for HDR Engineering, for up to $345,000 to help manage the project. \n \nIn an email exchange that took place in Nov. 2014, Wodrich told Jeff England, the city\u2019s engineer for the project, that project costs were higher than expected. England responded to the email, saying that convincing Eric King and council to approve an additional $1.2 million would be difficult. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s really no advance notice that we are this far out of scope and budget,\u201d said England in the email. \n \nOn Tuesday, England said telling the consultant that there are difficulties getting contract increase approved is a negotiation tactic. \n \n\u201cIn other words, I\u2019m already pushing back on the consultant in order to minimize any potential cost increases,\u201d England said. \n \nBut months after the email exchange, city staff had yet to ask the City Council to increase the contract, and CH2M Hill was about to run out of money. CH2M Hill planned on working beyond the $4.5 million contract increase that had previously been approved by the council, according to city email records. \n \n\u201cThe sensitivity of the issue cannot be overstated and the timing for bringing (the amendment) forward, in whatever form, is of critical importance,\u201d said England in an email to CH2M Hill staff. \u201cHad we taken it to council two weeks ago as originally planned, we probably wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation because in all likelihood I would no longer be employed here \u2014 not kidding.\u201d \n \nOn Tuesday, England said there were no problems involving the amendment and bringing it forward for councilors\u2019 approval. Instead, the sensitivity of the issue had to do with the level of uncertainty about the project\u2019s future, England said. \n \nAt the time, the city was talking with another company to take over construction management services from CH2M Hill. City officials were also having discussions with attorneys about how to tackle problems with Apollo, he said. \n \nTom Hickmann, the director of the city\u2019s engineering department, said it took a while to bring the contract increase forward to city councilors because CH2M Hill\u2019s construction management costs were much higher than expected. Those costs grew after Apollo\u2019s construction didn\u2019t pass inspections, which meant CH2M Hill had to do more design work, he said. \n \nThe unexpected costs were something Bend\u2019s city councilors didn\u2019t take lightly, he said. \n \n\u201cThis is ballooning much bigger and even though I can sit here and defend all of it, the appearance of this it doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d said Hickmann. \u201cAnd we were certainly concerned about that public appearance even though we can defend (the costs incurred).\u201d \n \nKing, the city manager, said he was unaware of the email exchanges and any issues involving the contract increase. He said it\u2019s not unusual that city staff overseeing projects negotiate with the companies hired to build and oversee them. \n \n\u201cTheir job is to make sure that they can make the case,\u201d he said. \n \nThe Bend City Council eventually approved the contract increase in November 2015, nearly a year after staff knew the project was running over budget. The contract change increased CH2M Hill\u2019s contract by about $840,000 \u2014 more than $600,000 of which went to paying the company back for work that had been completed beyond the original contract\u2019s scope. \n \nAt that time, CH2M Hill\u2019s design errors and omissions on the project totaled between $415,000 and $620,000 \u2014 not including additional redesign and construction costs, according to city documents. In general, a certain number of design errors are considered normal \u2014 about 3 percent of total construction costs, according to city documents. \n \nAt that point, the city had approved about $1 million for construction changes, \u2014 about 3.17 percent of the project\u2019s total cost. \n \nCity of Bend officials would not comment about what portion of those construction changes were caused by design errors. However, Hickmann said a 3 to 5 percent change in the construction amount is not uncommon, and is not indicative of any serious design flaws. \n \nCH2M Hill officials would not comment on its involvement with the project. \n \nTaxpayers on the hook? \n \nDepending on what happens in court, taxpayers could be on the hook to pay Apollo up to $8 million on top of the $24 million the city has paid the company to date. \n \nSo far, the city has also spent about $465,000 on legal fees, which includes mediation efforts with Apollo. However, those legal costs will rise if the case goes to trial. \n \nDepending on the outcome of lawsuit, Bend taxpayers may also be footing the bill to finish 15 percent of the project that hasn\u2019t been completed. \n \nThis time, the construction project will be overseen by more strict city procedures, in part because of dealings with the sewer treatment plant project, said Hickmann. Several city policies were changed in response to problems on the project, he said. \n \nFor example, the city now tries to stay away from hiring outside engineering firms to work as construction managers on projects they\u2019ve designed, said Hickmann. Meanwhile, the city also made its request for proposal process more stringent, he said. Additionally, the city plans to avoid low-bid contract awarding \u2014 which is how Apollo was awarded the construction contract \u2014 in the future, Hickmann said. \n \n\u201cWe certainly didn\u2019t want to end up where we\u2019ve ended up,\u201d said Hickmann. \u201cWe did everything we could that we could think of in bringing outside expertise to help guide us to get the project on its rails and keep it there. And despite all that effort, we weren\u2019t successful.\u201d \n \n\u2014 Reporter: 541-633-2160, mriker@bendbulletin.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Construction news","group":"Industry"}],"title":"Bend sewer project plagued with cost overruns","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"97502","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Central Point","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bend Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668815","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2479"},"name":"Bend Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bendbulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204956259","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They\u2019re failing clinical inspection after clinical inspection after clinical inspection. And yet, nothing is ever done to address it.\u201d \n \nBut things appear to be changing for the better since the arrival, early last year, of Amanda Juza as the Vet Center\u2019s new director. She started by getting patient records in order and meeting with employees individually to ensure they understood their duties. \n \n\u201cIn terms of continuity of care, in terms of providing the best care for veterans, absolutely our records need to be up to date and they need to be accurate and timely,\u201d said Juza, an Army veteran. \n \nThat\u2019s no small task. A 2016 inspection report echoed deficiencies from previous investigations and noted that counseling notes hadn\u2019t been completed for more than 300 patient visits. Half of the client files reviewed didn\u2019t have the military discharge paperwork used to prove eligibility. Seventy-five treatment plans were overdue. \n \nThe report was blunt: Juza had \u201cinherited counselors who weren\u2019t doing their jobs.\u201d \n \nNo records for claim \n \nStandiford, a veteran who currently works for the nonprofit Central Oregon Veterans Outreach, first learned about problems at the Vet Center while handling veteran\u2019s issues in Congressman Greg Walden\u2019s Bend office. \n \nMultiple veterans told Standiford they were struggling to get their claims for service-connected disability approved through the VA because the Vet Center could not provide records of their counseling, he said. \n \n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t prove that the veteran actually went to or received treatment on the dates that they claimed because if it\u2019s not in the record, it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. \n \nStandiford began working at the Vet Center as an office manager in March 2014. His suspicion prompted a deeper dive into the facility\u2019s records, turning up more than 200 patient visits over the course of six months in 2014 that were accounted for on paper log-in sheets but not documented in electronic records. He said many of those patients had been seen by Gary Hunter, a counselor who also directed the Vet Center. \n \nHunter, who continues to work at the Vet Center as a counselor, declined to comment for this article. Juza would not offer details about why Hunter was allowed to remain a counselor. \n \nEvidence of disability \n \nI nstructions for filing a claim for disability benefits with the Veterans Benefits Administration directs veterans to provide all relevant evidence in their possession, including treatment records and medical evidence. Vet Centers are not involved in the process beyond providing records. \n \nThe Center always gives clients their records when they ask for them, Juza said. She said it\u2019s also possible to get disability benefits for PTSD without having received counseling, although she couldn\u2019t explain more about the process. \n \nDavid Kaplan, chief professional officer for the American Counseling Association, a membership association for the counseling profession, said when he was in private practice, he provided treatment records for veteran clients for use in disability assessments. \n \nJuza said she does not recall speaking with veterans whose lack of records prompted the rejection of their disability claims. The Bulletin could not confirm any claims of veterans being denied benefits as a result of bad record keeping. \n \nStarting over with vets \n \nOnce Juza took over, new counselors had to start over with veterans because their former counselors hadn\u2019t kept records from their visits, she said. Juza declined to say whether former counselors were disciplined, but said at least one was transferred to a different Vet Center. \n \n\u201cThere were a lot of veterans that we as a team had to say, \u2018I\u2019m really sorry, unfortunately, the counselor who saw you before is gone,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201c\u2018They\u2019re not here anymore and this was never completed, so if you don\u2019t mind, maybe we could start again.\u2019\u201d \n \nThe American Counseling Association\u2019s code of ethics directs counselors to keep notes of all their sessions with clients. \n \nMissing records from a previous counselor could trigger a lack of trust in the new one, Kaplan said. \n \n\u201cIf somebody said that to me, my feeling was, \u2018That other counselor didn\u2019t care about me. They didn\u2019t care about me at all. \u2026 Why should I open up to you and give you a chance to earn my trust?\u2019\u201d he said. \n \nStandiford agreed. \n \n\u201cThat vet will need to start at the beginning to get that person up to speed, which \u2014 speaking as a combat vet with PTSD \u2014 that is not a fun thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes a long time to build that rapport.\u201d \n \n\u2018Bureaucracy at its worst\u2019 \n \nHunter led the Vet Center during Standiford\u2019s time there in addition to working as a counselor. \n \nA handful of veterans described having personal issues with Hunter\u2019s counseling style. \n \nRoger Riolo, a 73-year-old Vietnam veteran who lives in Bend, is a longtime member of a counseling group for veterans with PTSD. When Hunter started leading the group, Riolo said some veterans stopped going because of they weren\u2019t comfortable with him. \n \n\u201cWe had bad experiences with Gary,\u201d he said. \n \nRiolo, a former Air Force captain, recalls one veteran who appeared to be struggling with severe PTSD and never spoke at meetings. Finally, after several months, the man began to talk about his experience. \n \n\u201cGary shut him down in group immediately and said, \u2018We don\u2019t talk about that stuff here,\u2019\u201d Riolo said. \u201cWe never saw that guy again.\u201d \n \nThat incident upset many in the room, said Rex Tompkins, a 69-year-old Vietnam War veteran who lives in Bend. \n \n\u201cEverybody in the group just looked at each other and went, \u2018That was messed up,\u2019\u201d he said. \n \nTroy Wise, a 69-year-old Army veteran who served two tours in the Vietnam War, said after that, he and others were fed up with Hunter. \n \n\u201cThe group made it clear that if Gary showed up, we were leaving,\u201d he said. \n \nWise also received couple\u2019s counseling with Hunter and said the counselor would have trouble referring to previous sessions. It seemed to him Hunter hadn\u2019t kept good notes from previous sessions. \n \n\u201cThat didn\u2019t work for me at all,\u201d said Wise, who is now divorced. \u201cLike most of the vets there, I have no respect for Gary. He\u2019s just putting in time.\u201d \n \nBefore he left the Vet Center, which employed five people, Standiford said he and two colleagues signed a letter of no confidence calling for Hunter\u2019s resignation. When nothing came of it, Standiford said he quit. VA spokesman Dave Bayard declined to comment on Standiford\u2019s departure. \n \nRiolo describes the situation as a \u201ctravesty.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt was bureaucracy at its worst,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen three employees stand up and say we have no confidence \u2014 thank God they did \u2014 but none of those three work there anymore, and Gary Hunter still does.\u201d \n \n\u2018A considerable number of complaints\u2019 \n \nProblems started shortly after the Center Oregon Vet Center began seeing patients from a temporary location in 2010. That year, it failed its first clinical inspection. \n \nThe VA provided The Bulletin copies of inspection reports dating back to 2011 in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. Although the 2010 report was not provided, the 2013 report deemed the facility unsatisfactory \u201cfor the third year in a row.\u201d \n \nThe VA\u2019s regional office strives to perform clinical inspections of Vet Centers annually, Bayard wrote in an email. Clinical inspections are a subjective analysis of the quality of service provided and focus heavily on patient charts. \n \nThe inspections repeat the same issues year after year. Each are signed by Steve Reeves, the manager of the Fairfield, California, office that oversees Vet Centers in Oregon and a number of other states. Reeves did not respond to multiple requests seeking comment. \n \nIn 2011, the clinical inspection report found nearly half of the Vet Center\u2019s cases lacked proof of eligibility, although about half of those had been transferred in from a different VA clinic. Eighty percent of closed cases were missing summaries the VA requires when patients stop coming. \n \nThe report\u2019s concluding remarks were damning. \n \n\u201cThere have been a considerable number of complaints from various members of the Veteran and Veteran services community since this center was opened,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThese complaints have continued and have required interventions by the regional office.\u201d \n \n\u2018No longer functioning as a team\u2019 \n \nBy 2015, the Vet Center seemed to have reached a breaking point. That year\u2019s inspection report cited \u201cmultiple staffing challenges and disagreements to the point where it is no longer functioning as a team\u201d and said its reputation had suffered greatly due to the \u201cinconsistent services\u201d provided. \n \nThat year, several patient files were missing treatment plans or the plans were late. Treatment plans outline the issues a patient wants to resolve. \n \nDozens of patient files were missing their military release or discharge documents, which serve as proof of eligibility. Seventy percent of patients whose cases were closed had not been sent a follow-up letter or email, which is required. \n \nKaplan said the American Counseling Association considers failing to follow up with clients who fail to make appointments abandonment. \n \n\u201cWe have a responsibility to try to reach out to them and say, \u2018Hey, is everything OK? Would you want to make another appointment?\u2019\u201d he said. \n \nHunter stepped down as the Center\u2019s leader in 2015. \n \nProblems persisted into the following year, when an inspection found 42 intakes were past due. Intakes are performed when clients begin counseling and assess issues, behaviors, thought patterns and contributing factors such as drug use, medical conditions or relationships. \n \n\u201cWithout that kind of thorough assessment, you\u2019re just sort of flying by the seat of your pants,\u201d Kaplan said. \n \nProgress notes \u2014 about what happened during counseling sessions \u2014 hadn\u2019t been completed in 326 cases, according to the 2016 report. \n \n\u201cLet\u2019s say you went for a checkup and the physician did not write a single thing down,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cHow would you feel?\u201d \n \nDisagreements between staff \n \nEmails between Vet Center staff members in recent years provided by Standiford illustrate a precarious work environment. \n \nBoth Standiford and Wells Kempter, then a counselor at the Vet Center, expressed concerns to superiors about financial ties the Vet Center and its outreach specialist, Greg Ford, had with outside groups. It\u2019s unclear whether ethical or legal violations existed. Kempter, who is currently listed as a counselor on the Portland Vet Center\u2019s website, could not be reached for comment. \n \nFord, who declined to comment for this article, now serves in a newly created position at the Vet Center focused on suicide prevention and crisis response, Juza said. \n \nCounselors Kempter and Hemmer both complained in 2014 emails to Hunter \u2014 which they included Standiford on \u2014 about new clients being placed on their caseload without their knowledge. \n \n\u201cArbitrarily assigning people, w/o informing me of this action, at worst, sets me up for failure as a member of this team and at best creates a lot more work for me that may not be completed in a timely manner, since I hadn\u2019t been consulted or informed,\u201d Hemmer wrote. \n \nThe tension between staff members was obvious to Tompkins when he visited the Vet Center for both individual and group counseling. The negativity \u2014 among both employees and fellow veterans \u2014 prompted him to stop going. He\u2019s currently being treated for lung cancer. \n \n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t deal with it anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to keep my attitude high. I have to keep positive.\u201d \n \n\u2018Just what this place needs\u2019 \n \nVeterans interviewed for this article say they lobbied hard for a new director to replace Hunter. They wanted Juza, a Blue River native who served two tours in the Iraq War, to lead the facility. \n \n\u201cShe seems like just what this place needs,\u201d Wise said. \n \nJuza, a licensed independent clinical social worker, welcomed the change. She worked at the Portland Vet Center before coming to Bend. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m not really a city girl,\u201d Juza said. Plus, Central Oregon is closer to family. \n \nOn top of her administrative duties, Juza also performs counseling. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology and a master\u2019s degree in social work. Juza is the facility\u2019s only female counselor and its designated military sexual trauma counselor. \n \nWise said he found one-on-one counseling with Juza comforting after his divorce. \n \n\u201cShe helped a great deal with taking the worst-case scenario and making a plan for it,\u201d he said. \n \nJuza has added a women\u2019s group and a class for military spouses and family members. The Center now sends counselors to La Pine, Prineville and Madras. A counselor also sees veterans at the Deschutes County jail every two weeks. \n \nThere are weekly staff meetings, and Juza said she performs extensive reviews of patient charts once a month. \n \nUntil Juza arrived, 71-year-old Vietnam veteran Craig Jorgensen said the Center was \u201cpretty chaotic and not very helpful.\u201d Recently, he said things are turning around. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s things that are happening that never happened before,\u201d Jorgensen said. \n \nDespite failing its 2016 clinical inspection, the report noted it expected significant improvements the following year. \n \nJuza said she wants veterans to know that the Vet Center is \u201cre-energized.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe are basically a brand-new facility from what it was in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cand we would really love the opportunity to earn a chance to get to know them.\u201d \n \n\u2014 Reporter: 541-383-0304, \n \ntbannow@bendbulletin.com","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Vietnam news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Veterans news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Veterans hope new director improves counseling center","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"97502","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Central Point","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bend Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668815","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2479"},"name":"Bend Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bendbulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/evidence.asp"],"sequenceId":"695204956434","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:09Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But they have not watched either in years, mainly out of embarrassment. Think of your parents breaking out the childhood home movies on prom night. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s been on TV a couple of times back at home,\u201d Gerry said. \u201cWe just kind of skip right through it.\u201d \n \nCritics panned \u201cBaby Geniuses,\u201d about super-smart toddlers communicating in their own language, for an over-the-top script and awkward computer-generated special effects. (The Fitzgeralds took turns playing twins.) \n \nOne scene appeared to feature Gerry in a white disco suit dancing like Tony Manero, John Travolta\u2019s character in \u201cSaturday Night Fever.\u201d A stunt double did the dancing, with Gerry\u2019s head superimposed in postproduction. \n \nIn The New York Times, Janet Maslin began her review of the movie with this: \u201cOne way to get through \u2018Baby Geniuses\u2019 is to think about whether it really is the worst movie you\u2019ve ever seen. Probably not, but pretty darn close.\u201d Film critic Roger Ebert called it one of the worst movies of 1999. \n \nWhen \u201cSuperbabies: Baby Geniuses 2\u201d wrapped, so did the Fitzgeralds\u2019 big-screen careers. \n \n\u201cThey did those two movies, and in between they were typical little boys,\u201d their mother, Janet Fitzgerald, said in a telephone interview from Port Alberni. \u201cTheir love was hockey from the day they put skates on when they were like 5 years old. Hockey was their passion. Acting was definitely not their passion.\u201d \n \nThough undersize \u2014 Leo is 5 feet 9, Gerry 5-8 and Myles 5-7 \u2014 the Fitzgeralds formed such a prolific forward line through junior hockey that they were twice traded as a unit. Their wish to attend college together brought them to Bemidji State, an NCAA Division I program in the north woods of Minnesota that made an unexpected run to the Frozen Four in 2009. \n \nNow juniors, the 23-year-old triplets have combined for 15 goals for the 20th-ranked Beavers (16-9-3 overall), who lead the Western Collegiate Hockey Association standings by nine points and seek their first NCAA Tournament berth since 2010. \n \nResearch by Bemidji State officials turned up only one other set of triplets on the same college team: Brian, Craig and Glenn Seabury of Mass.-Lowell from 1989 to 1990. \n \n\u201cIn junior hockey, you could just see it \u2014 they were rink rats,\u201d Bemidji State coach Tom Serratore said of the Fitzgeralds. \u201cThose are the kind of guys you want on your team because you never have to motivate them. We really wanted those guys, and we worked on them for a while.\u201d \n \nSerratore mostly kept the Fitzgeralds on the same line in their first two seasons, with Myles on left wing, Leo at center and Gerry on right wing. The Beavers captain, Charlie O\u2019Connor, described them as \u201cthree fireballs on the ice at once, kind of like three Tasmanian devils.\u201d \n \nBut this season Serratore, seeking better offensive balance, moved Myles off the line and installed senior Brendan Harms on left wing with Leo and Gerry. That line has accounted for 19 of Bemidji State\u2019s 66 goals. \n \nHockey players can be cruel teasers, and Harms said the Fitzgeralds still took occasional needling about the movies. Serratore, though, has never shown either film on the team bus. For that, the triplets are grateful. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m surprised they haven\u2019t, I\u2019ll be honest,\u201d Leo said. \u201cIn juniors they put it on once, and we were pretty embarrassed at the time. We were around 17 years old. They razzed us a little bit, nothing crazy.\u201d \n \nThe story of how the Fitzgeralds landed in Hollywood might make a better movie than the ones they appeared in. \n \nJanet Fitzgerald said her sister thought the boys were adorable and urged her to submit photos to a Vancouver talent agency. So she did. A few weeks later, the agency invited them to a casting call in Vancouver for \u201cBaby Geniuses.\u201d The producers sought triplets or twins for the two leading toddler roles. \n \n\u201cWe went to the audition and thought nothing would happen,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the boys got called back for another interview and audition, and they got the part.\u201d \n \nFive months of filming in Southern California followed. (The sequel was shot in Vancouver.) Their mother said that Turner and her co-star Dom DeLuise were wonderful with the boys, and that she still kept in touch with Jimmy Wagner, a so-called Hollywood baby wrangler who helped the boys learn their dialogue. \n \nGerry remembers rehearsing lines for the second film with Voight in the star\u2019s trailer. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know who he was at the time,\u201d Gerry said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t very good at it because I was 7 years old, 8 years old. But looking back, it was pretty cool he kind of did that. I got the opportunity to sit down with Jon Voight, a pretty big star.\u201d \n \nBut hockey quickly consumed them. Leo took it up first, following their older brother Sheldon, and Gerry and Myles soon joined in. Their mother said she only recently repaired the broken windows and smashed stucco on their house, caused by thousands of pucks sailing high and wide of the net that the boys set up in their carport. She declined to identify the son who destroyed a living room window with a poorly aimed slap shot from the road. \n \n\u201cOur parents asked us if we wanted to keep trying the acting thing or play hockey,\u201d Myles said. \u201cObviously, we all wanted to play hockey. We were so young at the time to make a decision, but hockey is where we wanted to focus.\u201d \n \nAt Bemidji State, it did not take long for teammates and coaches to figure out how to tell the Fitzgeralds apart. (Leo and Myles are identical and Gerry is fraternal, their mother said.) Leo is the tallest, the only left-handed shot, and prefers a clear face shield on his helmet; the others wear the wire-cage style. \n \nSitting for an interview at the Sanford Center, Bemidji State\u2019s home rink, the Fitzgeralds subtly differentiated themselves. Leo and Gerry wore Bemidji hockey ball caps, Leo with the brim facing forward, Gerry\u2019s backward. Myles sported a Minnesota Twins cap. \n \n\u201cWhen they first came in, when I first saw them, it was kind of tough to tell who was who,\u201d Harms said. \u201cBut once you get to know them, they\u2019ve got three different personalities, three completely different guys. Leo is the most outgoing, for sure. Myles is a little bit quiet, and he\u2019s the smallest one, too. Gerry and Leo are a little similar.\u201d \n \nThe Beavers do not score a lot, instead relying on team defense and standout junior goalie Michael Bitzer. Bemidji State leads Division I in scoring defense at 1.79 goals allowed per game, and in penalty killing at 90 percent. \n \n\u201cEveryone knows their roles,\u201d Leo said. \u201cWe all come to the rink and want to work. We know what we\u2019ve got to do to win games.\u201d \n \nNo acting required.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Triplets at Bemidji State, once child actors, are stars on the ice","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Jackson","zipCode":"97502","state":"Oregon","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Central Point","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bend Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169668815","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2479"},"name":"Bend Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bendbulletin.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204956865","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Hashmi said authorities have told him it was too early to speculate. \n \n\u201cNone whatsoever right now,\u201d the center director said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any lead or information as to what started the fire and what happened. So I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be a few days, they told us, before they can come up with any answers for us.\u201d \n \nThe congregation\u2019s pastor, known as an imam, was awake in the early morning hours and checked online surveillance of the mosque and found no alarm active and the doors unlocked, Hashmi said. On Jan. 21, someone broke in and stole some electronics, including laptops. \n \n\u201cHe was worried about it and drove over there,\u201d Hashmi said. \u201cBy that time, fire engines were already there pouring water on the fire.\u201d \n \nThe structure was built in 2000. \n \nNo injuries were reported. It took about four hours to extinguish the blaze. \n \nHashmi, who\u2019s lived in Victoria 32 years, said the congregation of about 140 has had few other problems and has enjoyed support from the city of about 115 miles southwest of Houston. He already has received offers of temporary quarters for the congregation to worship. \n \n\u201cWhen 9/11 happened, Muslims and non-Muslims, we all got together,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, we will rebuild.\u201d \n \nThe Victoria Advocate on Saturday reported that in July 2013, a man admitted to painting \u201cH8,\u201d a computer shorthand for \u201chate,\u201d on the outside of the building. \n \nOn Jan. 7, a mosque under construction near Lake Travis in Austin was burned to the ground. \n \nThe Texas office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said like that blaze, it would monitor the investigation of the Victoria fire. \n \n\u201cBecause of growing anti-Muslim bigotry in our nation, and because of the recent spike in hate incidents targeting Islamic institutions and individuals, we urge investigators to keep the possibility of a bias motive for this fire in mind,\u201d CAIR-Houston Executive Director Mustafaa Carroll said. \n \nThere\u2019s been no determination yet for the Austin blaze, Diane Kanawati, with CAIR-Austin, said Saturday. \n \nIn December, a man was sentenced to four years in prison for setting fire to a Houston mosque where he worshipped. Gary Nathaniel Moore pleaded guilty to arson and using a fire as a deadly weapon in a Dec. 25, 2015, blaze that caused significant damage at the Islamic Society of Greater Houston mosque.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Austin news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"US: Texas mosque goes up in flames hours after Trump\u2019s Muslim ban","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Deccan Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169673440","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"137"},"name":"Deccan Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Global"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.deccanchronicle.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204957085","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:10Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there. For us it's an important time for our Prime Minister to show political leadership in this area.\"\n\nMany people he had spoken to that morning were feeling a sense of loss, he said. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Miki Perkins"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Somalia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Families split as Trump Muslim ban 'banishes normal, honest people'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2753","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Richmond","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Hawkesbury Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170618297","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"13"},"name":"Hawkesbury Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hawkesburygazette.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204959022","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:52Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/7fbc3373-3d41-4dde-80a2-4920951b021f.jpg/r1_0_727_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

That includes legal US residents temporarily out of the country.\n\nThe order has also barred all refugees from entering the US for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nAdditionally, Australian citizens who have travelled to the seven countries since March 1, 2011 are no longer eligible to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, and are now required to apply for a US visa.\n\nAustralians who are dual citizens of the nominated countries, including government officials, and \"have previously been issued an [Electronic System for Travel Authorisation] are likely to have the ESTA revoked\", according to the Australian government.\n\nNo travellers from Australia are known to have been immediately affected by the ban.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not received any requests for consular assistance from Australians unable to board transport to the United States,\" a spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said.\n\n\"The Australian embassy in Washington is engaging with US officials on the potential implications of the suspension for Australian travellers, including dual nationals.\n\n\"Travellers are advised that visa and other entry and exit conditions can change at short notice.\"\n\nQantas is advising anyone who thinks they may be affected to contact the airline directly or speak to their travel agent, and said it will provide affected passengers with a number of options, including a refund or a change of destination.\n\n\"Qantas notes the advice from the US government regarding tighter entry conditions,\" a spokesman for the airline said.\n\n\"We will reflect this change in our processes and booking systems, however it is not likely to materially impact Qantas passengers.\"\n\nIt is estimated 100 to 200 people who had already begun their journey when Mr Trump signed the order yesterday have been detained at US airports, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. An has temporarily stopped the government from sending those who landed with valid visas out of the country.\n\nCrowds of protesters have gathered at US airports in response to the order and subsequent detainments. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Pallavi Singhal"},"topics":[{"name":"Airline industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Qantas offers refunds to Australians affected by Trump's 'Muslim ban'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2753","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Richmond","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Hawkesbury Gazette","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170618297","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"13"},"name":"Hawkesbury Gazette","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.hawkesburygazette.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695204960744","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:11:47Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/9ee64257-56aa-4a23-82b6-0da54cb941ed.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

They keep going. We spoke about it before the game - winners find a way to win.\" \n\nThe result left Western Sydney in eighth spot, but still only two points outside the top six. \n\n\"To think we're going home with nothing is hard to believe. I thought we were good for at least a point, if not three,\" Wanderers coach Tony Popovic said. \n\nPerth coach Kenny Lowe was another manager scratching his head after Saturday's 2-0 loss to Central Coast. \n\nLowe blamed concentration lapses for the end of his side's five-game unbeaten stretch. \n\n\"We handed them two gifts,\" Lowe said. \n\n\"At the moment we're giving people chances to capitalise. They're not playing through us or hurting us, we're actually giving them goals ... it's not acceptable. \n\n\"The disappointing thing is that we're consistently inconsistent.\" \n\nGlory gloveman Liam Reddy is also set to be suspended for next week's home clash against Newcastle after copping a late red card for fouling Trent Buhagiar.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Steve Larkin"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Roar rise, other A-League contenders slip (AAP)","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Yahoo!

It will also block entry for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.  \n \nThough the crackdown was expected, US Homeland Security officials continued interviews of refugees held by Australia on Nauru as late as Friday. \n SHARE  Share on Facebook  SHARE  Share on Twitter  TWEET  Pin to Pinterest  PIN  Link   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has welcomed refugees since coming to office.  Photo: AP  \nMs Horrigan-Dixon received the medal of the Order of Australia in last week's Australia Day honours, recognition for more than 30 years of work to support waves of refugees arriving in Australia, including from Europe, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand. \n \nShe said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull should immediately explain how many people would go to the US. \n \n   \n\"Australia needs to start thinking about how we can work with local groups in Canada,\" she said.  \n \n\"The major problem remains the 1500-odd people being held on Manus Island and in Papua New Guinea, because no other country will accept them.  \n \n\"Justin Trudeau and his government have welcomed people. Maybe we need a delegation over there, and Australia could take people Canada would have otherwise taken to get people off these islands.\"   \n \nAn adviser to the St Mary's House of Welcome project in Fitzroy and founder of a series of local engagement and English-language programs, Ms Horrigan-Dixon said the Coalition and Labor had denied thousands of people the chance to build successful lives in Australia's cities and towns.  \n \nShe said the reinstatement of temporary protection visas by the Abbott government in 2013 meant many asylum seekers living in the community were in limbo, while those given permanent resettlement were thriving.  \n \n\"They want to be here and they want to work and settle. The thing they say they love the most is our democracy, our stable system of government and the inclusion and safety of Australia,\" Ms Horrigan-Dixon said.  \n \n\"What we set out to do is think how would we treat these people if they were our own children? \n \n\"Everything has been teamwork, because we've had a common cause.\" \n \nCanada has accepted 39,671 Syrians since November 2015. \n \n\"After these poor people have suffered for years on Manus and Nauru, they need to be somewhere welcoming and Justin Trudeau has shown he's prepared to provide that,\" she said.  \n \nFollow Tom McIlroy on","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Internet latest","group":"Internet"}],"title":"Negotiate with Trudeau for refugee resettlement, says advocate","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Sydney Morning Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587970","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Sydney Morning Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.smh.com.au/","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.facebook.com/tcmcilroy"],"sequenceId":"695204971457","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

USA TODAY NETWORK \n      \nProtesters at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Saturday. (Photo: Keldy Ortiz/NorthJersey.com) \n  \nProtests erupted at airports around the nation Saturday as Americans reacted in outrage to President Trump's sweeping order that banned people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. and suspended the nation's refugee program. \n \nMore than 120 people gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport clutching signs denouncing the executive order, alongside lawyers who rushed to airports to defend the rights of refugees, immigrants and green-card holders, among others, who were being detained and denied entry. \n \n\"This banning of people based on religion is not constitutional and it's not what we are about,\" said Yamandou Alexander of Jersey City, who hurried to Newark airport when he found out about the demonstration. \n \nAt the airport, attorneys stood by to help those in need. Attorney David A. Isaacson, who practices primarily immigration law in New York, said he learned of a Syrian citizen with a green card who arrived from Germany at around 4 p.m. was still begin questioned two hours later, as his daughter waited for him to be released. \n   \nUSA TODAY \n \nU.S. immigrants react to ban: 'Our president is trying to divide us' \n    \nUSA TODAY \n \nCourt grants temporary, emergency stay of Trump's immigration ban \n  \nA Rutgers student who went to visit her ill mother in Syria and was on her way back also was having problems getting back into the country, said attorney Ayanna Lewis-Gruss. She said the student\u2019s host family reached out to attorneys at the airport after the woman was stopped on a layover in Paris and was not allowed to fly to Newark. \n \nThe protests on Saturday were organized spontaneously and grew throughout the day as news spread about the far-reaching impact of Trump's order. There were reports about legal residents detained at borders, stranded in other countries and in some cases deported. At the same time, refugees who had gone through years-long approvals to come to the U.S. were also being barred. As word spread, protests were organized too in other cities including Chicago, Denver and Dallas, as well as Dulles airport in northern Virginia. \n \nProtesters in Newark cheered around 9 p.m. ET after hearing that a federal court judge in Brooklyn had granted an emergency stay that put Trump's executive order on hold. The judge's order barred officials from deporting approved refugees and anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from one of the seven countries singled out in the ban. It was unclear how quickly the order might affect people in detention. \n     \nAutoplay \n \nShow Thumbnails \n \nShow Captions \n  Last Slide Next Slide    \nAt John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, more than 1,000 people gathered by Saturday evening as word spread of the protest. \n \n\"I was in disbelief. I just had to jump in my car and head out here,\" said Hillary Frileck, of Brooklyn. \n \n\"This is what really scares me. This resonates with me. One person (who was detained) works for us. These people have visas. It's important for us to speak up. We have to rise up. We can't just lay on our couches and think things will be OK.\" \n \nEmily Witt of Brooklyn said she viewed the ban as a \"bad moral decision\" especially given that it was Holocaust Remembrance Day. \n \n\"Like everyone else, I'm just shocked and afraid,\" she said. \"I didn't think I would see this. It's a rebuke to us. Once you start registering people because of their beliefs, it's the first step toward a country that goes against American values, where our right to free speech and freedom of religion and freedom of expression is threatened.\" \n \nSara Cullinane, director of Make The Road New Jersey, which organized the demonstration in the Newark, said they chose the airport because it's one of the hubs for the arrival of refugees  who are then relocated to different parts of the country. \n \n\"We are all learning about the order means and how it will be interpreted,\" she said. \n \nIn Chicago, thousands of demonstrators gathered at O'Hare International Airport to protest the Trump order. \n \nMatt Pryor, a spokesman with the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) said more than a dozen people, including several with green cards, were detained at O'Hare International Airport as a result of Trump's executive order. \n \nAfter the stay was issued in New York, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called on the federal government to immediately release those being detained in his city. \n \nAt 10:21 pm, IRAP attorneys said every traveler at O'Hare held under the Trump order had been released. \n \nPryor said IRAP attorneys identified one Syrian woman who arrived in Chicago and was stopped by immigration officials and sent back to Saudi Arabia, where she currently lives, before a U.S. district judge in New York issued a stay Saturday night, preventing such deportations. \n \nThe woman, who had a visa, came to visit her mother in Indiana, who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and was recovering after surgery. \n \nAt Los Angeles International Airport, bewildered travelers carrying their luggage stared at the nearly 200 protesters, who shouted, \"No Trump, No KKK, No fascist USA,\" as they entered the Tom Bradley International Terminal. \n \nMohammed Al Rawi, 34, of Long Beach was among the protesters. \n \nAl Rawi said his father, Qassim, was traveling from Baghdad to Qatar and was about to board a plane headed to Los Angeles when he was stopped by a representative of the airline. \n \n\"That gentleman took his passport and then they came back with an American gentleman who introduced himself as a representative of the U.S. Embassy in Qatar and told him his visa is no longer valid,\" Al Rawi said. \n \nAl Rawi said his father and 30 other passengers were placed in a room for over 10 hours. His father was then sent on a plane back to Baghdad. \n \n\"He is just exhausted and devastated,\" Al Rawi said. \"He was very excited to see his grandchildren. ... He hasn't seen them in almost two years.\" \n \nAt least 40 people gathered Saturday night at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix to stand in solidarity with individuals arriving from London on a British Airways flight. \n \nSky Harbor officials declined to say whether any immigrants had been detained at the Phoenix airport, referring information requests to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Officials at the federal agency could not be reached for comment Saturday. American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona officials said they were not aware of anyone being detained at Sky Harbor. \n \nJill Bernstein said she got home from errands Saturday afternoon and saw news of people protesting at JFK International Airport in New York and decided to invite 250 people on Facebook to join her at the gate of the international flight into Phoenix. She said she didn't even know most of the people who joined her. \n \n\"I just figured if we don't stand up whenever we have the opportunity to stand up then we are screwed,\" Bernstein said. \n \nThe group grew by two or three people every few minutes over an hour. The British Airways flight landed at 6:20 p.m. \n \nSome passengers walking by the group gave shouts of solidarity to the protesters, while others shouted support for Trump. \n \nRobert Burridge, 74, walked to the crowd and began crying. He had just returned from Mexico and said he wished he had been in the U.S. to be part of the marches following Trump's inauguration. \n \n\"Walking into this is so unexpected,\" Burridge said. \"I'm so proud to be here again.\" \n \nHannan Adely and Keldy Ortiz report for The (Bergen County, N.J.)

GARDAÍ have appealed for witnesses after a young man died in a collision between a car and a coach on the Mallow-Killarney road in north Cork. The collision, which occurred shortly before 6.30pm yesterday evening, resulted in the entire road being closed. Both vehicles collided some 4km outside Mallow, not far from the Cork Racecourse site.\n\nThe young man, the driver and sole occupant of the car, suffered multiple injuries in the collision and died before he could be transferred to Cork University Hospital (CUH). It is understood the 21 year old worked in the equestrian industry and was from the north Cork area. The coach driver, a middle-aged man, was taken to CUH for assessment as a precautionary measure. The three passengers were unhurt and did not require hospital treatment. Mallow Gardaí have now appealed for anyone who may have witnessed the collision to contact them to assist their investigation.\n\n\"The stretch of road is currently closed to facilitate a Garda Forensic Collision Examination. Local diversions are in place,\" a garda spokesman said. \"Investigating Gardaí are appealing for witnesses. Anyone with information is asked to contact Mallow Garda Station on 022- 31450 the Garda Confidential Line 1800 666 111 or any Garda Station.\" Gardaí said the identity of the deceased will only be confirmed when all relatives have been notified.\n\nThe Office of the Cork Coroner has been notified and a post mortem examination is expected to be conducted at CUH tomorrow morning.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Ralph RiegelTwitterEmail"},"topics":[],"title":"21-year-old equestrian worker killed after car collides with coach","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"IE","country":"Ireland"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Irish Independent","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660181","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"290"},"name":"Irish Independent","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://independent.ie"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.carsireland.ie/","http://www.carsireland.ie/index.php","http://www.carsireland.ie/car-dealers/","http://www.irishjobs.ie/?cid=Partner_INM_JobSearchBoxUrl","http://www.themeetingpoint.ie/?utm_source=independent&utm_campaign=navbar&utm_term=unknown","http://www.themeetingpoint.ie/mature-dating/?utm_source=independent&utm_campaign=navbar&utm_term=unknown","http://www.themeetingpoint.ie/gay-dating/?utm_source=independent&utm_campaign=navbar&utm_term=unknown","http://www.inotices.ie/","http://www.inotices.ie/death-notices","https://www.fitlive.ie/","https://www.fitlive.ie/events/","https://www.fitlive.ie/training/","https://www.hotelscombined.ie/?a_aid=143290&label=Hotels-tab","https://www.clickandgo.com/special-offers?utm_source=HolidayDeals&utm_medium=Content&utm_term=HolidayDeals&utm_content=HolidayDeals&utm_campaign=HolidayDeals%20Link","https://www.facebook.com/Independent.ie","https://twitter.com/Independent_ie","https://plus.google.com/116623388763634190489","https://twitter.com/@ralphriegel","http://livefyre.com/","http://livefyre.com/?ref_noscript","http://www.farmireland.ie/","http://www.inm.ie/contact/","http://www.inm.ie/"],"sequenceId":"695204983856","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:28:39Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article35406529.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/n72.jpg"},{"url":"http://cdn-01.independent.ie/incoming/article35406529.ece/6cf81/AUTOCROP/w620h342/n72.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

This has been in effect since 1 January 2016, although some of it only provisionally because ratification by the Netherlands is still outstanding. \n \n\u201cFirstly, the \u201cUkraine Model\u201d corresponds to the British objectives in that it contains substantial market access but does not require the application of EU law or compliance with the case law of the ECJ, nor does it provide for free movement but it does allow free trade agreements with third countries. Thus the United Kingdom\u2019s four key requirements are met.\u201d \n \nHere is the CEP\u2019s table, illustrating the benefits of a Ukraine-style deal: \n \nCentre for European Policy \n  \nThe think-tank does acknowledge that issues could arise with a Ukraine-style deal for the UK, particularly when it comes to the financial services sector \u2014 which has been one of the most contentious issues since the Brexit vote. \n \nBanks currently have the right to \u201cpassport\u201d their financial licences in one EU market to another, preventing them having to go through the costly and complicated process of being regulated in each market where they operate, but that passport could be lost after the Brexit process has been completed, causing chaos for Britain\u2019s financial services industry. \n \nRoughly  13,500 companies use financial passporting  in relation to the UK with all types of businesses from newspapers to removals companies, all the way to a body that represents acupuncturists holding passports. \n \n\u201cThe agreement with the Ukraine is unlikely to satisfy the United Kingdom as regards the scope of trade liberalisation because it contains numerous restrictions on market access particularly for cross-border services. The United Kingdom will probably require better access to the EU internal market, primarily in the interests of the British finance industry,\u201d the report notes. \n \nThat\u2019s where the \u201cPlus\u201d comes in, with the UK creating a bespoke deal that includes many of the features of the Ukrainian agreement, but also includes concessions to the banking and finance sectors.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Will Martin"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"European Union news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Eastern Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Ukraine news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Britain could strike a \u2018Ukraine Plus\u2019 style Brexit deal","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"ID","country":"Indonesia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"BusinessInsider.co.id","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"536287470","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"51"},"name":"BusinessInsider.co.id","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society","Politics"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.businessinsider.co.id"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.cep.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/cep.eu/Studien/cepAdhoc_Brexit/cepAdhoc_Ukraine_Plus_as_a_model_for_Brexit.pdf","http://uk.businessinsider.com/morgan-stanley-on-brexit-uk-canada-plus-2017-1","http://uk.businessinsider.com/theresa-may-brexit-speech-leaving-single-market-immigration-control-2017-1","http://uk.businessinsider.com/brexit-eu-financial-passport-city-of-london-2016-11"],"sequenceId":"695205002285","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The Bucks have lost three in a row and eight of nine. \n\nBoston built a six-point lead in overtime, but Tony Snell hit consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 108. Crowder made two free throws on the ensuing possession with 28 seconds to go and two more to seal it with 10 seconds left after Antetokounmpo missed a contested shot in the lane. \n\nThe Celtics got out to a double-digit lead quickly and never gave it up. Crowder scored eight of the Celtics' first 11 points to help Boston get out to a nine-point lead in the first 21/2 minutes. \n\nThat was just the beginning of what ended up as a 42-point first quarter for the Celtics. With Crowder leading the way with 11 points and Thomas chipping in 10, the Celtics picked apart the Bucks' defense on the way to 63.2 percent shooting from the field in the period in addition to 11-of-11 shooting from the free-throw line. Gerald Green put the exclamation point on the quarter by making a 25-footer before the buzzer that gave the Celtics a 42-27 lead after 12 minutes. \n\nIn that opening stanza, the Bucks got nothing from Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker. Milwaukee's leading scorers combined to go 0-of-8 from the field as Michael Beasley shouldered the scoring load off the bench with 11 points. \n\nAntetokounmpo made his first three shots of the second quarter, including a pair of dunks, to highlight an 8-0 run that brought the Bucks within eight, but that was as close as they would get. That's because Thomas subbed back in and went on a tear. He got fouled shooting a 3-pointer and made all three free throws, made a 26-footer and a 30-footer and hooked a left-handed layup over Snell on the way to scoring 13 points in the final six minutes of the second quarter, putting him at 23 at the half.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MATT VELAZQUEZMilwaukee Journal Sentinel"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: NBA - Milwaukee Bucks news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: NBA - Boston Celtics news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NBA news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: basketball news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest scores","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Thomas shines again as Celtics hold off Bucks for 112-108 OT win","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"San Luis Obispo","zipCode":"93401","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"San Luis Obispo","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"San Luis Obispo.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659768","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"316"},"name":"San Luis Obispo.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Basketball","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sanluisobispo.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695205002455","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Join The Roar for live scores and coverage from 7:30pm (AEDT). \n \nIt\u2019s been dubbed the Throwback Open, and it\u2019s hard to argue after Serena Williams beat Venus Williams on Saturday in the women\u2019s final, and now we have one of the greatest rivalries lining up for a crack at the men\u2019s final. \n \nSince their first meeting in 2004, the pair have played a staggering 36 times, but it\u2019s Nadal who holds all the cards with 25 wins. \n \nIt also includes all three meetings at the Australian Open, including the epic 2009 final when he won in five sets. \n \nWhile Nadal does hold the edge historically, six years of age won\u2019t help him recover from what was an incredible semi-final against 15th seed Grigor Dimitrov. \n \nDimitrov stepped it up to play possibly his best match ever despite losing, Nadal eventually winning in a staggering five hours of tennis. \n \nIt was a marathon for Nadal and his second brutal five-set match of the tournament after being taken all the way by Alexander Zverev in the third round. \n \nFederer has also played two five-set matches throughout the tournament, but they were shorter against Kei Nishikori and Stan Wawrinka and he has had an extra day to recover. \n \nThe biggest problem for Federer has been his consistency from one set to the next, and it\u2019s something he must get right against Nadal, because the momentum won\u2019t be turned as easily. \n \nNonetheless, he has been using every offensive weapon in his toolkit and playing some absolutely fantastic tennis. \n \nThat\u2019s not to say Nadal hasn\u2019t played high quality tennis because he most certainly has. The semi-final against Dimitrov was one of the best matches across the tournament and the way he blew Milos Raonic off the court in the quarter-final was fantastic. \n \nPrediction \nWhatever happens, let\u2019s hope for an absolute classic. Federer and Nadal are two of the greatest ever and it could well be the last time they square off in a grand slam final. \n \nAs for the actual prediction \u2013 Nadal will be fatigued after his five-hour semi-final battle, but has the edge over Federer.

The leaders discussed a wide range of global and international issues in a \"positive and business-like atmosphere\" and agreed to keep in touch, the Kremlin press service said. \n \n\"The positive call was a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair,\" the White House said in a statement , commenting on the results of the conversation. \n Partners in the struggle against terror  \nThe two leaders discussed in detail \"pressing international problems,\" including the developments in the Middle East, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the strategic stability and non-proliferation, the situation around Iran\u2019s nuclear program and the Korean Peninsula, the Kremlin said in a statement. \"The key aspects of the Ukrainian crisis have been touched upon as well. It has been agreed to establish partner-type cooperation in those and other areas,\" the statement reads. \n \nPutin and Trump placed a special emphasis on the fight against terrorism. \"The presidents spoke in favor of creating real coordination of Russian and American actions with a purpose to defeat the ISIL (the former name of the Islamic State) and other terrorist groups in Syria,\" the Kremlin statement reads. \n \nAlexei Pushkov, a member of the Defense and Security Committee of the Federation Council, wrote in his Twitter account that discussing coordination in anti-terrorism efforts \"represents a qualitative change\" in bilateral ties, while the first deputy chairman of this committee, Frants Klintsevich said the Islamic State will literally see its last days if Moscow and Washington join forces. \n  \nБеседа Путина и Трампа оправдала надежды: прошла со знаком плюс, став прологом к личной встрече. Координация в борьбе с ИГ- качеств. сдвиг. \n\u2014 Алексей Пушков (@Alexey_Pushkov) 28 января 2017 г.  \nThe head of the State Duma International Affairs Committee said the declared intention to coordinate anti-terrorism effort was the most important result of the talk. \"The main result of the first talk between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump was an agreement to coordinate efforts to defeat the IS. This is what the entire clear-headed world is expecting from the Russian-U.S. relations,\" Leonid Slutsky said. \n \nLawmaker Nikolai Kovalev, who formerly headed Russia\u2019s security service FSB, named \"coordination of efforts in Syria, joining forces, exchange of information\" and an end to U.S. weapon supplies to the Syrian opposition as the first practical steps that the U.S. may make in the declared joint Russian-U.S. antiterrorism struggle. He said Washington previously refused to cooperate with Moscow on the issue, but \"this situation may now change drastically.\" \n Business ties  \nPutin and Trump also discussed restoring trade and economic ties, that could \"further stimulate consecutive and sustainable development of bilateral relations.\" \n \nKirill Dmitriev, who heads the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), said the results of the first official contact between the presidents of Russia and the United States send a positive signal to investors. \"Placing the emphasis on restoring trade and economic cooperation is very important,\" he said. \n  The RDIF CEO added that the fund has designed ten Russian-U.S. priority investment projects and will present them to the U.S. partners for a preliminary discussion soon. \nThe head of the State Duma\u2019s committee on science and education, Vyacheslav Nikonov, also pointed at the economic part of the discussion. He said that the declared readiness to restore trade and economic ties \"may envisage a partial cancellation of sanctions.\" \n \n\"Of course, the word \u2018sanctions\u2019 was left out, but restoring trade and economic ties stipulates that this issue has to be approached as well,\" said the lawmaker, who is also a prominent Russian expert on foreign affairs. \n First step  \nRussian politicians were overly positive about the results of the first Putin-Trump talk after the transition of power in the United States. \n \n\"Naturally, a phone conversation between the two presidents is not enough to solve all problems in the Russian-U.S. relations , which had been accumulating for years. But the first step has undoubtedly been made,\" senator Klintsevich said, adding that Trump appeared to be taking cooperation with Russia seriously. However, he warned against jumping into optimistic conclusions before the US makes its first practical steps. \n \nKonstantin Kosachev, who heads the International Affairs Committee of the Russian parliament\u2019s upper house, said the phone conversation apparently \"returned sense and reason\" into the Russian-U.S. dialogue. \"Hopefully, behind the laconic mention of the matters discussed, there is determination - bilateral determination, not only on our behalf - to introduce the new format of relationship, the relations of partnership instead of rivalry,\" he said. \n \nVyacheslav Nikonov also described the phone talk as \"a very good start.\" \"They set the bar very high at the talks,\" he said. \"The fact that they managed to discuss this (wide range of issues) in 45 minutes means that there were no major disagreements.\" \n \nSource","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Putin, Trump seek to give fresh start to ailing Russian-U.S. ties \u2013 experts","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"RU","country":"Russia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Russia Beyond The Headlines","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"557373897","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Russia Beyond The Headlines","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://rbth.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://rbth.com/news/2017/01/28/putin-trump-agreed-to-keep-in-touch-regularly-during-phone-call-kremlin_691176","http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/53787","https://twitter.com/Alexey_Pushkov/status/825441205538390017","http://rbth.com/politics_and_society/2016/11/08/can-you-tell-the-difference-between-vladimir-putin-and-donald-trump_646005","http://rbth.com/tag/u.s.-russia%20relations","http://tass.com/","http://rbth.com/defence/2017/01/26/what-would-russian-american-cooperation-in-syria-look-like_689543"],"sequenceId":"695205006123","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:11:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Former captain Steve Waugh famously told his players in 2001 to immerse themselves in all that India has to offer, insisting that it would be a \"no-whinge tour\", a theme continued under Gilchrist in 2004 when he deputised for an injured Ricky Ponting. The approach was in contrast to the attitude taken by a key member of the 2013 tour who was privately dreading spending the next seven weeks on the road.\n\nGilchrist spoke to several of Australia's Test squad and backroom staff, including coach Darren Lehmann and batting coach Graeme Hick, when the side was in Perth recently for the one-day international against Pakistan. He told them \"attitude is all important\" for the seven-week tour. \"I was very much a follower and believer of most things Steve Waugh was talking to us about. I took that very much on board and tried to do that as much as possible, still do now. I find it a fascinating country,\" Gilchrist, who has business interests in India, told Fairfax Media.\n\n\"It's a country that weighs you down, too. You have highs and lows, it's an emotional roller-coaster, on the field and off the field. \"You've got to find a way to escape from it \u2013 if it's in your hotel room, but you don't want to become a prisoner to your hotel room, you have to get out there.\n\n\"It's [attitude] going to be a huge percentage of what's required. The ingredients to success is a positive attitude, not just positive like you have to use your feet and go after the spinner but everything.\"\n\nGilchrist said Waugh, in a bid to keep morale high, told the players at the start of the tour \"attitudes are contagious, is yours worth catching?\"\n\n\"From that, he extended it, saying this will be a 'no whinge tour',\" Gilchrist said. \"Forever we've come to India and we're beaten before we get here. We're whinging about the food, the conditions, the umpiring and the hotel room, the flights. We weren't allow to whinge, pretty much. It was amazing.\n\n\"It's a great question you can ask yourself every day: how you think is how you feel and that's how you're going to act, is yours worth catching? And that really helped. We didn't get the chocolates on that tour but it was a strong foundation to what lay ahead.\"\n\nAustralia's players were also given a mid-tour break between Tests in 2004, which allowed them to spend time in Singapore and the Maldives with family and partners. The current squad has been given time off between the second and third Tests but they will not be leaving the country. Smith has already foreshadowed a more defensive strategy with the bat.\n\n\"That allowed us to get into the game without being blown away and the deeper you take it the more chance you are,\" Gilchrist said. \"The tactics will be important.\" Gilchrist is drawing hope from England's strong start to their recent series against India where they fell just short of victory in the first Test. But he said it would be \"frightfully difficult\".\n\n\"There's no reason why they can't get there and start well and build up confidence and be competitive about challenging for the series,\" Gilchrist said.\n\n\"As is the way in India momentum swings, whether it's an innings, a Test or a series, once it's against you it's a hard freight train to stop.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrew Wu"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"'Attitude is all important': Gilchrist's advice on how to handle seven weeks in India","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4000","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Brisbane Adelaide Street","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Brisbane Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658354","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"191"},"name":"Brisbane Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Cricket","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://twitter.com/wutube","https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fsport%2Fcricket%2Findia-v-australia-test-series-adam-gilchrist-tells-australia-to-embrace-india-20170128-gu0q99.html&title=India+v+Australia+Test+series%3A+Adam+Gilchrist","https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fsport%2Fcricket%2Findia-v-australia-test-series-adam-gilchrist-tells-australia-to-embrace-india-20170128-gu0q99.html&text=India+v+Australia+Test+series%3A+Adam+Gilchrist+tells+Australia","https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fsport%2Fcricket%2Findia-v-australia-test-series-adam-gilchrist-tells-australia-to-embrace-india-20170128-gu0q99.html&title=India+v+Australia+Test+series%3A+Adam+Gilchrist+tells+Aust","http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fsport%2Fcricket%2Findia-v-australia-test-series-adam-gilchrist-tells-australia-to-embrace-india-20170128-gu0q99.html&title=India+v+Australia+Test+series%3A+Adam+Gil","http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brisbanetimes.com.au%2Fsport%2Fcricket%2Findia-v-australia-test-series-adam-gilchrist-tells-australia-to-embrace-india-20170128-gu0q99.html&title=India+v+Australia+Test+series%3A+Adam+Gilchrist+tells+Austr","http://www.facebook.com/brisbanetimes","https://twitter.com/brisbanetimes"],"sequenceId":"695205007915","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T20:21:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/content/dam/images/g/t/m/7/a/4/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gu0q99.png/1485667459566.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Court won 24 major titles in her 17-year career, 11 of them in the Open era. She won 64 grand slam titles in total, including doubles and mixed doubles.\n\n\"I think she will break the record, and I think she will break it soon,\" Court said.\n\n\"It's so much easier for players today to do what they do. She hadn't played for about three months before coming here, and it easier to do these things.\n\n\"But she's playing very well, and records are made to be broken. \"People keep asking me, 'How do you feel about your record?' but I'm not going to lose any sleep over something like that.\n\n\"My life is very busy and full, and they'll never get my 64 so it's all right. I'll always have that.\"\n\nCourt, who played from 1959 to 1975, watched Williams beat her sister Venus 6-4, 6-4 in the final and was again struck by the resources, support and equipment that players have access to.\n\n\"There was television in the early '60s but no sponsorship and money, none of that. Even the racquets they get to use today are so beautiful compared to what we used to have,\" she said.\n\n\"The facilities are so much better, they have massage people, they can bring psychologists with them as well as their trainers and coaches and whoever else they want to come along.\n\n\"It's a whole different era, so it's very hard to compare. I think back to our Aussie era where we had some of the greatest champions in the world and think, how did we ever do that?\"\n\nCourt has not had the chance to talk extensively with Williams, chatting to her briefly during a presentation at the 2016 Hopman Cup.\n\n\"It's like Fort Knox with the players today. They're so isolated and they're hard to talk to. It's not like when we played where everyone was like brother and sister, it's totally different.\n\n\"I thought it was a very interesting match that she played.

The weeks-long conflict had become one of the biggest internal challenges yet to Francis' efforts to modernize the 1.2 billion member Roman Catholic Church. \n \nAt issue was the Order's reaction to the discovery that condoms had been distributed by one of its aid projects in Myanmar. The Order had fired its Grand Chancellor, Albrecht Freiherr von Boeselager, whom it held responsible for the condom distribution. Von Boeselager declined to comment for this article. \n \nThough condom use goes against Catholic teaching, the Vatican had ordered an investigation into the firing of von Boeselager. It subsequently publicly castigated Festing, who had refused to cooperate with the investigation. \n \nBacking down, Festing, a former Sotheby's art auctioneer, gave a hand-written resignation letter to Francis in the pope's private residence, according to a senior Vatican source. Festing, who has the title of prince, declined an interview request. \n \nInstead of quelling the conflict, however, Festing's resignation was followed by yet another challenge to Francis' authority -- led by vocal pope critic American Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, according to Vatican and Knights sources. \n \nIn particular: Burke tried to convince Festing to withdraw his resignation and keep fighting the pope, these sources say. On Saturday, the Knight's Sovereign Council accepted Festing's resignation and re-instated von Boselager, a clear defeat for Burke. \n \nBurke declined to comment for this article. \n \nThe tussle suggested Francis is still battling to consolidate his power over the Church almost four years into his tenure, Vatican insiders say. \n \nBeyond a fight over condoms, the clash pointed to lingering divisions between the Church's conservatives and more progressive factions who support the pope's reformist agenda, they add. \n \nFrancis is trying to make the Church less dogmatic and more welcoming to whose who have felt excluded, such as homosexuals and the divorced. \n \n\"While this whole saga was an internal matter that probably should have stayed that way, it metamorphosed into a clash that showed the divide between conservatives and progressives,\" said Andrea Tornielli, author of several books on Pope Francis. \n \nThe Vatican declined to comment on the clash and on Pope Francis' efforts to consolidate his power. \n \nIt directed Reuters to two public statements. One, on Dec. 22, relates to the Vatican order to investigate the firing of von Boeselager. The second, on Jan. 17, followed a pledge by Festing on the Knights' web page not to cooperate with the Vatican. It decried his resistance and ordered members of the order to cooperate. \n \n    GERMAN ARISTOCRAT \n \nThe all-male top leaders of the Knights of Malta are not clerics, but they take vows of poverty, chastity and obedience to the pope. \n \nA German aristocrat whose father participated in a failed plot to kill Hitler in World War Two, von Boeselager was fired by Festing in December, and accused of having allowed the use of condoms while he was head of the Knights' global humanitarian projects. \n \nFesting fired him in Burke's presence, arguing that the German had hidden the condom use from the order's leaders when he was named Grand Chancellor, according to Knights and Vatican sources. \n \nImmediately, the firing set off the conflict between the Knights' hierarchy and the Vatican. \n \nVon Boeselager , a devout Catholic, said in a statement on Dec. 23 that he was fully behind Church teachings. He closed two projects in the developing world when he discovered condoms were being distributed but kept a third running in Myanmar for a while because closing it would have abruptly ended all basic medical services to poor people. \n \nThe Church does not allow condoms as a means of birth control and says abstinence and monogamy in heterosexual marriage is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. \n \n    In the same statement, von Boeselager said Festing and Burke told him the Vatican wanted him to resign and that there would be \"severe consequences\" for the Order if he did not. \n \nThe Vatican denied, in a letter from its secretary of state to the Order and seen by Reuters, that it had mandated the resignation, saying it had told the Knights the pope wanted a solution through dialogue. \n \nThe German said his sacking was against the Knights' constitution and appealed to the pope, who ordered the investigation. \n \nFesting refused to cooperate, issuing a series of increasingly strident public statements. In one, he called the papal commission that was investigating the firing \"legally irrelevant\". \n \nIn a Jan. 14 confidential letter to the top echelons of the order and seen by Reuters, Festing wrote: \"In refusing to acknowledge this group of people's jurisdiction, I am trying to protect the order's sovereignty\". \n \nThe institution has the status of a sovereign entity, maintaining diplomatic relations with over 100 states and the European Union and permanent observer status at the United Nations. \n \nThe pope was irritated by Festing's defiant stand, a senior Vatican source said, and the Vatican shot back with a public statement ordering the Knights to obey. \n \nAfter that public order, Festing changed his tune and resigned in the pope's residence a week later. \n \nFesting's resignation came as a shock for many inside the Knights: some of them told Reuters it was akin to the resignation of Pope Benedict in 2013. \n \nFour sources said that for many others in the order, it came as a relief. They feared the clash was damaging the image of the institution whose 13,000 members, 80,000 volunteers and 20,000 paid medical staff help the neediest around the world. \n \nThe day after Festing handed his resignation to the pope, Cardinal Burke drove to the order's headquarters from his apartment near the Vatican and sought to persuade Festing to withdraw his resignation, a source from the Vatican and one from the Knights said. \n \nBurke declined to comment on his meeting with Festing. \n \nBurke has long been leading challenges against the pope. Pope Francis demoted him from a top Vatican job in 2014 with no official explanation and assigned him to be the \"patron\" of the Order of Malta. \n \nSuch \"patron\" positions are usually given to older cardinals after they retire at 75. Burke was only 66 then and the demotion was widely seen as a sign of the pope's irritation with the cardinal's constant sniping over Francis\u2019 reforms. \n \nIn particular, Burke has contested moves by the pope that would allow Catholics who have divorced and re-married outside the Church without an annulment to return to the sacrament of communion. Burke declined to comment on his demotion. \n \nSince the demotion, Burke has become even more of a rallying point for conservatives, flying around the world to give lectures to conservative groups and often giving interviews criticising the pope's decisions. \n \nIn November, he led a rare public challenge to the pope with three other cardinals who accused the pontiff of sowing confusion on important moral issues such as that of communion for the divorced. \n \nBurke later said in an interview that if the pope did not respond to their letter, the cardinals might need to \"correct\" the pope themselves for the good of the Church. \n \nThe Vatican did not comment on the uprising at the time but many of the pope's supporters publicly criticised the four cardinals. \n \nThe pope will now appoint a \"pontifical delegate\" to help run the order, at least until elections can be held for a new Grand Master. \n \nIn a personal letter to the Sovereign Council on Jan. 27 and seen by Reuters, Francis made clear that the Vatican did not want to interfere with the Order's sovereignty but said his delegate would seek to \"renew the spirituality of the Order, specifically of those members who take vows.\" \n \n(Editing by Mark Bendeich, Philippa Fletcher and Alessandra Galloni)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Malta news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Italy news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Knights of Malta-Vatican feud - a tale of chivalry and sovereignty","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"SG","country":"Singapore"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Yahoo!

The document covers the technical issues involved in a meet and confer, with an emphasis on being prepared with a solid IG framework and numerous considerations around proportionality. \n\n\u201cThis guide represents years of hard-won practical experience and contains advice around implementing the latest changes to the FRCP,\u201d explains LTPI Board Member Quin Gregor. \u201cIn developing this, while we found a few frameworks, these were either too high level or too in the weeds. None of these laid our vision of how we thought the process should be addressed. With our focus on legal technology and its application our advice is naturally more on the practical than legal. However, we have represented the legal framework as much as we need to within the LTPI purview. We've all witnessed too many drive-by Meet & Confers when one sides ignorance of the process led to shoddy client representation. With this guide, there is no longer any excuse.\u201d\n\nThe guide is broken into 4 stages: pre-conference, activities at the conference, post conference, and \u201ccommon pitfalls\u201d, providing practical guidance and checklist items and related strategic considerations to streamline the process and avoid any missed steps.

But it's just one nip-slip away from wardrobe malfunction. Here's how to bare right... \n \nThere seems to be a celebrity cleavage competition going on. Recently, our most successful western export Priyanka Chopra took the 'golden' in Golden Globes literally by donning the shiny shade in a Ralph Lauren gown. Back home, Hollywood hopeful Deepika Padukone put the X in 'xXx' by following suit in a Naeem Khan. Even as the jury is out on who wore it best, many Indian celebrities have taken a leaf out of Kim Kardashian West's stylebook by wearing the daring neckline. If new mommy Kareena Kapoor Khan wore it post-baby bump in a sedate avatar, wunderkind Alia Bhatt styled her sternum in a golden blazer. And obviously our self-proclaimed fashion icon Sonam Kapoor had to show how it's done in a near-naked Yanina Couture gown. \n \n BARE BASICS \nCelebrity stylist and fashion designer Esha Amiin calls it \"the\" big trend for the red carpet - national or international. ''The plunging neckline is all about being sexy and sensual,'' she says and adds, ''However, one walks on a thin line with it as it could either swing towards a memorable look or towards vulgarity depending upon quite a few factors.'' Now the style is spilling over (ahem!) to everyday fashion too. Fashion and lifestyle blogger Akanksha Redhu says, ''You can even wear a top or bodysuit with a plunging neckline along with jeans.'' \nAmiin advises: ''If you are planning to wear a daring neckline you need three things - confidence, body type and, of course, double-sided tape.'' In fact, there are numerous tutorials on how to boob tape it, up a la Kardashian, available online for pointers. \n \n OFF YOUR CHEST \nAmiin is all for wearing it casually. ''Just use a deep neck body suit or lace ups and pair with denims. This look has the potential to go from a day look into a night look,'' she says. Bodysuits also work best as they keep the neckline pulled down and it doesn't get a chance to loosen up from anywhere and lead to a wardrobe malfunction. Redhu says that the best way to rock this look would be to accessorise it with a black choker, deep red lips, black booties, huge silver earrings and a bohemian cover-up, ''because we are in India and the men don't know how to control themselves here''. Point taken. \n \n   (Kangana Ranaut, Kareena Kapoor, Sonam Kapoor) \n \n SUIT YOURSELF \nThe plunging look works best on women with a more modest chest like Kangana Ranaut's. Rock a low cut for a day occasion by opting for a blazer minus \nthe shirt. \n \n BLING IT RIGHT \nDon't clutter or hide your neckline under some statement necklace like Priyanka Chopra. Best is to go for a choker or statement earrings so that the neckline gets the attention it deserves. \n \n BARE CHEST, BARE FACE \nKeep the makeup dewy or nude with just a hint of colour on the lips. A wet look with open hair like Alia Bhatt's, or hair tied up in a bun, works best. \n \n KEEP IT MINIMAL \nA plunging neckline is a statement in itself. Go with minimal accessories, maybe just a pair of elegant earrings and rings. But wear it with confidence and don't fumble like Deepika Padukone. \n \n CONTOUR RIGHT \nContour your chest to take the entire look to its full potential - like Kareena Kapoor. A plunging neckline is pointless if you have a pasty chest. If you have bumps or acne, cover it up with makeup. It will make the photos come out million times better. \n \n TAPE IT WELL \nA near nude look like Sonam Kapoor's requires a sound knowledge of boob tape and pasties.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Nupur Amarnath"},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer: fashion news","group":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"Taking the plunge","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Femina","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"378718959","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"121"},"name":"Femina","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Fashion","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://femina.in"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695205028845","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T18:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://static.femina.in/content/2017/Jan/881872photo.jpg"},{"url":"http://static.femina.in/content/2017/Jan/56806430.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The company produces the highest quality and largest quartz slabs in the industry. It distributes through many select locations in US and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. And is now expanding in California. \n\nThe demand for Quartz Master\u2019s Marble Collection prompted the company to open its first distribution center in California. In June 2016, Quartz Master opened its new 6500 square foot warehouse in Los Angeles to serve Los Angeles County. But within a couple of months, the distribution center was making deliveries to fabricators from as far south as San Diego to as far north as San Francisco.\n\nWhen it opened, the warehouse was stocked with a modest number of slabs, but within weeks it had to be restocked to meet demands. It now has millions in inventory. On January 2nd, they opened an office in San Diego, and on February 1st, an additional warehouse will open in San Francisco on Mariposa Avenue in Mountain View.\n\nQuartz Master is recognized for its Marble Collection. In 2011, after 12 months of laborious engineering, Quartz Master introduced the world\u2019s first marble design to Quartz. And in 2014, they perfected the art of book matching. Today, most all of their marble designs are book matched. Homeowners and interior designers appreciate the low maintenance, durability and unmatched stain resistance of quartz. And they love that they can design a kitchen that has the beauty of natural stone without the expense and hassle.\n\nTo meet demand and high-quality customer service, Quartz Master will have representatives throughout the state, who will supply showrooms, interior designers, and fabricators with samples and customer service.\n\nAbout Quartz Master \n\nQuartz Master is a world\u2019s experts of quartz surfaces.

Robertson, a young pioneer woman named Kallie sets out for a new life with her husband\u2019s family along the Oregon Trail, only for all her plans to be pulled out from under her when their caravan is attacked and her husband murdered. \n   \nTaken captive by an Indian warrior, Kallie must rely on her stubborn inner strength and knowledge of healing to survive in a strange world of war bands, buffalo hunting and hidden dangers. Her struggle for survival and eventual surrender to passion for her captor, Brave Eagle, drives the adventure of \u201cCrossing at Sweet Grass.\u201d \n   \nFirst, the elephant in the room: yes, this entire premise can generously be called dated. Less generously: racist. There\u2019s a small sub-genre of romances with basically this same plot, following the archaic \u201ccaptivity narrative\u201d of the 17th to 19th centuries, and even the best of them toe some very uncomfortable lines of cultural fetishism, imperialist grandstanding and stereotypes. \n   \n\u201cCrossing at Sweet Grass\u201d is not among the best. Its depiction of Brave Eagle\u2019s generically tribal band is not malicious, but it does fall into several stereotypical tropes ranging from \u201cnoble savage\u201d to \u201csavage monster\u201d that are uncomfortable to find in a novel from 2016. That all the Native characters have names like Flaming Arrow, Pretty Shield and Weasel Tail is the least of it. \n   \nAnd, to be fair, the white characters aside from Kallie herself don\u2019t fare much better. Most are flat at best, save Kallie\u2019s shrewish sister-in-law, who is captured alongside her and often exemplifies the worst of the decidedly non-civilized civilization they\u2019ve left behind. However, she also seems to have been included in the story just to spare Kallie the worst of the captivity narrative (including multiple rapes) and the narrative spares her little sympathy in that regard. \n   \nIt\u2019s also a self-published book, Robertson\u2019s first, and this is unfortunately obvious from certain weaknesses in pacing and style. The first 15 pages alone contain enough plot points for the first half of a novel, including the aforementioned massacre, three escape attempts, two bathing voyeurism scenes, at least one rape and a lot of backstory. Each of these are addressed in a single paragraph at most, leaving no room for \u201cshow,\u201d only tell. Hardly the most engaging. \n   \nOn the positive side, the style gets much better as the story goes on. By about the halfway point, the scenes are allowed to be scenes with pacing and subtly and emotional impact, to the point that a reader can come to genuinely care for the main leads despite their rather flat and/or stereotypical personalities. \n   \nAlso, unlike a lot of romances, there\u2019s enough going on that the story feels active and even somewhat dense for a 240-page run. The result is ultimately a more satisfying read than, say, your average Nicholas Sparks novel. It\u2019s just a shame that so much of the good is lost in unfortunate implications and a very under-developed first half. \n   \n\u201cCrossing at Sweet Grass\u201d is available online or at Gulliver\u2019s Books in Fairbanks. \n   \nAddley Fannin is a freelance writer with a master\u2019s degree in Northern studies from the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

Baltimore County Police are now trying to piece together the timelines of two fatal accidents. \n \nA crumpled bicycle is now haunting evidence of a crash that killed a boy in Randallstown. The first crash happened just before 9 p.m. near Marriottsville Road. Early investigating revealed that a 19-year-old woman and a 14-year-old boy were riding together on one bicycle west on Liberty Road. They were struck by a 2002 Nissan Ultima, also traveling west on Liberty Road. \n \nThe 14-year-old boy, Jamal Quentin Anderson from Randallstown died from his injuries from the crash. \n \nRELATED:  14-Year-Old Boy Killed In Bike-Car Crash, Police Believe Driver Was Drunk \n \nThe young woman he was with was transported to an area hospital with life-threatening injuries. She is in stable condition at last report. \n \nThe driver of the Nissan remain at the scene and has been identified as Conrad Oliver Antonio Thorpe, 23, from Randallstown. He has been charged with driving under the influence and is being held at the Baltimore County Detention Center without bail. \n \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to happen. This absolutely could have been avoided. If he hadn\u2019t been drunk at the time, you have to ask yourself: would he have seen them? Would he have been paying more attention?\u201d says Officer Jennifer Peach, with Baltimore County Police. \n \n\u201cRight now we\u2019re trying to review any video footage that we have from any of the stores along Liberty Road to see if we can get an image of them on the bike,\u201d says Officer Peach. \n \nThe second crash happened just before midnight on Liberty Road at Offutt Road when a red 2012 Hyundai Tucson traveling east suddenly crossed over the center line and collided head-on with an MTA transport van heading west. \n \nThe only passenger in the van was transported to an area hospital for treatment of minor injuries. The driver was also transported to an area hospital as a precaution but has been released from the hospital. \n \nThe driver of the Hyundai has been identified as William Thomas Rideout, 44 from Randallstown. He was transported to Northwest Hospital where he was pronounced dead. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s possible he could have had some kind of medical emergency happen. He could have fallen asleep. At this point, we just don\u2019t know,\u201d says Officer Peach. \n \nNow, investigations continue to look into a pair of tragic encounters, that claimed two lives. \n \nThe speed limit the area along Liberty Road where the incidents occurred is 40 MPH. That, and the fact that there are no bike lanes may play a part in the investigations. \n \nFollow @CBSBaltimore on","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: movie news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Teen Boy, Man Die In 2 Accidents, Hours Apart On Liberty Rd.","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Baltimore","zipCode":"21117","state":"Maryland","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Owings Mills","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WJZ","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658486","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3222"},"name":"WJZ","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer","Film"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wjz.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://cbsloc.al/2k4LC9i","https://twitter.com/cbsbaltimore","https://www.facebook.com/CBSBaltimore"],"sequenceId":"695205033772","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:00:08Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:33:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://cbsbaltimore.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/5c29e20bf3a14ab3b6c02d42c836f98c.jpg?w=300"}],"video":[]}}

From Somalia, to her last home in India, and now Texas, the state that abuts another Trump target: Mexico.\n\nMr Haraco, secretary of the Somali Australian Council of Victoria, doesn't know if he should book tickets or wait to see what unfolds when the 90-day period ends.\n\nWill the ban continue? When will he see his elderly mother-in-law again? She is over 70 now; he doesn't want to leave it too long.\n\nConfusion and concern among immigrants and refugee advocates has been widespread, with travellers detained or sent home from US airports.\n\nThere is confusion, too, among the young men that Mr Haraco has brought down to the ocean to mull over the qualities of a leader.\n\nSome have talked about finding it difficult to get a job in Melbourne because of the colour of their skin, or their religion.\n\nThe group also discussed gangs, and young people they know who are dropping out of school, drawn to these groups.\n\nBut the bigger purpose was to inspire them, says council member Abdi Aziz, and he remains convinced that Trump's ruling won't quash their enthusiasm for multiculturalism.\n\n\"Diversity is mainstream in Australia \u2026 but the risk is there.

The approach was in contrast to the attitude taken by a key member of the 2013 tour who was privately dreading spending the next seven weeks on the road.\n\nGilchrist spoke to several of Australia's Test squad and backroom staff, including coach Darren Lehmann and batting coach Graeme Hick, when the side was in Perth recently for the one-day international against Pakistan. He told them \"attitude is all important\" for the seven-week tour.\n\n\"I was very much a follower and believer of most things Steve Waugh was talking to us about. I took that very much on board and tried to do that as much as possible, still do now. I find it a fascinating country,\" Gilchrist, who has business interests in India, told Fairfax Media.\n\n\"It's a country that weighs you down, too. You have highs and lows, it's an emotional roller-coaster, on the field and off the field.\n\n\"You've got to find a way to escape from it \u2013 if it's in your hotel room, but you don't want to become a prisoner to your hotel room, you have to get out there.\n\n\"It's [attitude] going to be a huge percentage of what's required. The ingredients to success is a positive attitude, not just positive like you have to use your feet and go after the spinner but everything.\"\n\nGilchrist said Waugh, in a bid to keep morale high, told the players at the start of the tour \"attitudes are contagious, is yours worth catching?\"\n\n\"From that, he extended it, saying this will be a 'no whinge tour',\" Gilchrist said. \"Forever we've come to India and we're beaten before we get here. We're whinging about the food, the conditions, the umpiring and the hotel room, the flights. We weren't allow to whinge, pretty much. It was amazing.\n\n\"It's a great question you can ask yourself every day: how you think is how you feel and that's how you're going to act, is yours worth catching? And that really helped. We didn't get the chocolates on that tour but it was a strong foundation to what lay ahead.\"\n\nAustralia's players were also given a mid-tour break between Tests in 2004, which allowed them to spend time in Singapore and the Maldives with family and partners. The current squad has been given time off between the second and third Tests but they will not be leaving the country. Smith has already foreshadowed a more defensive strategy with the bat.\n\n\"That allowed us to get into the game without being blown away and the deeper you take it the more chance you are,\" Gilchrist said. \"The tactics will be important.\" Gilchrist is drawing hope from England's strong start to their recent series against India where they fell just short of victory in the first Test. But he said it would be \"frightfully difficult\".\n\n\"There's no reason why they can't get there and start well and build up confidence and be competitive about challenging for the series,\" Gilchrist said.\n\n\"As is the way in India momentum swings, whether it's an innings, a Test or a series, once it's against you it's a hard freight train to stop.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrew Wu"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"'Attitude is all important': Gilchrist's advice on how to handle seven weeks in India","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"6004","state":"Western Australia","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"East Perth","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"WA Today","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169588399","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"27"},"name":"WA Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Cricket","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.watoday.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695205052073","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:34:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

a hundred people who were detained in United States airports were spared immediate deportation after a federal judge ruled that sending travellers home could cause the \"irreparable harm\" lawyers say\n\nThe lawyers sued to block President Donald Trumps\u2019 order to block Syrian refugees from entering the US\n\nMr Trump on Friday signed an executive order stopping refugees fleeing killings in Syria to from entering the US indefinitely\n\nThe order which he said will keep \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from entering the country will also give priority entry attention to Christians and other minority religious groups from predominantly Muslim countries like Somalia Sudan Libya Iran Syria Iraq and Yemen\n\n\"We don\u2019t want them here We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people\" he said\n\nBut on Saturday volunteer lawyers were frantically rushing to airports across the country to give legal aid to refugees trapped by the order and awaiting deportation\n\nAnn Donnelly a judge of the District Court in Brooklyn New York ruled around 9 pm local time stopping the implementation of the order The government was \"enjoined and restrained from in any manner and by any means removing individuals\" already in the US with valid visas and refugee status\n\nThe ruling however did not appear to stop the Trump administration from stopping those who are yet to enter US territory\n\nThe judge gave the one-page ruling after the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU a nonpartisan human rights organisation told the court that one of the refugees detained at an airport was being put in a plane to be deported to Syria\n\nAccording to the New York Times hundreds of protesters had gathered outside the court chanting \"set them free\"\n\nMinutes after the New York\u2019s ruling another judge in the Federal District Court of Virginia handed another ruling temporarily stopping the deportation of any green card holder being detained at Dulles International Airport\n\n\"We\u2019ve gotten reports of people being detained all over the country They\u2019re literally pouring in by the minute\" Becca Heller the director of the International Refugee Assistance Project told the New York Times\n\nBut Mr Trump doesn\u2019t appear to be perturbed by the chaotic scenes at the country\u2019s airports\n\n\"It\u2019s not a Muslim ban but we were totally prepared It\u2019s working out very nicely You see it at the airports you see it all over\" he said at the White House\n\nSeveral legal residents of the US who holds green cards were being stopped in foreign airports as they return from funerals vacations or study abroad the New York Times claimed\n\nOn Saturday American Homeland Security said 109 people who were already in transit to the US when the order came into effect were not allowed into the country It also stated that 173 people were stopped from boarding planes heading to the US However 81 who were stopped eventually got waivers to enter the US Iran bans US Citizens\n\nMeanwhile Iran has responded to the ban on its citizens from entering the US with a ban of its own\n\n\"While respecting the American people and distinguishing between them and the hostile policies of the US government Iran will implement the principle of reciprocity until the offensive US limitations against Iranian nationals are lifted\" a Foreign Ministry statement said\n\n\"The restrictions against travel by Muslims to America are an open affront against the Muslim world and the Iranian nation in particular and will be known as a great gift to extremists\" the statement

overseer of Omega Fire Ministries Worldwide Apostle Johnson Suleman has successfully thrust himself into the limelight like he has always craved Pastors and \"Men of God\" in Nigeria are a curious breed \n\nThey wear the best suits ride in luxury cars reside in exotic homes spew fake prophecies every other December and threaten fire and brimstone on just about everyone Here's a caveat--not all Nigerian Pastors fit the above description play But there are those whose laps need to be sat on so that they can show you a level of grace you do not understand those who ask Church members to\"kill him and spill his blood on the ground\" those who say\"if it is your will to break Nigeria God break it now\" and those who like Apostle Suleman pronounce that the Kaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai will die and that Church members should kill any Fulani herdsman they see \n\n\"I told my people that any Fulani herdsman you see around you kill him\" Apostle Suleman commanded from the comfort of his pulpit recently\"I have told them in the Church here around this premises that any Fulani herdsman that just enters by mistake and wants to pretend kill himkill him Cut his head \n\n\"If they are busy killing Christians and nothing is happening we will kill them and nothing will happen\"\n\nALSO READ DSS invites clergyman over inciting comments\n\nAnd then he mimics someone else 'Enh Pastor why are you saying they should kill somebody' Suleman's answer came from Suleman \"Didn't David kill Goliath Was that spiritual Many people in Kaduna are now homeless are now orphans are now fatherlessbecause some people think they own power KILL THEM\n\n\"Are we Christians Yes Are we believers Yes You can't be widows you can't be widowers because of some devilish people that say they have a religion\" play Jesus Christ must have been turning in heaven His message of love and not returning an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth was being trod on in Kaduna North of Nigeria \n\nFor his reward Suleman was guest of Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State the week after clips of his hate sermon went viral \n\nIt had to be Fayose\n\nFayose would spend some 10 odd minutes eulogising the Pastor for always speaking truth to power before a crowd of crusade attendees \n\nWhile in Ekiti DSS Department of State Security operatives made to quiz Suleman but he rang the Governor who immediately came to his rescue When he's not flaunting his well tailored suit on the altar he can be a scared man who has State Governors on speed dial \n\nApostle Suleman has promised that Nigeria will burn if he spends a day in the custody of security operatives He's been invited to appear at the DSS office in Abuja on Monday January 30 2017 \n\nLatest news reports say Suleman has planned to storm the DSS office with as many as 30 lawyers play \"Suleman will be appearing before the DSS with about 30 lawyers because we believe that his persecution has become politicised\" one source told Punch newspaper\n\nWho would have thought that Apostle Suleman will ever call on the services of lawyers What does a man who can burn Nigeria down with just his tongue need 30 lawyers for \n\nWhy would a man who charges his followers to call on God when they are in trouble call on Governor Fayose to help him when he landed in trouble\n\nNo one loves what is happening in Kaduna There's been a breakdown of law and order in the South of that State for more than 30 years now and it's time the genocide is brought to a halt ALSO READ We can't pretend like majority of the persons being killed in Southern Kaduna aren't Christians We can't pretend like majority of the homes being set ablaze do not belong to persons who aren't Muslims or who aren't from the North of Nigeria But you don't solve a crisis of that proportion by inciting hate from the pulpit You don't solve a crisis that has dragged on for this long by taking the laws into your hands and asking the flock to go rogue play The last thing a nation sitting on dangerous fault-lines like in Nigeria's case needs are sermons that ask one religion to pick up arms against the other or slay every herdsman even those who are going about their business as peacefully and legitimately as possible \n\nChristianity has never been a movement of violence even though across the world there's that temptation from the Christian community to pick up arms and go on the rampage \n\nThe Church is built on a bastion of love tolerance and sobriety \n\nHate preaching has burnt down whole countries led to loss of lives and limbs led to the holocaust and anti-semitism and led to the election of a demagogue and lunatic into the White House\n\nImagine what will become of Nigeria if every Pastor orders all Christians to cut off the heads of herdsmen across the country play Apostle Suleman and his band of hate-preaching fire-belching clergymen--whether they are Imams Alfas or Pastors--do not belong in our country They do not belong in our world\n\nAnd we should be brave enough to remind them so whenever they go down this dangerous path \n\nSuleman should be charged by the State and prosecuted in accordance with the laws of the land if only to serve as some deterrence Hate preachers aren't wanted in Nigeria","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Apostle Johnson Suleman:

Gen. Xavier Becerra in his new job, it was an unheralded duty that Republican legislators wanted to pin him down on during recent confirmation hearings in Sacramento: the vetting of ballot initiatives.\n\nThe attorney general is tasked under California law to write a brief title and summary of each measure that will end up on the state ballot.\n\n\u201cWhat will you do to ensure that you\u2019re being descriptive and objective, and following the election code, when you write those ballot titles and summaries?\u201d asked Assemblyman Jordan Cunningham (R-Templeton).\n\nTo understand the question requires knowing a bit of California political history. Attorneys general have long had the duty to collect and then prepare proposed initiatives before the measure\u2019s backers can begin collecting voter signatures.\n\nBut in the era of big money initiative campaigns \u2014 generally viewed as the years following the landmark 1978 property tax rollback, Proposition 13 \u2014 critics have occasionally complained of partisan scheming, alleging that the title and summary of an initiative are sometimes crafted in a way that pleases the attorney general\u2019s political allies. Opponents of Proposition 13 complained that former Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger, a Republican, wrote a summary that didn\u2019t reveal the law made it harder to pass tax increases in the Legislature. Gov. Jerry Brown, in his time as attorney general, took fire over the ballot summary for the 2008 ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8, and its emphasis on how the (now defunct) law would \u201celiminate\u201d the right of same-sex couples to marry.\n\nAdvocates of overhauling California\u2019s public employee pension system have balked more than once over initiative titles and summaries written by Democrats serving as attorney general. In 2005, a proposed reform was summarized as removing death and disability benefits. The most recent attorney general, now Sen. Kamala Harris, also came under fire for her summaries of efforts to change pension benefits for government workers.\n\nThe evidence is largely circumstantial. And judges have generally given pretty wide latitude to the attorney general, who\u2019s simply instructed in state election law to summarize \u201cthe chief purpose and points\u201d of an initiative.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a potential game changer. Strategists and pollsters often believe an initiative\u2019s title and summary is a prescient predictor of the campaign ahead. And some California voters make snap decisions on ballot measures based on those easily accessible nuggets of information.\n\nGiven that Democrats have held the office of attorney general for 18 years, it\u2019s hardly surprising that the loudest calls for change come from Republicans.

He declared: \u201cthis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period.\u201d\n\nThis was Spicer\u2019s first official press briefing and his lecturing tone to the attending press was rightly received both in a critical and ridiculing manner, particularly given his inaccurate claims on crowd size which were easily disproved through available aerial photographic evidence circulating on social media.\n\nTrump already circulating \u2018misinformation\u2019\n\nIt is alarming however, that despite such clear evidence confirming the disparity in numbers between former President Obama\u2019s first inauguration in 2009 and Trump\u2019s in 2017, Spicer (and more so the new regime) persisted in knowingly relaying incorrect information to the world\u2019s press, in an unashamedly and blatant attempt to reconstruct the truth.\n\nIn other words, circulating \u201cmisinformation\u201d. To compound such falsehoods, Trump\u2019s senior advisor Kellyanne Conway attempted to defend and spin such nonsensical statements by claiming Spicer \u201cgave alternative facts\u201d.\n\nOf late, the term \u201cmisinformation\u201d has become commonplace within the political arena, and is in itself a sad indictment of the way politics has developed and transitioned in recent years.\n\nBrexit propaganda\n\nThe Brexit propaganda machine utilised for the \u201cLeave\u201d side during last year\u2019s EU referendum campaign, which saw the UK electorate voting to leave the EU, aptly demonstrated the powerful effect misinformation can achieve if orchestrated to the right target audience.\n\nConservative MP Michael Gove, a talisman for the Vote \u201cLeave\u201d side had said during a Sky News interview before the vote that, \u201cBritain has had enough of experts.\u201d Such rhetoric was clearly unsubstantiated but utilised to fuel doubts about the role of experts and their societal importance.\n\nFormer UKIP Leader Nigel Farage admitted the day after the shock result, that it was a \u201cmistake\u201d to promise that £350 million a week would be spent on the NHS if the UK backed a Brexit vote, after this monumental funding pledge had been used as a key influencing tactic throughout the campaign.\n\nThe deliberate propagation of ignorance\n\nKellyanne Conway gets ready to go on television outside the White House, January 22 2017. \n\nTony Blair apologised publically last year following the damning report from the Chilcot inquiry, which heavily criticised Blair for his decision to lead Britain to war in Iraq in 2003. The report noted that Blair had exaggerated the case for war in Iraq and that Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies produced \u201cflawed information\u201d.\n\nThe above examples, to name but a few, demonstrate that the use of covert misinformation is not a new phenomenon and has been the subject of much research in previous decades. One prominent expert on this topic is Robert Proctor, a science historian at Standford University, who coined the word \u201cagnotology\u201d to describe the study of \u201cdeliberate propagation of ignorance\u201d.\n\nProctor\u2019s initial research into the so-called study of \u201cagnotology\u201d arose from the communicative tactics Big Tobacco companies deployed in the 1970s, to allegedly create doubt in the minds of the public about the harmful effects of smoking. Such confusion and deceit was aimed at obscuring the facts for the benefit of the ever lucrative tobacco industry.\n\nIn a more modern context, occasional dissenting and unverified data reports that question the validity of legitimate facts relating to climate change and the imminent need for protective measures, could be linked with such deliberate dissemination of mass ignorance for unscrupulous corporate gain.\n\nGlobal brands use covert propaganda\n\nLarge-scale corporate self-interest enables global companies and brands to fund mass manipulative propaganda in a more covert and sophisticated manner than ever before.\n\nThrough the creation of biased think-tanks that have the potential to influence policy or through the promotion of online bloggers who gain financially for their impartial support of industry positions or products, all play an important role in shaping public opinion and swaying the political agenda.\n\nThere is little doubt that Trump is unlike most modern day politicians and he has prided himself on being a businessman first. This exception to the rule can be attractive for some of the electorate who have grown tired or apathetic towards the political elite.\n\nWhat is most unusual however, is that in the past such misinformation was carried out in a disguised and guarded fashion as to avoid unwanted detection or scrutiny by the media or various interest groups.\n\nOpenly altering the truth\n\nOn the contrary, the attempt to overtly contradict clear evidence of previous crowd data as done this week by the new Trump team, sends a powerful message that the truth may be challenged and facts altered to suit Trump\u2019s manifesto and future policies.\n\nIt can be quite innocuous where the truth is openly altered for something as irrelevant as mere crowd numbers, but can be fatal when orchestrated for acts to justify war or the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nIt is a worrying time for world politics and international affairs. There is now an even greater need for journalistic endeavour to uphold the truth and maintain ethical integrity.\n\nSimilarly, an even greater role must be placed on all citizens to ensure they take responsibility for their civic duties in questioning such misinformation and seeking the truth, where possible, to ensure that justice and liberty prevail in these turbulent times.\n\nJason O\u2019 Sullivan, is a solicitor and public affairs consultant at JOS Solicitors.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jason O'Sullivan"},"topics":[],"title":"Alternative facts: 'Trump sent a powerful message that facts can be altered to suit his own agenda'","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"IE","country":"Ireland"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"TheJournal.ie","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"175383370","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"286"},"name":"TheJournal.ie","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thejournal.ie"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://jossolicitors.ie/"],"sequenceId":"695205073377","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:34:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://img2.thejournal.ie/article/3207199/river/?height=400&version=3207276"}],"video":[]}}

My own is no exception.\" \n \nThe Queen celebrated her 90th birthday last year and had a busy schedule commemorating the occasion, with a walkabout, beacon lighting and a black tie dinner for family and friends in Windsor on her actual birthday. \n \nA weekend of national celebrations, including a party on The Mall, was held for her official birthday in June. \n   \nIt is likely that any large-scale jubilee celebrations will be reserved for the Platinum Jubilee in 2022 - although any events will take into account the fact that Queen is due to turn 96 that year. \n \nThe Duke of Cambridge is about to become a full-time royal this summer and will increase his official duties on behalf of the Queen. William and the Duchess of Cambridge are carrying out an engagement on Monday February 6, but not to do with the Queen's record-breaking reign. \n \nThey will be attending Place2Be's Big Assembly at a primary school in north London to mark Children's Mental Health Week. \n \nThe anniversary of Elizabeth II's accession to the throne in 1952 is a poignant time for the Queen, marking the day her father George VI died. \n \nShe often spends Accession Day privately at Sandringham, having staying there through the Christmas period. She usually makes her return to Buckingham Palace a few days later. \n \nRoyal gun salutes will be staged in London on February 6, as is the tradition. \n \nA 41-gun salute will be fired by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park at noon, \n \nThe Band of the Royal Artillery will play a selection of celebratory music close to the firing position, and 89 horses will pull six First World War-era 13-pounder field guns into position in the park. \n \nA 62-gun salute by the Honourable Artillery Company will be fired at the Tower of London at 1pm.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"}],"title":"Queen to reach Sapphire Jubilee","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"AOL UK","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662251","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"AOL UK","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Financials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.aol.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695205075875","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:34:14Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

PAUL \u2014 Gov. Mark Dayton is ready for the Capitol to return to its normal level of bickering, chaos and policy after telling the state he had cancer and fainting in front of a statewide audience last week. \n \n\u201cNow, it\u2019s back to business to usual,\u201d the Democratic-Farmer-Labor governor said Wednesday. \n \n\u201cBusiness as usual\u201d included defending his $46 billion two-year budget proposal, signing a long-awaited health insurance premium relief bill and hosting a water summit in Morris, Minn. But it also included a trip to Rochester\u2019s Mayo Clinic, well-wishes from former President Bill Clinton and repeated defenses that he can \u2014 and will \u2014 perform the job the state elected him to do. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m intellectually in my prime and I\u2019m physically capable of doing the job. And I\u2019ve done the job. I haven\u2019t had a vacation in almost two years,\u201d the governor said. \u201cI know I\u2019m fit for the job.\u201d \n \nThe split screen may last throughout what is expected to be a brutal legislative session, dominated by battles between Republicans and the Democratic governor on how much of the state\u2019s cash to spend. Dayton, who turned 70 on Thursday, pledges he will stay as involved in that fight as he ever was and legislators, while sympathizing with his health issues, will stand firm in return. \n \nLawmakers last week already added some humanity to their normal legislative process. \n \n\u201cI think maybe it humanized our relationships a little more,\u201d said House Speaker Kurt Daudt, a Republican from near Crown. \u201cI think it helps us see him, and have a more personal relationship.\u201d \n \nWhen Republican legislative leaders reacted to Dayton\u2019s budget plans \u2014 too rich, by far, for many in the GOP \u2014 they expressed concern about the governor before they began their critique. The Minnesota Senate on Thursday paused after passing the $325 million insurance measure to acknowledge Dayton\u2019s health concerns and sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to him. And Alexandria Rep. Mary Franson, a Republican who is generally not a fan of Dayton\u2019s policies, sent the governor flowers after his Monday collapse. \n \n\u201cMy heart just went out to the governor; what happened to him was on live television. \u2026 My model is practice kindness, and what a way to show compassion and kindness,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can disagree about policies, but that does not negate the fact that we are human beings.\u201d \n \nOTHER STATES \n \nDayton felt the need to announce his prostate cancer diagnosis Tuesday because of his dramatic tumble 40 minutes into his State of the State speech. He had fainted, he and his medical providers at the Mayo Clinic said. The collapse, which happened in a House chamber packed with lawmakers, state officials and watching Minnesotans, was \u201crelated to standing for a long time while giving his speech and possible dehydration,\u201d the clinic said. \n \nAlthough he had told close staff and advisers of the diagnosis, he had planned to release it more publicly after he consulted with his doctors on the course of treatment. \n \nThat\u2019s the route other governors have taken. \n \nLast year, both Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and Alaska Gov. Bill Walker disclosed to their states that they had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, a common ailment among older men. \n \nWhen Wolf announced it, he was \u201cunclear about the exact course of treatment he will undergo, he said it wouldn\u2019t require surgery or involve chemotherapy,\u201d according to a news report. Walker, surrounded by his family, shared the news of his cancer at the same time he said that he would have surgery to treat it. \n \nIn neither of those states did the cancer news change the political dynamics at play. Both of those governors took some time away from the public eye and then returned to work. \n \n\u201cThe mood really did not change,\u201d said Jan Murphy, capitol bureau chief for Pennlive and the Patriot-News in Pennsylvania. \u201cWe have other issues that are occupying our lawmakers\u2019 attention these days.\u201d \n \nIn Alaska, the governor was out of commission for about a week. While there was an outpouring of well-wishes, like there has been in Minnesota, the cancer news and treatment did not change the mood. \n \n\u201cThere has been no difference whatsoever in the way anyone has treated anyone,\u201d said Nathaniel Herz, a reporter for the Alaska Dispatch News. \u201cIt was almost sort of like a one-day distraction and then everyone moved on.\u201d \n \nDayton has long been dogged by speculation that he might prematurely quit his political life. The fainting spell and the cancer diagnosis, though, may have brought more attention to his health than other governors have experienced. \n \nWHAT\u2019S NEXT? \n \nDayton aggressively returned to work, despite the health issues. \n \nOn Tuesday, the day after he fainted and before he announced his cancer, he strode to a Capitol podium to promote his budget plans. Although the governor, who has had hip and back surgeries while in office, appeared slightly winded when he began speaking, he gained steam as the hourlong unveiling went on. \n \nHe also kept up a schedule of public appearances \u2014 including a Wednesday morning speech to an educators conference and a Wednesday evening reception with lawmakers \u2014 throughout the week before capping it off with travel to Morris, nearly three hours outside of the Twin Cities, to talk about water. He also was to appear on live television shows on Friday and Sunday. \n \nIn the coming weeks, Dayton has said, other than a trip to the Mayo Clinic to talk cancer treatment, it will be more of the same. He has dozens of meetings scheduled with state officials and others for the first week of February as well as speaking engagements. \n \nDespite his appreciation of the expressions of concern from legislators across the aisle, Dayton said he does not think his ailments will have a lasting effect on the tone of the negotiations. \n \n\u201cI\u2019d like to believe they would all just agree to my budget now. It\u2019s just common courtesy,\u201d he joked. \u201cNo, it\u2019ll go down the same.\u201d \n \n\u201cI have my mandate, and they got elected recently and they have their mandate,\u201d he said of Republicans who control the Legislature. \u201cThey\u2019re very different perspectives on what\u2019s best for Minnesota. We have very genuine, very deep-seated and very sincere differences. But I\u2019m not going to back down on what I believe is best for Minnesota, and I expect them to do the same.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"}],"title":"With health in the spotlight, Dayton seeks return to normalcy","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Montgomery","zipCode":"19034","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fort Washington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Montgomery Life","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"355125383","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Montgomery Life","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://montgomerynews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695205077361","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:34:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

On Thursday\u2019s Morning Drive on the Golf Channel, live at the Orange County Convention Center, the STAR EV Sirius took center stage along with big industry names like Club Car, E-Z-Go, and Garia. \n \nAlthough primarily associated with golf, the golf car industry now encompasses a wide range of small vehicles from LSVs (a street legal low-speed vehicle) to utility vehicles to the classic golf course companion. STAR EV kept the golf course-to-neighborhood overlap in mind with the ground-up creation of the new Sirius model, which boasts automotive conveniences like an electronic locking trunk, USB port, LED illuminated dashboard, and self-cancelling turn signals. But it is still golf course worthy, with optional golf ball holder inserts, and a large bagwell, or the option of a 2-in-1 Combo Seat (a patented design that turns a rear seat into a golf bag holder without tools). \n \nSTAR EV revealed two prototypes at its PGA show exhibit; a standard Sirius with 2-in-1 Combo Seat, and a \u201ctricked-out\u201d version to show how customizable the Sirius will be. The front trunk gives the golf car the look of a hood that can be painted a different color from the main body, like the sleek matte black trunk on the deep metallic maroon prototype. STAR EV also offers a variety of wheels, with rim finishes in machined aluminum, matte black, dura chrome, black PVD, and special color accents. \n \nWhile the models at the show were standard 2 and 4-passenger vehicles, the Sirius line will expand to include 6 and 8 passenger models like the STAR EV Classic. As all STAR\u2019s vehicles, the Sirius is 100% electric with a 4 kW AC motor, 350 A Curtis AC controller, and can travel at a top speed of 19.5 mph. (The LSV version peaks at 25 mph.) The line officially launches in the summer of 2017, available through any of STAR\u2019s 250+ authorized dealers nationwide and internationally. \n  \nShare article on social media or email","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Radio industry news","group":"Media"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: golf news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"New Sirius model from STAR Electric Vehicles makes its debut at PGA...","source":{"category":"Press Wire","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"PRWeb","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661338","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5536"},"name":"PRWeb","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Miscellaneous"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.prweb.com","publisher":"PR Newswire"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyZXYuY29t","http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyZXYuY29tL2RlYWxlci1sb2NhdG9yLw=="],"sequenceId":"695205080013","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:34:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Goals from Arjen Robben and David Alaba helped the Bundesliga leaders to secure the 14th win of the season, reports Xinhua news agency. \n \nThe \"Green-Whites\" started on a highly motivated note and kept the uninspired Bavarians busy. Yet, the hosts lacked in accuracy and wasted opportunities.  \n \nBayern increased their pressure at the half-hour mark and broke the deadlock out of the blue when Franck Ribery rushed down the left wing to pass into the box to find Robben, who poked home the opener with a one-timer into the bottom right with 31 minutes played. \n \nCarlo Ancelotti's men doubled the lead just before the break as David Alaba curled the ball over the wall into the top right corner following a free kick from 20 meters. \n \nAfter the restart, Bremen were able to reduce the arrears after Max Kruse overcame Manuel Neuer from close range in the 53rd minute. The hosts gained momentum but Bayern were able to protect their 2-1 lead to the end. \n \nWith the result, Bayern stay atop the standings with a three-point advantage whereas 15th-placed Bremen remain at the edge of the relegation zone. \n \nIn the other match, Leipzig wrapped up an important 2-1 comeback win over third-placed Hoffenheim, whose unbeaten streak ended.  \n \nTimo Werner and Marcel Sabitzer were on target to keep the \"Red Bulls\" on Bayern's heels. \n \nDespite being under pressure in the opening period, the visitors from Hoffenheim opened the scoring with 19 minutes into the game.  \n \nSebastian Rudy forced a turn over following a Leipzig corner, allowing Nadiem Amiri to complete a five-pass counter attack. \n \nLeipzig remained unimpressed and responded in the 38th minute as Timo Werner slotted home Naby Keita's build-up play to restore parity before the half time. \n \nAfter the restart, things went from bad to worse for the visitors as Sandro Wagner received his marching orders following a rude foul play on Stefan Ilsanker in the 60th minute. \n \nThe hosts capitalised on their numerical advantage and snatched the 2-1 winner through Marcel Sabitzer, who unleashed a 22-meter effort to beat Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann in the 77th minute. \n \nWith the 13th victory of the season, Leipzig remain second while Hoffenheim slipped from the third to fourth spot. \n \nElsewhere, Cologne crushed last-placed Darmstadt 6-1 thanks to Yuya Osako's brace. \n \nWolfsburg lost 2-1 to Augsburg while Ingolstadt shocked Hamburg 3-1 and Monchengladbach turned the tides from two goals down to beat Leverkusen 3-2. \n \n© 2017 IANS India Private Limited.

The weeks-long conflict had become one of the biggest internal challenges yet to Francis' efforts to modernize the 1.2 billion member Roman Catholic Church. \n \nAt issue was the Order's reaction to the discovery that condoms had been distributed by one of its aid projects in Myanmar. The Order had fired its Grand Chancellor, Albrecht Freiherr von Boeselager, whom it held responsible for the condom distribution. Von Boeselager declined to comment for this article. \n \nThough condom use goes against Catholic teaching, the Vatican had ordered an investigation into the firing of von Boeselager. It subsequently publicly castigated Festing, who had refused to cooperate with the investigation. \n \nBacking down, Festing, a former Sotheby's art auctioneer, gave a hand-written resignation letter to Francis in the pope's private residence, according to a senior Vatican source. Festing, who has the title of prince, declined an interview request. \n \nInstead of quelling the conflict, however, Festing's resignation was followed by yet another challenge to Francis' authority - led by vocal pope critic American Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, according to Vatican and Knights sources. \n \nIn particular: Burke tried to convince Festing to withdraw his resignation and keep fighting the pope, these sources say. On Saturday, the Knight's Sovereign Council accepted Festing's resignation and re-instated von Boselager, a clear defeat for Burke. \n \nBurke declined to comment for this article. \n \nThe tussle suggested Francis is still battling to consolidate his power over the Church almost four years into his tenure, Vatican insiders say. \n \nBeyond a fight over condoms, the clash pointed to lingering divisions between the Church's conservatives and more progressive factions who support the pope's reformist agenda, they add. \n \nFrancis is trying to make the Church less dogmatic and more welcoming to whose who have felt excluded, such as homosexuals and the divorced. \n \n\"While this whole saga was an internal matter that probably should have stayed that way, it metamorphosed into a clash that showed the divide between conservatives and progressives,\" said Andrea Tornielli, author of several books on Pope Francis. \n \nThe Vatican declined to comment on the clash and on Pope Francis' efforts to consolidate his power. \n \nIt directed Reuters to two public statements. One, on Dec. 22, relates to the Vatican order to investigate the firing of von Boeselager. The second, on Jan. 17, followed a pledge by Festing on the Knights' web page not to cooperate with the Vatican. It decried his resistance and ordered members of the order to cooperate. \n \n    GERMAN ARISTOCRAT \n \nThe all-male top leaders of the Knights of Malta are not clerics, but they take vows of poverty, chastity and obedience to the pope. \n \nA German aristocrat whose father participated in a failed plot to kill Hitler in World War Two, von Boeselager was fired by Festing in December, and accused of having allowed the use of condoms while he was head of the Knights' global humanitarian projects. \n \nFesting fired him in Burke's presence, arguing that the German had hidden the condom use from the order's leaders when he was named Grand Chancellor, according to Knights and Vatican sources. \n \nImmediately, the firing set off the conflict between the Knights' hierarchy and the Vatican. \n \nVon Boeselager , a devout Catholic, said in a statement on Dec. 23 that he was fully behind Church teachings. He closed two projects in the developing world when he discovered condoms were being distributed but kept a third running in Myanmar for a while because closing it would have abruptly ended all basic medical services to poor people. \n \nThe Church does not allow condoms as a means of birth control and says abstinence and monogamy in heterosexual marriage is the best way to stop the spread of AIDS. \n \n    In the same statement, von Boeselager said Festing and Burke told him the Vatican wanted him to resign and that there would be \"severe consequences\" for the Order if he did not. \n \nThe Vatican denied, in a letter from its secretary of state to the Order and seen by Reuters, that it had mandated the resignation, saying it had told the Knights the pope wanted a solution through dialogue. \n \nThe German said his sacking was against the Knights' constitution and appealed to the pope, who ordered the investigation. \n \nFesting refused to cooperate, issuing a series of increasingly strident public statements. In one, he called the papal commission that was investigating the firing \"legally irrelevant\". \n \nIn a Jan. 14 confidential letter to the top echelons of the order and seen by Reuters, Festing wrote: \"In refusing to acknowledge this group of people's jurisdiction, I am trying to protect the order's sovereignty\". \n \nThe institution has the status of a sovereign entity, maintaining diplomatic relations with over 100 states and the European Union and permanent observer status at the United Nations. \n \nThe pope was irritated by Festing's defiant stand, a senior Vatican source said, and the Vatican shot back with a public statement ordering the Knights to obey. \n \nAfter that public order, Festing changed his tune and resigned in the pope's residence a week later. \n \nFesting's resignation came as a shock for many inside the Knights: some of them told Reuters it was akin to the resignation of Pope Benedict in 2013. \n \nFour sources said that for many others in the order, it came as a relief. They feared the clash was damaging the image of the institution whose 13,000 members, 80,000 volunteers and 20,000 paid medical staff help the neediest around the world. \n \nThe day after Festing handed his resignation to the pope, Cardinal Burke drove to the order's headquarters from his apartment near the Vatican and sought to persuade Festing to withdraw his resignation, a source from the Vatican and one from the Knights said. \n \nBurke declined to comment on his meeting with Festing. \n \nBurke has long been leading challenges against the pope. Pope Francis demoted him from a top Vatican job in 2014 with no official explanation and assigned him to be the \"patron\" of the Order of Malta. \n \nSuch \"patron\" positions are usually given to older cardinals after they retire at 75. Burke was only 66 then and the demotion was widely seen as a sign of the pope's irritation with the cardinal's constant sniping over Francis\u2019 reforms. \n \nIn particular, Burke has contested moves by the pope that would allow Catholics who have divorced and re-married outside the Church without an annulment to return to the sacrament of communion. Burke declined to comment on his demotion. \n \nSince the demotion, Burke has become even more of a rallying point for conservatives, flying around the world to give lectures to conservative groups and often giving interviews criticising the pope's decisions. \n \nIn November, he led a rare public challenge to the pope with three other cardinals who accused the pontiff of sowing confusion on important moral issues such as that of communion for the divorced. \n \nBurke later said in an interview that if the pope did not respond to their letter, the cardinals might need to \"correct\" the pope themselves for the good of the Church. \n \nThe Vatican did not comment on the uprising at the time but many of the pope's supporters publicly criticised the four cardinals. \n \nThe pope will now appoint a \"pontifical delegate\" to help run the order, at least until elections can be held for a new Grand Master. \n \nIn a personal letter to the Sovereign Council on Jan. 27 and seen by Reuters, Francis made clear that the Vatican did not want to interfere with the Order's sovereignty but said his delegate would seek to \"renew the spirituality of the Order, specifically of those members who take vows.\" \n \n(Editing by Mark Bendeich, Philippa Fletcher and Alessandra Galloni)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Malta news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Italy news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Knights of Malta-Vatican feud - a tale of chivalry and sovereignty","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"SG","country":"Singapore"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Channel NewsAsia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169662733","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"142"},"name":"Channel NewsAsia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.channelnewsasia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695205085025","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:25:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:34:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The report found that some universities, such as CSUDH, with a much larger percentage of students from low-income families, have very high mobility rates, and high earnings outcomes that are closely comparable to students at highly selective colleges. \n \nThe Equity of Opportunity Project\u2019s findings were derived from 30 million college students. The data was compiled from statistics on students\u2019 earnings and their parents\u2019 incomes for each college in the United States. \n \nAbout CSU Dominguez Hills -- With a student population of nearly 15,000, many who are first in their families to attend college, CSU Dominguez Hills provides high quality academic programs to students who aspire to succeed and thrive in a complex, global society.

The American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued for a temporary stay that allowed detained travelers to stay in the United States. \n \nSupporters outside the Brooklyn courtroom and at protests at airports in Dallas, Chicago, New York and elsewhere cheered the decision, but a bigger fight lay ahead. \n \nThe court action does not reverse Trump's order, which was criticized by some of America's closest allies. \n \nTrump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. \n \nHe told reporters in the White House's Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \"not a Muslim ban\" and said the measures were long overdue. \n \n\"It's working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over,\" Trump said. \n \nAlong with Syria, the ban affects travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \n \n\n\n \nThe Department of Homeland Security said about 375 travelers had been affected by the order, 109 of whom were in transit and were denied entry to the United States. Another 173 were stopped by airlines before boarding. \n \nThe order \"affects a minor portion of international travelers,\" the department said in a statement, saying the measures \"inconvenienced\" less than 1 percent of travelers. \n \nThe new rules blindsided people in transit and families waiting for them, and caused havoc for businesses with employees holding passports from the targeted nations and colleges with international students. \n \nPegah Rahmani, 25, waited at Washington's Dulles airport for several hours for her grandparents, both Iranian citizens with U.S. green cards. \"They weren't treating them very well,\" she said. \n \nRahmani's grandfather is 88 and legally blind. Her grandmother is 83 and recently had a stroke. They were released to loud cheers and cries. \n \nSeveral Democratic governors said they were examining whether they could launch legal challenges, and other groups eyed a constitutional challenge claiming religious discrimination. \n \n\"I don't think anyone is going to take this lying down,\" said Cleveland immigration lawyer David Leopold. \"This is the tip of the spear and more litigation is coming.\" \n \nThe White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment. \n \nThe Department of Homeland Security said the order would stay in place. \n \n\"No foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States,\" the department statement said. \n \nMark Krikorian, the director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, called lawsuits challenging the order \"last ditch efforts\" that would only apply to a few individuals, and he said a broader constitutional argument would be hard to win. \n \n\"The first amendment doesn't apply to foreigners living abroad. The law explicitly says the president can exclude any person or class of people he wants,\" Krikorian said. \n \nSome leaders from the U.S. technology industry, a major employer of foreign workers, issued warnings to their staff and called the order immoral and un-American. \n \n\"This ban will impact many innocent people,\" said Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc, who said he would raise the issue at a White House meeting on Friday. \n \nArab travelers in the Middle East and North Africa said the order was humiliating and discriminatory. Iran vowed to retaliate. \n \nSudan called the action \"very unfortunate\" after Washington lifted sanctions on the country just weeks ago for cooperation on combating terrorism. A Yemeni official expressed dismay at the ban. \n \nIraq's former ambassador to the United States, Lukman Faily, told Reuters that Trump's ban was unfair to a country that itself has been a victim of terror attacks, and could backfire. \n \n\"We have a strong partnership with U.S., more so in the urgent fight against terrorism. This ban move will not help, and people will start questioning the bond of this partnership, Faily said. \n \nAllies in the United Kingdom, France and Germany were critical. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted a photo of himself welcoming Syrian refugees. \n \nConfusion abounded at airports as immigration and customs officials struggled to interpret the new rules. Some legal residents with green cards who were in the air when the order was issued were detained at airports upon arrival. \n \nHowever, senior administration officials said it would have been \"reckless\" to broadcast details of the order in advance. Other officials said green card holders from the affected countries would require extra screening and would be cleared on a case-by-case basis. < \n \n\n\np>Airlines were blindsided and some cabin crew were barred from entering the country. \nTravelers were handled differently at different points of entry and immigration lawyers advised clients to change their destination to the more lenient airports, said Houston immigration lawyer Mana Yegani. \n \nAt Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport, brothers Bardia and Ayden Noohi waited for four hours for their father Kasra Noohi - who has an Iranian passport and a U.S. green card - to be allowed through. \n \nThey knew Trump had pledged tougher rules but did not expect the problems. \"I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d actually do it,\" Bardia Noohi, 32, said. \"A lot of politicians just talk.\" \n \nThousands of refugees seeking entry were thrown into limbo. Melanie Nezer of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society said she knew of roughly 2,000 who were booked to come to the United States next week. \n \nTrump's order indefinitely bans refugees from Syria. In a television interview, he said he would seek to prioritize Christian refugees fleeing the war-torn country. \n \nU.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were not consulted on the action and in some cases only learned the details as they were made public. \n \nAt the State Department, a senior official said lawyers were working to interpret the executive order, which allows entry to people affected by the order when it is in the \"national interest.\" \n \nHowever, a federal law enforcement official said: \"It's unclear at this point what the threshold of national interest is.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Chaos, anger as Trump ban halts Muslim immigrants","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Sify","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657349","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"Sify","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sify.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695205090903","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:34:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Photo: Bureau of Meteorology \n  \nIf this January has seemed hotter and drier than usual, that's because it has been - especially at night. \n \nMaximum daytime temperatures in Sydney last January averaged 27.4 degrees. This January has so far averaged 29.1 degrees, which should rise with two more hot days to end the month. \n \nMeanwhile, Sydney has smashed the previous record for hot nights in January, with four nights (so far) staying above 24 degrees. The previous record was two. \n \nSydney is on track to break the record for the number of summer days above 35 degrees, with just two more needed to break the all-time record \n \nMr Taggart said this January has been \"almost certainly one of the hottest on record\". \n \nAnd the heat won't end this week. Next weekend is forecast to again hit 40 degrees, Mr Taggart said, as the Bureau forecasts a \"hotter than average\" February with hot conditions pushing into March. \n \nJanuary is also likely to end with less than half the month's average rainfall. So far the city has had 48.8mm, much lower than the average of 102.5mm. \n \nIt's also significantly less than last year when Sydney received 249.8mm during January. \n \nElsewhere in the state, Moree is in the middle of a remarkable hot streak, with the town sweltering through 34 consecutive days above 35 degrees. Mr Taggart expects that to stretch to 41 days based on current forecasts, close to the state record. \n \n\"The forecast for the next seven days is pretty horrific,\" Mr Taggart said. \"That heat is completely unrelenting.\" \n \n\"The forecast seems bad for Richmond and Sydney, but it's nothing compared to Moree.\" \n \nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Josh Dye"},"topics":[{"name":"Weather news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"}],"title":"NSW weather: Heatwave, severe fire danger as students return to school","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"4812","state":"Queensland","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Hyde Park","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"North Queensland Register","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"170597955","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"North Queensland Register","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.northqueenslandregister.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695205091073","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:05:24Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:34:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/b1388d02-e7af-480c-8629-bb881cc357f5.jpg/r0_0_727_410_w600_h338_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

We will look for votes everywhere, and we will protect our votes in Nyanza from the voting time to the announcement of the results, even if they are two votes. Tell the leaders from Luo Nyanza who incite people not to accept Jubilee in the area that they need to grow up,\" said Tuju.\n\nHe went on: \"But remember that anybody who thinks they will block Jubilee from getting into their perceived strongholds should also not expect to be welcomed in Jubilee strongholds.\"\n\nTuju dismissed claims by Oloo, which were exclusively reported in The Standard on Sunday last week that with his exit, Jubilee was dead and buried in Nyanza.\n\nOloo had said he had crossed to ODM with baskets of secrets from Jubilee, which he will pass over to ODM leader Raila Odinga. In the expose, Oloo claimed Raila was robbed of victory in 2013.\n\nTuju revisited his foul relationship with the Opposition leader Raila, indicating that his differences with the former premier were more ideological than personal. ALSO \"I will not get back to the elective politics for as long as Luos still believe that the only way to elective leadership is through following Raila,\" he said.\n\nTuju revisited a 2002 General Election incident where he claimed Raila\u2019s elder brother, Oburu Odinga, had vowed not to have him get the party nomination certificate even after he won.\n\n\"Oburu wanted the certificate given to my opponent, Moses Owiti Malo Malo, but it got to a point that he could not substantiate how the opponent had beaten me in the nominations. That is how I ended up with the party ticket and got to Parliament,\" he said. But Oburu rubbished his claims.\n\n\"Tuju rigged the nominations and got the certificate through backdoor. He bribed people at the headquarters and made his way through. We however supported him and pleaded with Malo Malo not to move to another party,\" said Oburu.\n\nOburu laughed off Tuju\u2019s role in President Kenyatta\u2019s re-election saying Tuju cannot even manage his own campaign.\n\n\"He (Tuju) dropped his political ambitions because he cannot manage to get votes himself.

But it is still quite flat because of the split elevation.\u201d \n \nThe frameless glass door entry opens to reveal polished concrete floors, 4.5m ceilings and enormous glass windows that capture ocean and forest views. \n \n\u201cConcrete and timber doesn\u2019t age,\u201d Mr MacDonald said. \n \n\u201cTrends in homes change all the time so we stuck to a style that wouldn\u2019t go out of fashion. \n \nBuilding materials connect with the bush landscape. \n  \n\u201cThere are rust-style features which are actually just painted plastic to look authentic. \n \n\u201cIt took me three months to paint the rusted iron style feature around the stairs but it is more sustainable and durable that way. We wanted something that would last, especially since we have four children.\u201d \n \nMr MacDonald said the property overlooked a nice sunset but he described the morning sunrise as magic. \n \n\u201cIt is a cracker of a sky,\u201d he said. \n \nThe home is listed for offers over $2.35 million, through Nicole Carter and Russel Segal at RE/MAX Regency, Gold Coast","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Hannah Sbeghen"},"topics":[{"name":"Real estate news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Architecture and design news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Owner designs dream family home from treetop vision","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Realestate.com.au","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"279204395","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Realestate.com.au","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","RealEstate"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://realestate.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695205094029","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:25:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T08:34:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}
