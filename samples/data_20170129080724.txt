His haul of 549 runs at 109.8 in three matches is the second most by an Australian in India, behind only Kim Hughes, who hit 594 runs from a six-Test series in 1979/80. \n \nWhile Australia failed to end their drought in 2001, Hayden's success on that campaign instilled great confidence in his teammates for the successful 2004 mission. \n \n\"I got his number off Andy Bichel, so I might give him a call to get a few quick pointers before I head off,\" Renshaw said. \"I'm not as experienced in the sweep shot as him. [\"I'll have] a fair bit more practice over the next couple of months. \n \nDespite honing his craft on the bouncy Gabba wicket, Renshaw says he is confident against spin, although there are no players in Australia in the class of Indian duo Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. \n \n\"I'm not too bad against spin in Australia but I've never experienced spin in India, so it's hard to say [how I will go],\" Renshaw said. \n \nUnder the watch of Queensland coach Phil Jaques, Renshaw has been preparing on a pitch that is offering more spin and bounce than what he will get in India and, in his own words, \"didn't go too badly\". \n \n\"If it's harder there, it can go into a game and it gets a bit easier,\" Renshaw said. \"There's a wicket at the NCC in the indoor nets that turns a lot more, it's a bit less realistic than the Mumbai wickets at AB [Allan Border] Field. It's not the worst thing to practice on.\" \n \nRenshaw's lack of experience on the subcontinent can be seen as a negative, though the glass half full view is it means he does not bear the scars of previous failures. \n \n\"I think it helps that I've not been there. It's a challenge. I like to get up for challenges and to love the contest,\" he said. \n \nRenshaw said he would not be concerned if asked to field in close again despite suffering concussion after being hit on the helmet at short leg during the Sydney Test. \n \nThe injury resulted in him becoming the first player to be withdrawn from a Test under Cricket Australia's stringent concussion rules. \n \n\"If I have to do it in India I wouldn't be too mentally scarred from it. I'd be trying to get a couple of catches in there and win a series,\" Renshaw said. \"They [the doctors] just said I need to stop headbutting the ball.\" \n \nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Andrew Wu"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"India v Australia Test series: Matt Renshaw to consult Matthew Hayden for tips to play spin in India","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Redland City Bulletin","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"579086247","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Redland City Bulletin","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","Cricket"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.redlandcitybulletin.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195586811","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:40:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Their goaltender has allowed 17 goals in the last three games. Their once-effective penalty kill has given up eight goals in the last two games. They're seven points behind second-place Castlegar and just one point ahead of Grand Forks. \n \nAnd there's just six games left in the regular season to course correct. But despite all the numbers against them, the Leafs still went down swinging Saturday in a 5-3 loss to the Fernie Ghostriders. \n \n\"We showed some resiliency and never took a shift off,\" said defenceman Jacob Karran, who scored his first goal of the season. \"I thought we haven't played that well in a while.\" \n \nKeagan Kingwell had a hat trick while Tayler Sincennes and Alex Cheveldave also scored for the Ghostriders (23-14-3) who won their third straight game. Brandon Youngson made 30 saves in Fernie's net. \n \nMason Mullaney and Jack Karran also replied for the Leafs (18-18-5). Devin Allen allowed four goals on 25 shots before being replaced by Jared Martin, who stopped eight shots. \n \nThe Leafs were missing so many players that defenceman Dash Thompson was moved up to forward for the game. Nelson is currently without top scorers Dale Howell and Sawyer Hunt as well as defenceman Brent Headon, who were each suspended for their roles in a fight last Saturday against Castlegar. \n \nThe league also retroactively suspended Alex Meeker three games for accumulated checking to the head minors. Nelson lost an appeal to the league to have the suspensions overruled, and Leafs coach Mario DiBella said the team intends to take their appeal to BC Hockey. \n \nDespite that, the Leafs who did play compensated for the short bench with tenacious play. \n \n\"Even though we were short on bodies the players who played certainly stuck to the gameplan and executed what we expect from them,\" said DiBella. \"The results were there on the scoreboard with the amount of puck possession we had.\" \n \nThe absence of Nelson's injured top netminder Billy Gorn, whose status is uncertain for the remainder of the season, lingered throughout the game. \n \nAllen was yanked after another rough outing, paving the way for Nelson native Jared Martin. The rookie looked solid in his first appearance for Nelson. He stopped one breakaway, made another save with his helmet and later denied two quick shots to keep the Leafs in the game. \n \nMartin, who previously tried out for the Leafs in training camp and has been playing defence in midget house, earned praise for his abbreviated appearance from DiBella. \n \n\"I thought Jared was outstanding,\" said DiBella. \"I thought he was athletic, he tracked the puck real well, he played big, he followed the puck across the crease and he gave us an opportunity to win in the third period.\" \n \nThe opening period was notable for a pair of big hits. Fernie forward Nolan Legace was dumped upside down into the Leafs bench, while later on Nelson's Sam Weber was laid out on the boards and went hard to the ice. \n \nFernie went on the power play and it paid off moments after the puck was dropped. Kingwell whipped a point shot that beat Allen at 6:17 to put the visitors up 1-0. \n \nNelson left it late to find the equalizer. Nicholas Wihak did the work, carrying the puck into the zone and shooting a wrister that rebounded off Youngson's pads straight to Mullaney, who had the easy shot to score at 1:29. \n \nThat ended up being Wihak's highlight of an abbreviated night. Not long after he was charged with a check from behind and tossed from the game. \n \nBoth teams shared a pair of quick goals to start the second period. \n \nJacob Karran's point shot surprised Youngson at 18:52. But the Leafs' lead lasted exactly 12 seconds after Sincennes beat Allen before Karran's goal had been announced. \n \nFrom there it was all Fernie. Kingwell found the back of the net with a power-play point shot at 11:22, then Cheveldave had a point shot of his own go in on the man advantage five minutes later for a 4-2 lead. \n \nThat goal ended Allen's night, who was yanked for backup Martin. \n \nIt was the Leafs once again who struck first in the third. Jack Karran, who was promoted to the top line, hustled to catch up to a bouncing puck on a breakaway. Karran managed to collect the puck just in time to skate in front of Youngson and squeak a shot past the netminder. \n \n\"Once I touched it I almost lost it there, but I think that's maybe what threw the goalie off a bit,\" he said. \n \nDiBella said after the game he thinks Jack Karran is the Leafs' most improved player this season. The rookie forward has eight goals and eight assists in 34 games so far. \n \nHe was just one short Saturday. Kingwell scored an empty-net goal with 39 seconds left to punctuate another disappointing night for Nelson. \n \n\"Everyone worked hard. We're short a couple guys but it's no excuse,\" said Jack Karran. \"We were hoping for a better outcome I guess but that's the way it happens sometimes.\" \n \nLeaflets: Kidsport honoured its volunteers at the game. The organization, which provides financial assistance to children who want to play sports, is celebrating its 10th anniversary. The Nelson chapter was also awarded a $3,000 cheque by the B.C. Legacy Fund, as well as a $1,200 gift from the Nelson Lions Club. ... D Michael LeNoury returned to the Leafs after a brief Junior A call-up. ...

Tyson told The Associated Press on Saturday that Carolyn Donham broke her long public silence in an interview with him in 2008. His book, \u201cThe Blood of Emmett Till,\u201d comes out next week. \n \n\u201cShe told me that \u2018Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him,\u2018\u201d said Tyson, a Duke University research scholar whose previous books include \u201cBlood Done Sign My Name\u201d and \u201cRadio Free Dixie.\u201d \n \nEmmett Till was a 14-year-old black tortured and killed in 1955 in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman, then known as Carolyn Bryant. \n \nHis murder became national news, was a galvanizing event in the civil rights movement and has been the subject of numerous books and movies. During the trial, Bryant said that he had grabbed her, and, in profane terms, bragged about his history with white woman. The jury was not present when she testified. \n \nDonham\u2019s then-husband, Roy Bryant, and his half-brother, J.W. Milam, were acquitted by the all-white jury. Both men, who later told Look magazine they did murder Till, have since died. Milam\u2019s widow, Juanita Milam, would later tell the FBI she believed that Carolyn Bryant had fabricated her story. Juanita Milam died in 2014. The Justice Department re-examined the case a decade ago, but no one was indicted as a murderer or an accomplice. \n \nOn Saturday, the maker of a documentary on Till said he had long been sure that Bryant\u2019s story was false. \n \n\u201cHis mother had mentioned that Emmett had a speech impediment and that the things Bryant claimed he was saying he could not have said easily,\u201d said Keith Beauchamp, whose \u201cThe Untold Story of Emmett Till\u201d came out in 2005. \n \nTyson said that he spoke with Donham after her daughter-in-law, Marsha Bryant, contacted him. Bryant had read \u201cBlood Done Sign My Name,\u201d about a racist murder during his childhood in Oxford, North Carolina, and invited Tyson to meet with her and Donham. \n \nTyson said he and Donham had two conversations, both lasting 2-3 hours, and that he planned at the time to place the material in the archives at the University of North Carolina. Asked why he waited so long to publicize his findings, he responded that historians think in different terms than do journalists. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m more interested in what speaks to the ages than in what is the latest media thing,\u201d he said. \n \nHe added that he wasn\u2019t sure whether Donham knew about the book. He said he had fallen out of touch with the family and that when he last spoke with Bryant, a few years ago, she said Donham was in poor health. \n \nTill was a fun-loving teenager from Chicago visiting the Mississippi Delta and helping out on his great-uncle Mose Wright\u2019s farm. On Aug. 24, 1955, Till and some other kids drove to a local store, Bryant\u2019s, for refreshments. At Bryant\u2019s, some of the kids stayed on the porch, watching a game of checkers, while the others filed inside to buy bubble gum and sodas. Carolyn Bryant, the 21-year-old wife of proprietor Roy Bryant, was behind the counter. \n \nAccounts of what happened next differ. \n \nMrs. Bryant claimed Emmett bragged about dating white women up north. She said he grabbed her and asked her, \u201cHow about a date, baby?\u201d Simeon Wright, his cousin, heard none of this. But there is no doubt about what he heard when they left the store, he told the AP in 2005. \n \nStanding on the front porch, Emmett let out a wolf whistle. \n \nCarolyn Donham\u2019s whereabouts have long been a mystery, but North Carolina voter rolls list a Carolyn Holloway Donham. Holloway is her maiden name. \n \nThe address is for a green, split-level home in Raleigh at the mouth of a neat cul-de-sac just two turns off a busy four-lane thoroughfare. The well-tended house has burnt-orange shutters and a front-facing brick chimney decorated with a large metal sunburst.

And in this case, that was a good thing, executive director Maribeth Woodford said. \n \n\u201cBefore the Affordable Care Act, we had more people coming to our doors than we could manage,\u201d Woodford said, noting that the agency helped people sign up for coverage under the ACA so they could have a permanent medical home. \u201cWith the changes, we could give comprehensive care to our clients.\u201d \n \nBut with President Donald Trump and Republican leaders in Congress promising to undo the health insurance law, free clinic staff members are wondering if their doors soon will be overrun again. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely concerned because we are the safety net. When people discover they no longer have a viable health plan, they eventually come to us. We want everyone to have coverage,\u201d Woodford said. \u201cBut we, like everyone else, have to do the wait-and-see.\u201d \n \nNobody knows exactly what a promised replacement for the ACA will look like, although local health officials shared a few opinions about what they\u2019d like to see included. \n \nNo. 1 on that list is continued coverage for those who have it. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s important to all of the communities that Marshfield Clinic Health System and Security Health Plan serve that everybody still has access to coverage,\u201d said Marty Anderson, chief marketing officer for Security Health Plan, the health insurance affiliate of Marshfield Clinic and one of three carriers that offers policies through the ACA in the Chippewa Valley.  \n \nThat\u2019s particularly important for individuals with incomes just above the poverty line who don\u2019t have access to Medicaid coverage in Wisconsin, Anderson said. \n \nJulie Manas, president and CEO of HSHS Sacred Heart Hospital, expressed a similar sentiment.  \n \n\u201cHospital Sisters Health System strongly supports ensuring all people have access to high quality, affordable health care,\u201d Manas said in a statement. \u201cWhile we recognize that the Affordable Care Act is not perfect, it did extend insurance coverage to 21 million Americans, including more than 200,000 Wisconsin residents. The result of expanded health insurance coverage is that more people are receiving the right care, at the right time, in the right setting.\u201d \n \n\u2018No free lunch\u2019 \n \nIn response to fears that many of the millions of Americans who gained coverage under the ACA will lose it, Trump recently declared that his plan will provide \u201chealth care for everyone\u201d and lower deductibles. \n \nCount Eric Jamelske, an economics professor at UW-Eau Claire who teaches a course on health care economics, as a skeptic. He called such promises theoretically possible but practically improbable. \n \n\u201cThe reality is in economics we like to say there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch,\u201d Jamelske said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a world where all of a sudden everyone\u2019s covered. If it were that easy, wouldn\u2019t we have done it a long time ago?\u201d \n \nRobert Kraig, executive director of the liberal advocacy group Citizen Action of Wisconsin, said he likes the progressive-sounding campaign promises of lower costs and everyone having coverage but doesn\u2019t see how they become reality without a system heavily influenced by the federal government \u2014 something many conservatives don\u2019t support. \n \n\u201cIt really looks like bait and switch to me,\u201d Kraig said, noting that the consequences of allowing people to fall through the cracks and lose coverage could lead to life-and-death situations. \n \nHe said public pressure is important, and he encouraged people to hold politicians\u2019 feet to the fire and hold them accountable in future elections if they don\u2019t follow through on their promises about health care reform. \n \nRetaining features \n \nAt least one local health insurance official expressed confidence that any successor to the ACA will retain some of the law\u2019s most popular features, including provisions that prohibit insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and permit young people to remain covered by their parents\u2019 policies until turning 26. \n \n\u201cI have no doubt that those will be continued through whatever change occurs,\u201d said Peter Farrow, CEO and general manager of Group Health Cooperative of Eau Claire. \n \nWhat Farrow hopes the next round of health care reform addresses is the additional federal bureaucracy created by the ACA. That includes more paperwork requirements and more mandated services that he said have led to higher costs and reduced flexibility in the kind of policies businesses can offer their employees. \n \nFarrow, a former congressional Republican aide, also said he thinks GOP leaders may give states the freedom to pursue customized solutions.  \n \n\u201cI think we have leaders in Congress who recognize that once size fits all doesn\u2019t work for all states,\u201d he said. \n \nPatient focus \n \nDr. Randall Linton, president and CEO of Mayo Clinic Health System for northwestern Wisconsin, called for developing a value-based health care system that rewards patient outcomes rather than volume. \n \n\u201cFixing the Affordable Care Act is going to require a surgical approach with careful assessment, evaluation and action \u2014 with more focus on patients and treatments,\u201d Linton said in a statement. \n \nWhatever is agreed upon, Security Health Plan\u2019s Anderson doesn\u2019t expect to see any changes take place in 2017. In fact, open enrollment for 2017 coverage through the federal marketplace continues through Tuesday.  \n \nManas noted that the Springfield, Ill.-based HSHS absorbed nearly $92 million in reduced Medicare funding between 2010 and 2015, cuts she said were agreed to as a way to fund the ACA.  \n \n\u201cIf the ACA is repealed, we believe Medicare funding to hospitals should be restored to their pre-2010 levels, or the savings from a repeal of the ACA should be put into a special fund used to support a new version of health care reform that ensures access to care for all Americans,\u201d Manas said.   \n \nDespite the controversial nature of health insurance reform, Manas advocated an approach that almost everybody could agree on, calling for Congress and the Trump administration \u201cto work in a bipartisan manner to improve health care for all.\u201d \n \nContact: 715-833-9209, eric.lindquist@ecpc.com , @ealscoop on Twitter \n \n\u2014- \n \nThe deadline to sign up for 2017 health insurance coverage through the federal marketplace is Tuesday.

It says the parish is in a good position to grow and attract jobs in coastal restoration, aviation, food manufacturing and professional services such as engineering, accounting and law. \n \n\"This is a five-to-seven-year strategy, and you can't have a strategy that just ignores oil and gas, agriculture and seafood and the gains the parish has made in the medical field,\" Matt Rookard, TEDA's chief executive officer, told The Courier and Daily Comet in a story published a couple of weeks ago. \"We have a lot of work to do, and it's not going to all happen immediately, but we have a lot of ideas on how to do it.\" \n \nMakes sense to me.  \n \nNow, let's make it happen, right? \n \nPlease forgive that hint of sarcasm in my last sentence, but I have long been skeptical of so-called economic-development efforts, mainly because, at least around here, they rarely produce measurable economic development. To be fair, that is the case in lots of communities. \n \nOurs, as the study notes, faces significant and unique challenges that most others do not. For instance, focus groups cite high insurance costs as a significant deterrent to business growth. Predictions that the Gulf of Mexico will swallow almost half of Terrebonne over the next 30-50 years aren't going to make insurance any cheaper.  \n \nCoastal erosion, sinking land, rising seas and the threat of hurricanes six months of every year won't make it any easier to attract businesses outside the oil industry, which has a vested interest in being close to the Gulf. \n \nFocus groups also cited bad roads, bridges, sewer systems and the other infrastructure that, done well, can enhance not just business but life for everyone, as a challenge. And that won't be easy to fix in a state that stumbles from one financial crisis to the next instead of creating a sustainable plan matches tax dollars with priorities for public services. \n \nBut all is not lost. The plan offers a step-by-step plan aimed at generating new jobs. But making that happen will require somebody to step up and lead, accepting accountability for success or failure. If TEDA is going to lead, its board needs to make that clear to the public. It needs to tell residents how they will measure their own success and that of Rookard and his administration. And it will need to get public buy-in for an agency that I suspect many local residents have never heard of. \n \nFocus groups described a \"perceived inertia\" among decision makers that holds back the area. And that inertia is not limited to government officials but people in lots of leadership roles. \n \n\"To redirect the parish\u2019s trajectory for growth, leadership will need to be proactive and execute its economic development efforts differently,\" the study says. \"It will need to be a champion for long-term investments that will add to the parish\u2019s product and quality of place, as well as ensure that sufficient resources are available to fund such goals.\" \n \nIn essence, the best things the parish can do to attract business are the same kinds of things it can do to make it a better place for the people who already call it home. Better schools, better roads, tax system that addresses real priorities at a reasonable cost, stemming coastal erosion. Even the small stuff, like making the entry points to the parish look a little nicer than someone's messy tool shed, can make a difference. \n \n\"The status quo is not an option,\" the study concludes. \"By taking on actionable and measurable plans to focus its entrepreneurial, retention and attraction efforts, Terrebonne will become more competitive. With added focus, the parish can make huge strides in its economic development efforts and build the community it desires.\" \n \n-- Courier and Daily Comet Executive Editor Keith Magill can be reached at 857-2201 or keith.magill@houmatoday.com.

Dodig lost his serve in the opening game of the match after a forehand unforced error. \n \nSania too lost her first service game, third of the first set, as she was unable to return a backhand shot. \n \nThe Indo-Croatian pair took a while to get going and began to combine well in the later stages of the first set, winning their next two service games. But it wasn't enough to save the set, surrendering it 2-6. \n \nBut they stepped up their energy in the second set. Beginning to play more as a team, they attacked Spears' serve in the second game after Dodig won the first service game. \n \nThe pressure they applied paid dividends as Abigail-Cabal was hit a backhand volley wide to trail 0-2. Sania then held on to her serve to go 3-0 up. \n \nBut Sania-Dodig couldn't maintain the momentum. Sania was broken in the seventh game with a backhand volley winner. \n \nAbigail and Cabal held onto their serves to square the second set 4-4. \n \nDodig, yet to win a major title in mixed doubles, seemed nervous, owing to his relative inexperience in summit clashes. \n \nAnd he failed to control his nerves at crucial stages of the match, losing his serve in the ninth game with a double fault to trail 4-5. \n \nSpears served for the match in the 10th game and weren't subjected to much pressure, winning the championship with a forehand smash, which underlined their supremacy in the match. \n \nIt was Sania's second Australian Open mixed doubles final after winning in 2009 with compatriot Mahesh Bhupathi. \n \nPrior to Sunday's final, she won three mixed doubles titles, the last being the 2014 US Open with Brazilian Bruno Soares. \n \nThe 30-year-old Hyderabadi has six major titles in her kitty, three in mixed doubles and three in women's doubles. \n \nThe Indo-Croatian pair played their second grand slam final, having lost the French Open final to the experienced pair of Leander Paes and Martina Hingis last year. \n \nSania-Dodig had overcome a tough one-hour-18-minute battle in the semi-final against Aussies Samantha Stosur and Sam Groth 6-4, 2-6, (10-5) Friday. \n \nAbigail and Cabal had defeated Elina Svitolina of Ukraine and Aussie Chris Guiccione 7-6 (1), 6-2 in the last four stage.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Aus Open: unseeded Spears-Cabal stun Sania Mirza-Dodig in mixed doubles final","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Manorama Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169870963","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"154"},"name":"Manorama Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.manoramaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195605109","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We have also watched the sea level rise and our ground subside beneath us. \n \nFor far too long, our state and federal governments did nothing to offset this unsettling trend. \n \nBut that has begun to change. Chance hasn\u2019t come quickly, but the momentum away from inaction and toward urgent action has at least started. \n \nOur state government has embraced the notion of fighting for the survival of our coast and the betterment of all the people it protects. \n \nA 50-year plan is in place to guide coastal projects toward those that will do the most good with the least money. \n \nThe plan is estimated at $50 billion, and that money has not been secured.

More than 100 people showed up for it, and many were willing to voice their opinions on the plan. \n \nThe fact that so many people have been spurred to action out of concern for our coast shows that there is a growing public awareness of and concern over our plight. \n \nThat in itself is an improvement. \n \nThe next step will be for state officials to finalize the latest iteration of the plan and set about putting it into action. \n \nThat might not seem like a huge goal when the money to fully pay for the plan is still lacking.

Much of the money coming in from fines paid by BP for its part in the 2010 oil spill will go toward coastal restoration. The cash won\u2019t pay for all the projects in the plan, but it will create some progress. \n \nThat, too, is important. \n \nThe fact that we have stopped ignoring the problem and started addressing it is a major step in the right direction. The state\u2019s plan represents our best chance at keeping the most of us safe from future storms. \n \nNow, our challenge becomes getting the money to put fully implement the plan.

Dodig lost his serve in the opening game of the match after a forehand unforced error. \n \nSania too lost her first service game, third of the first set, as she was unable to return a backhand shot. \n \nThe Indo-Croatian pair took a while to get going and began to combine well in the later stages of the first set, winning their next two service games. But it wasn't enough to save the set, surrendering it 2-6. \n \nBut they stepped up their energy in the second set. Beginning to play more as a team, they attacked Spears' serve in the second game after Dodig won the first service game. \n \nThe pressure they applied paid dividends as Abigail-Cabal was hit a backhand volley wide to trail 0-2. Sania then held on to her serve to go 3-0 up. \n \nBut Sania-Dodig couldn't maintain the momentum. Sania was broken in the seventh game with a backhand volley winner. \n \nAbigail and Cabal held onto their serves to square the second set 4-4. \n \nDodig, yet to win a major title in mixed doubles, seemed nervous, owing to his relative inexperience in summit clashes. \n \nAnd he failed to control his nerves at crucial stages of the match, losing his serve in the ninth game with a double fault to trail 4-5. \n \nSpears served for the match in the 10th game and weren't subjected to much pressure, winning the championship with a forehand smash, which underlined their supremacy in the match. \n \nIt was Sania's second Australian Open mixed doubles final after winning in 2009 with compatriot Mahesh Bhupathi. \n \nPrior to Sunday's final, she won three mixed doubles titles, the last being the 2014 US Open with Brazilian Bruno Soares. \n \nThe 30-year-old Hyderabadi has six major titles in her kitty, three in mixed doubles and three in women's doubles. \n \nThe Indo-Croatian pair played their second grand slam final, having lost the French Open final to the experienced pair of Leander Paes and Martina Hingis last year. \n \nSania-Dodig had overcome a tough one-hour-18-minute battle in the semi-final against Aussies Samantha Stosur and Sam Groth 6-4, 2-6, (10-5) Friday. \n \nAbigail and Cabal had defeated Elina Svitolina of Ukraine and Aussie Chris Guiccione 7-6 (1), 6-2 in the last four stage.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Unseeded Spears-Cabal stun Sania Mirza-Dodig in mixed doubles final","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Manorama Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169870963","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"154"},"name":"Manorama Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Tennis","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.manoramaonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195607179","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:21Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The batsmen got starts but didn't convert that into a substantial innings and the bowlers had too few runs to defend. \n \nThe last time India played at Nagpur they were spun out by the New Zealanders and Mitchell Santner was making the ball turn at sharp angles. The pitch may be better this time around but it should turn a lot more than at the Eden Gardens (Kolkata) and Green Park (Kanpur). So Adil Rashid who didn't get to bowl at Kanpur may get to roll his arm over. Yuzvendra Chahal will be likely to exploit it more than his off-spinning partner Parvez Rasool who bowls too flat and a bit fast to get the ball to turn. \n  \nIt's India's batsmen though who have to win the game for their team. KL Rahul's form has dipped alarmingly and Nagpur provides a great opportunity to turn it around. Yuvraj Singh does not have to prove anything to anybody but he has set such high standards and such are the expectations from him especially in this format that unless he gets a few sixes in it's considered a failure. \n \nThe worry is the ease with which England cantered to the win in Kanpur. They were barely stretched and the way they plotted the dismissals of the Indians was terrific. Not much was given to the Indians in the arc of their bat swing which is what the Indian batsmen like. \n \nEngland's batting too hardly broke a sweat and skipper Eoin Morgan batted brilliantly. Like Yuvraj, he too can and does play the pull shot off the front foot and so the bowler has very little room for error on length. \n \nEngland have had a forgettable Test series and lost closely the one-day series and so they will want to finish the tour on a high with a win in the T20 series. They are looking very good indeed and the Indians will have to lift their game considerably if they want to thwart England's ambitions. \n \nStay updated on the go with Sify Live Scores App. Click here to download it for your device","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"'India need to get plenty right to stay in the series'","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Sify","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657349","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"9"},"name":"Sify","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.sify.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sify.sports"],"sequenceId":"695195615773","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:46:14Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/rb3lpIjcgicag.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Sania hit a backhand wide on the deciding point to concede the first set.\n\nDodig's serve was again under pressure as he faced a breakpoint and a deciding point in the first game of the second set but managed to save both.\n\nCabal served a double fault at 40-30 to face a deciding point and the second seeds latched on to that to take a 2-0 lead as Spears hit a backhand long.\n\nSania had an easy hold to make it 3-0 as the Indo-Croatian pair was back in the match. However, Sania was broken in the seventh game which allowed the rivals to neutralise the advantage.\n\nThe Indian committed a double fault to be down by two breakpoints and Spears smashed one overhead volley to convert the first. Spears held without fuss and the two pairs were now locked 4-4.\n\nDodig was never in his elements in Sunday's match and he served two double faults, the second one coming on a breakpoint, to allow Cabal to serve out the championship.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Deccan Chronicle"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Australian Open: Sania Mirza-Ivan Dodig fall...","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Dotemirates.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"609646081","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Dotemirates.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dotemirates.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195615982","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:30Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://dotemirates.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/2017/01/9495b44502081ccc72c76dcb187fb14f.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

For many, life in the U.S. is different from life in their home countries.\n\nFor Marianne Cortes, a student from Mexico, Kokomo High School is a big change from her hometown school, where the teachers rotate to different classrooms and the students sit at the same desks all day. She had to wear a uniform in Mexico, and she said it\u2019s a little overwhelming to have to decide what to wear each day.\n\nAlbanian student Rei Braja said there are more class options than he\u2019s used to. When he arrived at Kokomo High School, he didn\u2019t realize there were multiple chemistry and math classes, and he was confused by his class schedule at first.\n\nNguyen Tran, a student from Vietnam, said his school back home had a designated time for naps during the day. It\u2019s one thing he misses, he said, but he doesn\u2019t plan to go back. He hopes to graduate from Kokomo High School and go to college in the U.S.\n\nThe availability of physical education and sports is another big difference for many of the students. Valdir Anghinoni, a student from Brazil, said his former school doesn\u2019t offer sports. When he came to Kokomo, he decided to try out for the football team. He remembers the coach telling the group of high school students to watch one of the returning players. Within five minutes, that player had broken his arm. Anghinoni said he immediately grabbed his things and walked home. Football, it turned out, was not for him.\n\nThat story is one the students know well. Most of them live together in dorms downtown, cooking meals, playing games and socializing. Though most of them come from different countries, they are able to connect with and learn from each other.\n\n\u201cWe share a lot,\u201d Anghinoni said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re more like family,\u201d Cortes said. \u201cWe get to see each other every day, and we have family bonds.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to live in the dorms,\u201d Braja said. \u201cYou get more interaction. We go to movies, play soccer. That interaction is good.\u201d\n\nThe students in the dorms have host families they see on weekends, but some students prefer to live with host families instead of the downtown dorms.\n\nTeresa White is a host mother for Samuel Sfeir, a student from Brazil. White said she wanted to host an international student because of the exposure it could give her son, Blake White, a sophomore at the high school. White said she wanted her son to experience and learn from another culture. She said Sfeir was a good match because he wanted to live with a host family rather than in a dorm, but there are some challenges. Sfeir is still learning English, and he has trouble with slang words. However, she enjoys watching her son learn some Portuguese from Sfeir.\n\nThe students and host families aren\u2019t just learning languages, they\u2019re learning about other cultures. Many of the students were amazed by how the U.S. celebrates holidays, such as Christmas.\n\nCortes said she was shocked by how many gifts her host family gave her for Christmas. When New Year\u2019s rolled around, someone told Cortes that it\u2019s traditional to kiss a stranger at midnight. Cortes said she was worried she might have to kiss someone, but she preferred to skip that particular custom.\n\nWhite said Sfeir put his shoes in the hallway on New Year\u2019s Eve because in Brazil parents will put candy in children\u2019s shoes overnight. Braja said only children receive gifts during the holidays in Albania, so he was surprised to get a gift at all this Christmas.\n\nAnghinoni was surprised by the amount of food people eat over the holidays, especially Thanksgiving. Even outside of the holidays, the students said, there are several things the U.S. does differently when it comes to food. There are more pop choices at restaurants, for instance,.\n\nThe students said they are grateful for the experience to attend school in Kokomo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool to come here and learn a lot,\u201d Anghinoni said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard task to stay here one year, but I love it here.\u201d\n\nSome of them, including Tran and Braja, are hoping to graduate from Kokomo High School and attend college in the U.S. Tran hopes to move to Texas, where some of his family members live, and Braja hopes to move to New York for the same reason.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to get used to another culture,\u201d Tran said. \u201cI thought I would be homesick, but I don\u2019t think about it anymore. This feels like home now.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Caele Pemberton"},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Mexico news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Holidays, cuisine pique international students' interest","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Monroe","zipCode":"47401","state":"Indiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Bloomington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Herald-Times","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169734487","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2342"},"name":"Herald-Times","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldtimesonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195618312","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldtimesonline.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/80/0801be76-c0ce-5ec8-8506-0536e3fba498/588d86c2c9c48.image.jpg?resize=300%2C234"},{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldtimesonline.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/80/0801be76-c0ce-5ec8-8506-0536e3fba498/588d86c2c9c48.image.jpg?resize=769%2C600"}],"video":[]}}

His trial starts on 5 April. \n \nThe four-time prime minister remains the leader of the centre-right Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party. \n \nThe new charges stem from the previous case, when he was accused of having sex with Karima El Mahroug in 2010, when she was 17. \n \nThe Moroccan nightclub dancer became better known by her stage name, Ruby the Heartstealer, in the press. \n \nThe new trial will focus on the accusation that the billionaire businessman paid more than 10m euros (£8.5m; $10.7m), between 2011 and 2015, to get witnesses to testify in his favour. \n \nOver half of that money is alleged to have been spent on Ms El Mahroug. \n \nHe is said to have brought gifts and cars, and paid for housing, bills and medical expenses, for guests visiting his Milan mansion, where he held his \"bunga-bunga\" parties. \n \nHis lawyer, Federico Cecconi, has quipped that he must be on trial for generosity. \n \nIn Italy, the age of consent is 14, but paying for sex with a woman under 18 is seen as involvement in underage prostitution. \n \nBefore Mr Berlusconi's sentence was overturned, he was handed a seven-year jail term and banned from holding public office ever again. \n \nHowever, he was allowed to remain free pending the outcome of the appeal. \n \nHis connection to Ms El Mahroug was revealed after, in October 2010, it emerged that he had called a police station asking for her release. \n \nShe was being held for theft. \n \nMr Berlusconi has been embroiled in several high-profile legal battles. \n \nIn 2013, he was also convicted of tax fraud, and ejected from the Italian Senate.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Italy news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Witness bribery trial for Berlusconi","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"BBC","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587494","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1920"},"name":"BBC","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/","publisher":"British Broadcasting Corporation"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195619868","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:16:30Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:26Z","media":{"logo":[{"url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2015/newsspec_10857/bbc_news_logo.png?cb=1"}],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And Small Business Saturday was a busy day, said David Borlaug, president of the Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation, which runs the gallery. \n\n\"In spite of the bad weather, in terms of original art, sales have been great,\" he said. \"It validates Bismarck was ready for this kind of gallery.\" \n\nBorlaug said Bismarck has been \"blessed\" with a multitude of galleries, each with a different niche. Bismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative, Bismarck Art & Galleries Association and Gallery 522 all feature member artists' works. There's also Art Gallerie on Main, where Lydia Richez-Bowman features her own work and that of several other local artists, as well as teaching classes. \n\nBorlaug said Capital Gallery is focused on featuring two artists on its walls \u2014 one expressive and one traditional \u2014 along with several others who work in various other media, such as glass or bronze. The gallery sets itself apart by limiting the number of artists and featuring them for longer periods. And because it does not cater to member artists, \"the world's our oyster,\" he said. \n\nBorlaug has artists lined up for the foreseeable future, with Deane Collin Fay of Gackle alongside Bismarck native Vern Erickson's western Americana pieces coming up in Februarym The Bismarck Tribune (http://bit.ly/2joTPY3 ) reports. \n\n\"There is a thriving art culture in Bismarck,\" Borlaug said. \"We're just glad to be part of it.\" \n\nHe points to Jessica Wachter as an up-and-coming Bismarck artist who has a \"real following across the country,\" with works featured in galleries in Los Angeles and Scottsdale, Ariz. \n\nStephanie Delmore of Gallery 522 agrees. \n\n\"I think we're just getting to that point of there being enough galleries\" that they could partner on events, like gallery hops, she said. \"We can start to thread ourselves together.\" \n\nAs Bismarck's population has become more diverse, Delmore said there are more people who are used to going to galleries on a regular basis. \n\n\"I think the traffic is picking up,\" she said, with the public understanding what art adds to a community. \n\nSince starting 32 years ago, Gallery 522 has wanted all local artists to be able to show their work daily rather than wait five years for their turn at a larger show. \n\n\"We've always meant to be of service to artists,\" Delmore said, and on a day-to-day basis, the gallery has a multitude of artists covering its walls. \n\nBismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative works much the same way, though with slightly different rules and organization, while BAGA has become more well-known for hosting larger shows for its member artists, Delmore said. \n\n\"I think we've got a lovely base of artists in the area,\" she said, and having more galleries showcasing those artists could result in more art-focused events come spring. \n\nBorlaug said he thinks Bismarck is where Fargo was a couple decades ago in terms of growing from a big town to a small city \u2014 and art \"makes cities.\" \n\n\"I feel Bismarck is more than ready to grow its arts community,\" he said. \n\nIn turn, that community could help grow the city, attracting more residents. Borlaug said one of the first things people want to know about before moving somewhere is the arts scene: Is there a symphony? An orchestra? Visual arts? \n\n\"It could help get people to move here,\" he said, and the art produced here is helping tell this area's story. \n\n--- \n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com \n\nAP Member Exchange shared by The Bismarck Tribune.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JESSICA HOLDMANThe Bismarck Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Number of art galleries increases for Bismarck","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Saint Clair","zipCode":"62220","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Belleville","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Belleville News Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659187","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1944"},"name":"Belleville News Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.bnd.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2joTPY3","http://www.bismarcktribune.com/"],"sequenceId":"695195625116","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:23Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It is providing a significant portion of the funding that will make the Coastal Master Plan a reality. Any honest evaluation of the past, as well as the efforts to protect the future, will conclude that Louisiana\u2019s oil and natural gas industry has always been a partner in building our communities and working together on our coast. \n \nFor decades, Louisiana\u2019s leaders and its residents have understood when the oil and natural gas industry thrives the state thrives \u2013 with more and better paying jobs for hundreds of thousands of working families. \n \nIt is in the best interest of our state\u2019s culture and coast to have a safe, prospering oil and natural gas industry. \n \nA productive oil and natural gas industry creates revenue for Louisiana from royalties and taxes that fill the government coffers and provide the largest stream of consistent funding the state has for working on the coast. \n \nToday, there are dozens of major ongoing conservation projects funded by the industry happening across the coast with business, community, state and federal cooperation. The industry has contributed more than $4 billion to the state\u2019s coastal restoration since 2009, and the oil and natural gas industry will contribute an estimated $200 million a year for the foreseeable future to coastal projects. \n \nCurrently, a partnership between the New Orleans Geological Society and five Louisiana universities is using $200 million in industry data to conduct research of seismic faults along the Louisiana coast. Miles of oyster reefs have been created through cooperative programs between the industry and local communities. The largest private wetlands landowner in the U.S. \u2013 an energy company \u2013 is caring for wetlands extending 120 miles west to east from the Atchafalaya Basin to the Mississippi River. Another energy company planted more than 1 million trees in coastal and marsh lands. \n \nAt the Coastal Protection and Restoration Agency Coastal Master Plan public comment meeting in New Orleans on Jan. 18, a noted geologist reminded the audience that when the pyramids were built in Egypt, Louisiana\u2019s coastline was near Covington. This fact emphasizes that our coast is an evolving natural entity. At the same time, those who are planning and overseeing a comprehensive solution have agreed there are dozens of factors that contribute to the state of Louisiana\u2019s coastline, including the decision to construct levees along the Mississippi River, as well as movements of the earth\u2019s faults. \n \nThe spirit exemplified within the coastal plan is one of unity and collaboration for a common goal. We are all in this together, and it will take the concerted effort from all parties pulling in the same direction to make an impact along Louisiana\u2019s coast. Louisiana cannot afford to single out the group that is already the No. 1 private investor in our coast and the largest employer in our state. \n \nSelectively attacking the industry that represents $3 billion in annual taxes paid to the state and one of every six jobs here tells the thousands of Louisiana-based businesses and hundreds of thousands of Louisianans that the state would rather sue this industry than work with it. \n \nThe best solution is not in a courtroom. It\u2019s working with the best science available, which the industry has, and investing our financial resources, which the industry is doing and has done for decades, into projects that can ensure both a protected coast and a working coast. \n \nMarc Ehrhardt is executive director of the Grow Louisiana Coalition.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Marc Ehrhardt Guest Columnist"},"topics":[{"name":"Energy industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Oil and gas news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Opinion: Oil industry is doing its part for the coast","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Terrebonne","zipCode":"70360","state":"Louisiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Houma","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Houma Today","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169670432","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"453"},"name":"Houma Today","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.houmatoday.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195631339","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Additionally, there has been as such the development of renewable energy capacities in the countries such as South Africa and Kenya,\" he said. \n \nHe further stated that various APRM member states continue to implement mega infrastructure projects with regional, even continental dimension, which he said are critical part of Africa's regional integration agenda. \n \nKenyatta has also lauded the positive gains in reducing maternal mortality rate, which he said has decreased by 49 percent across sub-Saharan Africa. \n \n\"The massive growth in information and communication technology across the continent is enabling countries such as Mali, Kenya, Ghana, and Nigeria to leap frog in areas such as financial inclusion, telemedicine and political participation,\" he said. \n \nHowever, Kenyatta underlined the need to make faster progress in reducing youth unemployment by harnessing the potential of the large population of young people in the continent. \n \n\"All of these positive developments should energize all of us and strengthen our collective resolve to continue promoting good governance, without which development would be impossible to achieve; that is why recent conflicts in the Central African Republic, in Burundi, in South Sudan, and in Somalia reminds us that we require urgent home-grown remedial responses,\" he underlined. \n \nKenyatta has also reiterated that the African continent has challenges of terrorism, climate change, corruption, and illicit financial flows. \n \nHe also called for action for greater intra-Africa trade. \n \n\"Our continent is also still grappling with challenges perpetuated by terrorist groups such as Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab, and the emergence of ISIS in the Saharan region of Africa, corruption also and illicit flow of funds,\" he said. \n \n\"Africa is one of the most vulnerable continents to climate variability and change; our continent faces increased threat from extreme phenomena such as storms, flooding, in its coastal regions sustained drought which impact on food, water security, ecosystems, health, infrastructure and migration.\" \n \n\"Under the circumstances, we have no choice but increasingly mainstream critical elements of environmental governance in the core focus areas of APRM, even as we coordinate specialized agencies tackling climate change in our continent,\" he said. \n \n\"Revitalizing the APRM, therefore, should take a more active role in devising solutions for the challenges cited above,\" he added. \n \nsource: xinhua","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Kenya news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Africa news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Kenyan president urges collective resolve in promoting\u2026","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Arabstoday.net","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"195129065","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Arabstoday.net","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.arabstoday.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.arabtoday.net/news-42/al-shabab-kenya-claim-dozens-of-deaths-in-somalia-attack-063723","http://www.arabtoday.net/travel-286/kenyan-authorities-withdraw-approval-to-allow-third-daily-flight-234239"],"sequenceId":"695195637878","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:24Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

With an estimated 5 million people nationwide affected by this incurable memory disorder, the key to helping people thrive often lies in learning how to effectively communicate as a caregiver. \n\n\u201cKeeping an open line of communication, even as symptoms progress, is important for ensuring a loved one receives a high level of care and his or her needs are adequately met,\u201d says Trent Quinn, founder, president and CEO of The Cottages. \u201cAs symptoms do progress, there are simple tips that can help keep the lines of communication open to ensure loved ones are able to articulate their thoughts, needs and desires.\u201d \n\nQuinn and many other providers of care for people living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease recommend keeping these things in mind when communicating with loved ones: \n\n\u2022 Exercise understanding \u2013 People living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease may not always say what they mean or what others expect them to. Rather than get upset or take comments personally, it\u2019s strongly urged that caregivers take a deep breath in these situations, regroup and move on. \n\n\u2022 Avoid the temptation to correct \u2013 Forgetfulness is a common symptom associated with Alzheimer\u2019s. Constantly correcting a loved one, however, can lead to agitation and may upset the daily routine. To keep things on a calm and even keel, it\u2019s best to avoid the temptation to correct. \n\n\u2022 Let the person live in the moment \u2013 For people living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, memories from 40 years ago might be more vivid and real that what is happening in the here and now. When this occurs, simply let them live in the moment and remember to avoid that urge to correct. \n\n\u201cCompassion and understanding go a long way toward keeping the lines of communication open with loved ones living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cListen to their thoughts, requests, needs and concerns with an open mind and open heart. Doing so can help them \u2013 and you \u2013 enjoy a higher quality of life.\u201d \n\nFor more information about The Cottages and the services it provides, visit it online at Alzcottages.com. \n\nAbout The Cottages \n\nThe Cottages is dedicated to care for those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other memory disorders.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2576","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Bowral","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Southern Highland News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"351646242","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Southern Highland News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.southernhighlandnews.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195663410","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council.

We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs\u201d.  \u201dProtection\u201d, he said, \u201cwill lead to great prosperity and strength\u201d. \nAs I pointed out in my last commentary, the 14 independent Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries have no need to fear on trade in goods with the US.  America has consistently enjoyed a balance of trade surplus with CARICOM, reaching US$4.17 billion in 2015, and likely to have been higher in 2016.  On this score, President Trump can have no quarrel with the Caribbean. \nWe should be clear.  Mr. Trump is the elected President of the US, according to the country\u2019s laws.  He is, therefore, entitled to implement the policies on which he campaigned, and in support of which he was elected. \nHowever, there are other policies that President Trump is pursuing that could affect the Caribbean adversely and these require urgent attention by CARICOM governments and active engagement with the US government. Below, I discuss some of these policies and their implications for the region. \nCLIMATE CHANGE AND SEA LEVEL RISE: President Trump has abandoned the previous administration\u2019s stance on global Climate Change efforts.  Evidence of this are: (a) his public statements during the Presidential election campaign; (b) his nomination of Scott Pruitt, a long-time foe of the EPA who has led 14 lawsuits against it, as the agency\u2019s administrator; and (c) his instruction to the Environmental Protection Agency to remove the climate change page from its website. \nThe medium and long term consequences for Caribbean countries are grave.  Global warming is already at 1.89 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels.  If there is no massive reduction in carbon emissions (which there will clearly not be now) by the US, the world will quickly reach 2 degrees Celsius, at which point sea levels will rise, eroding the coastal area of islands and mainland territories such as Belize and Guyana, that are the principal revenue-generating areas for tourism (agriculture in Guyana\u2019s case).  Lower level islands will be drowned.  The economic impact on the Caribbean would be calamitous if not catastrophic. \nREPATRIATION OF OVERSEAS FUNDS:   The Trump administration proposes to introduce a tax repatriation plan that would see repatriation of a substantial portion of the estimated US$2.6 trillion held overseas.  This is very likely to happen, since the incentive will be a special one-off tax holiday, allowing U.S. firms to repatriate funds held overseas with only a 10% payment, versus the current 35% rate. \nThe effect of this will be to debilitate Caribbean financial institutions that legally hold US assets.  There is bound to be some consequential weakening of the financial sector. \nREDUCTION OF CORPORATION TAX:  President Trump has announced that his administration will lower corporation tax to 15%.  When he does this, there will be little need for US Corporations to move overseas.  They will be operating in the richest economy in the world with the lowest tax (a virtual tax haven by OECD criteria). \nHere are the likely results: (i) a lower corporate tax rate won\u2019t necessarily reduce corporate tax revenue, particularly as over time there will be more investment and job creation; (ii) a lower corporate tax rate will dramatically \u2013 if not completely \u2013 eliminate any incentive for American companies to engage in keeping funds overseas; and (c) a lower corporate tax rate will boost workers\u2019 wages by increasing the country\u2019s capital stock and thus improving productivity. \nIt will become very tough for every other country, including the Caribbean, to woo US investment unless their tax regime for such investment betters 15% (which the Caribbean does now with tax holidays) but the Caribbean would have to work energetically to maximise US investment in unique natural resources \u2013 high quality beaches in a Caribbean environment; minerals such as oil and gas and, in the case of Guyana, gold. \nOECD AND G20 RULES: Rules of these organisations place strictures on tax competition and demand common reporting standards.  These rules are rigidly applied against Caribbean and other developing countries.   Countries that fail to comply are blacklisted, affecting their capacity to operate in the international economy. \nPresident Trump is clearly putting \u201cAmerica first\u201d in all this, as his country has the power to do.  Caribbean countries will have to carefully consider whether they can follow the advice of Mr. Trump in his inauguration speech \u2013 \u201cit is the right of all nations to put their own interests first\u201d \u2013 or will a double standard apply in which only powerful countries can set aside rules that do not serve their national interest.   To be fair to President Trump, his administration did not contribute to the existing rules. \nDEPORTATION OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS: The new US administration intends to deport undocumented immigrants to their country of origin.   If there are any undocumented CARICOM nationals, they will suffer that fate.   On January 25, Trump signed executive orders that reinstates the Secure Communities Programme which Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the branch of the U.S. government that enforces immigration laws, uses to target undocumented immigrants.  The Order also directs the State Department to withhold visas or take other measures to ensure that countries take back their undocumented immigrants.  It also strips federal grant money from any US city that harbours undocumented immigrants through sanctuary laws. \nIn this situation, Caribbean countries can expect to have an influx of undocumented immigrants.   The only way they can prevent this is by refusing to take them.   The consequence of that action is that the US will not grant visas of any kind to the nationals of the refusing countries. There may be other sanctions. \nCARICOM countries should consider the immediate establishment of national Committees at a senior level to plan for an influx of undocumented immigrants from the US.   These immigrants will be of all sorts, but the majority will be unskilled labourers and many will be below the age of 40.   Failure to plan could result in a sudden increase in the population of each country, driving up unemployment and crime, and straining their health facilities; their capacity for delivering water; and the capability of their courts, prisons and police. \nIndividually and collectively, Caribbean governments have to engage the Trump administration and the US Congress to discuss these worrying developments that have implications for the region, but also for the US. \n \n(The writer is Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s Ambassador to the United States and the OAS.

NIOSH estimates that more than 13 million U.S. workers are potentially exposed to chemicals that can be absorbed through their skin. Workers at risk of occupational skin diseases include those in construction, health care, agriculture, food service, auto repair and cosmetology. \n \n\u201cDermal exposure to hazardous agents can result in a variety of occupational diseases and disorders, including occupational skin diseases (OSD) and systemic toxicity,\u201d NIOSH states. The agency goes on to note that past efforts to control hazardous chemicals in the workplace largely focused on inhalation exposure. This means that although prevention strategies and methods are well-developed for inhalation risks, standardized methods are \u201ccurrently lacking\u201d for measuring and assessing chemical-related skin exposure. \n \nWhat you need to know \n \nOccupational skin diseases can take several forms, including irritant contact dermatitis; allergic contact dermatitis; skin cancers, infections and injuries; and other skin diseases. Contact dermatitis \u2013 also known as eczema \u2013 is the most commonly reported occupational skin disease. Symptoms include painful and itchy skin, blisters, redness, and swelling. \n \nOccupational skin diseases and disorders most often are caused by chemical agents by way of either primary irritants or sensitizers. Primary irritants act directly on a worker\u2019s skin through chemical reactions, while sensitizers \u2013 through repeated exposure \u2013 can result in allergic reactions. Workers\u2019 skin can be exposed to chemicals through direct contact with a contaminated surface, inhaling aerosols, immersion and splashes. \n \nPrevention \n \nFortunately for workers, dermal exposure can be controlled or prevented. One method, OSHA notes, is switching the chemical being used to something less volatile. Another option is re-designing the work process to help avoid splashes and immersion risks. \u201cWhere that is not feasible, personal protection in the form of chemical protective gloves, an apron or clothing should be selected,\u201d the agency states. In addition, practicing good housekeeping can help prevent the accumulation of dermally toxic contaminants on work surfaces. \n \nGo to www.osha.gov/SLTC/dermalexposure/prevention.html for more information from OSHA on dermal exposure prevention.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Occupational skin diseases: More common than you think","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Safety Health Magazine","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"465671275","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"684"},"name":"Safety Health Magazine","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Industrials"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/dermalexposure/prevention.html"],"sequenceId":"695195677783","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2790","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Lithgow","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Lithgow Mercury","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"270452585","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Lithgow Mercury","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.lithgowmercury.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195686384","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

A super positive start from Scotland saw them complete 15 passes to Fiji's zero.\n\nFirst blood eventually went to Scotland. After more than two minutes of possession, Scotland were rewarded with a try. It was a lovely run from George Horne that cut Fiji open, but the Pacific Islanders fired back courtesy of Kalione Nasoko, after entering their opponents' 22 for the first time. After scoring their try, Nasoko is sent to the bin for a high tackle and Mark Robertson made him pay - 12-7 to Scotland at the break.\n\nThe second half was just as intense as the first, with both teams getting clear opportunities and also producing some desperate defence. The decisive moment in the game was when Scotland gifted Fiji possession with a forward pass with fewer than three minutes remaining. Alivereti Veitokani picked up the ball and Jamie Farndale mistimed his tackle, which allows Veitokani to level the scores. Osea Kolinisau converted for the lead. Joeli Lutumailagi then sealed the win with a fourth try.\n\nSouth Africa made Canada pay for an early mistake - a spilled pass picked up and Seabelo Senatla sprinting 70 metres for the opening score, equalling the BlitzBoks' all-time try-scoring record of .\n\nThe BlirtzBoks' second try came right at the end of the first half - a period of sustained defence pressure forced Canada into another mistake and this time Albertus Smith picked up the ball and sprinted 20-odd metres for the score - 14-0 at the break.\n\nIt was yet another Canadian mistake - illegally flopping on trhe ball at a ruck - that saw Werner Kock sprint 80 metres for SA's third try soon after the restart. Canada eventually got on the board 90 seconds from full-time - Adam Zaruba finishing off a fine team try. The BlitzBoks eased into the Final with a 21-5 victory.\n\nResults:\n\nScotland 12-19 Fiji\n\nCanada 5-21 South Africa\n\nFifth-place play-off \n\nLocals will tell you it is a glimpse of New Zealand's future, after 18-year-old Vilimoni Koroi beat England sweeper Tom Mitchell and set up his captain Scott Curry to break the deadlock. A lovely floated pass by Koroi cut out Sherwin Stowers and found Regan Ware right on the money. With Dylan Collier dragging two defenders inside, Ware had an untroubled run to the line - 12-0 to the hosts at half-time.\n\nIt was a numbers as the second half started. A long pass found Iopu Iopu-Aso and he was across in the corner. A thumping DJ Forbes tackle win a turnover and Vilimoni Koroi threw a lovely pass to Sherwin Stowers, who sealed the win with a fourth try inside the last minute.\n\nLuciano Gonzalez Rizzoni displayed some fancy footwork to jink inside and out, landing his third try of the weekend - as Argentina took an early lead in the second fifth place play-off match. France, who were scoreless in their Cup quarterfinal defeat to South Africa, then hit back twice - as Stephen Parez picked up a desperate offload to ground his third try of the weekend, before Sacha Valleau scored another five-pointer.\n\nArgentina's 19-year-old star Luciano Gonzalez Rizzoni scored a second with more deft footwork that left France's Stephen Parez bamboozled on the floor. The Los Pumas Sevens made twice as many tackles as France in this contest and will battle with New Zealand for fifth place.\n\nResults:\n\nEngland 0-24 New Zealand\n\nArgentina 19-14 France\n\nChallenge Trophy semifinals \n\nIn the first Challenge Trophy semifinal Kenya's Daniel Sikuta fended off a tackle to open the scoring against the United Stares. The USA Sevens Eagles struck back, as speedster Perry Baker, so smooth across the field and with exceptional balance, tore up the grass in front of him and rocketed in under the posts. Billy Odhiambo brought up his 60th Sevens Series try despite a last-ditch effort by Danny Barrett to stop him, and the powerful Kenya No.5 was too quick for the USA defence again as he goes over for his fifth try of the weekend. Kenya eventually advanced to the Challenge Trophy Final with a 19-12 win.\n\nIn the second semifinal captain Sam Myers had a nice free run-in to dot down his 40th Sevens Series career try, as Andy Friend's Australian side raced out the starting blocks against Wales. Australia's 18-year-old debutant Tate McDermott scored his second try of the weekend after another fast Australian move. Charlie Taylor turned on the gas on the flank after more good work by McDermott. Despite two late tries there was no coming back for Wales and Australia will meet Kenya in the Challenge Trophy Final.\n\nResults:\n\nKenya 19-12 United States\n\nWales 10-24 Australia\n\nThirteenth-place play-off \n\nRussia were rewarded for some good, accurate passing and showed how destructive they can be with the ball in hand if you give them too much space. Ivan Kotov broke the deadlock and Roman Roshchin punished some slack Japanese defending. Ivan Kotov went over again for Russia, before a proud personal moment for Honeti Taumohaapai, who demonstrated excellent handling to juggle the ball under control and land his first-ever Sevens Series try. It's a first win of the weekend for Russia, though, who will contest the 13th place play-off.\n\nThe second 13th-place play-off between Papa New Guinea and Samoa saw Tofatu Solia bag a brace inside the first two and a half minutes. He was too big, too powerful and got a full head of steam on both occasions to roar his men into a 14-0 lead. Lafaele Vaa scored a third - his 18th Sevens Series try. Freddy Rova scored his first-ever Sevens Series try, on debut, as Samoa took a 28-7 lead into the break. Samoa made sure they will continue to contest 13th place play-off with Russia, following a clinical dispatching of Papa New Guinea.\n\nResults:\n\nRussia 15-5 Japan\n\nPapua New Guinea 7-35 Samoa Rugby365.com Rugby365","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Fiji news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Russia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"South Africa news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"South Pacific Islands news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"France news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"BlitzBoks to meet Fiji in Final","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"IAfrica.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169667708","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"814"},"name":"IAfrica.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.iafrica.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195690671","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://sport.iafrica.com/apps/imageUtil/view/article/1043977/1/630x385/"}],"video":[]}}

As part of a closer look at this lost decorative art, Ulysse Nardin will launch a new edition Classico Manufacture with a blue 'Grand Feu' enamel dial.\n\nThe timepiece upholds the three fundamentals upon which Ulysse Nardin has built its reputation as a mechanical watchmaker: independent manufacturing, rare craftsmanship and an unceasing quest for innovation.\n\nThis Classico Manufacture is powered by the self-winding UN-320 caliber, a movement entirely designed and produced in-house by the Swiss manufacture. It incorporates the celebrated silicium hairspring and anchor es-capement, also designed and manufactured in-house. In fact, Ulysse Nardin pioneered the use of silicium parts in mechanical watchmaking, being the first to identify the advanced material's potential for improved precision and durability before others followed suit.\n\nThe second pillar of Ulysse Nardin's unique savoir-faire is evident in the artistry of the 'Grand Feu' enamel dial. Created by the Ulysse Nardin company, Donzé Cadrans, specialists in the fine art of enameling, this 'Grand Feu' enamel dial is a stunning blue. Only a handful of craftsmen have the necessary skill to master this 17th-century technique, and the blue dial of the Classico Manufacture 'Grand Feu', with its delicately translucid quality, is a fi-ne example of this challenging art.\n\nThe UN-320 movement and 'Grand Feu' enamel dial are set in a chic 40 mm stainless-steel case with a leather strap. The overall effect is one of streamlined simplicity: the hour and minute hands point to classic roman numer-al indexes, completed with a small seconds counter at 6 o'clock. Within lies a round date window: the wearer can easily set the date forwards or backwards, an incredible achievement for a mechanical watch.\n\nWith a competitive price point, the latest edition Classico Manufacture 'Grand Feu' is a more accessible expression of Ulysse Nardin's DNA: craftsmanship rooted in tradition, and savoir-faire anchored in innovation.\n\nTECHNICAL DATA\n\nReference\n\n3203-136-2/E3\n\nMovement\n\nCaliber UN-320, 11 ½''' In-house designed movement, with Ulysse Nardin certificate Silicium hairspring and anchor escapement 39 jewels \n\nPower-Reserve\n\napproximately 48 h \n\nWinding\n\nself-winding \n\nFunctions\n\nH/M/s/D small seconds-hand counter at 6 o'clock Forward and backward date corrector \n\nCase\n\nstainless steel, extra flat: 9.60 mm \n\nDial\n\nblue \u201cGrand Feu\u201d enamel with white roman numerals \n\nDiameter\n\n40 mm \n\nWater-resistance\n\n30 m \n\nCrystal\n\nanti-reflective sapphire crystal \n\nCase-back\n\nscrewed open case back with sapphire crystal \n\nStrap\n\nleather strap with a tang buckle","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Ulysse Nardin highlights the exquisite art of enameling with a ...","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"GoDubai.com","feed":{"genre":"Press Release","tags":[],"id":"202689383","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"GoDubai.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Lifestyle","Wires","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.godubai.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195694301","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And Small Business Saturday was a busy day, said David Borlaug, president of the Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation, which runs the gallery. \n\n\"In spite of the bad weather, in terms of original art, sales have been great,\" he said. \"It validates Bismarck was ready for this kind of gallery.\" \n\nBorlaug said Bismarck has been \"blessed\" with a multitude of galleries, each with a different niche. Bismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative, Bismarck Art & Galleries Association and Gallery 522 all feature member artists' works. There's also Art Gallerie on Main, where Lydia Richez-Bowman features her own work and that of several other local artists, as well as teaching classes. \n\nBorlaug said Capital Gallery is focused on featuring two artists on its walls \u2014 one expressive and one traditional \u2014 along with several others who work in various other media, such as glass or bronze. The gallery sets itself apart by limiting the number of artists and featuring them for longer periods. And because it does not cater to member artists, \"the world's our oyster,\" he said. \n\nBorlaug has artists lined up for the foreseeable future, with Deane Collin Fay of Gackle alongside Bismarck native Vern Erickson's western Americana pieces coming up in Februarym The Bismarck Tribune (http://bit.ly/2joTPY3 ) reports. \n\n\"There is a thriving art culture in Bismarck,\" Borlaug said. \"We're just glad to be part of it.\" \n\nHe points to Jessica Wachter as an up-and-coming Bismarck artist who has a \"real following across the country,\" with works featured in galleries in Los Angeles and Scottsdale, Ariz. \n\nStephanie Delmore of Gallery 522 agrees. \n\n\"I think we're just getting to that point of there being enough galleries\" that they could partner on events, like gallery hops, she said. \"We can start to thread ourselves together.\" \n\nAs Bismarck's population has become more diverse, Delmore said there are more people who are used to going to galleries on a regular basis. \n\n\"I think the traffic is picking up,\" she said, with the public understanding what art adds to a community. \n\nSince starting 32 years ago, Gallery 522 has wanted all local artists to be able to show their work daily rather than wait five years for their turn at a larger show. \n\n\"We've always meant to be of service to artists,\" Delmore said, and on a day-to-day basis, the gallery has a multitude of artists covering its walls. \n\nBismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative works much the same way, though with slightly different rules and organization, while BAGA has become more well-known for hosting larger shows for its member artists, Delmore said. \n\n\"I think we've got a lovely base of artists in the area,\" she said, and having more galleries showcasing those artists could result in more art-focused events come spring. \n\nBorlaug said he thinks Bismarck is where Fargo was a couple decades ago in terms of growing from a big town to a small city \u2014 and art \"makes cities.\" \n\n\"I feel Bismarck is more than ready to grow its arts community,\" he said. \n\nIn turn, that community could help grow the city, attracting more residents. Borlaug said one of the first things people want to know about before moving somewhere is the arts scene: Is there a symphony? An orchestra? Visual arts? \n\n\"It could help get people to move here,\" he said, and the art produced here is helping tell this area's story. \n\n--- \n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com \n\nAP Member Exchange shared by The Bismarck Tribune.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"JESSICA HOLDMANThe Bismarck Tribune"},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"},{"name":"Entertainment: fine arts news","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Number of art galleries increases for Bismarck","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"York","zipCode":"29730","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Rock Hill","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Rock Hill Herald","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657448","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1027"},"name":"Rock Hill Herald","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.heraldonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://bit.ly/2joTPY3","http://www.bismarcktribune.com/"],"sequenceId":"695195699020","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Seven days later, norms and doctrine that have guided the United States for decades are being re-examined. \n\nTrump's down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address: a call to arms that tested old distinctions between left and right. \n\n\"Today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another,\" he said. \n\n\"We are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.\" \n\n\n\nUS President Donald Trump's down-to-the-studs gut job began with a feisty inaugural address: a call to arms for the era of \"America first\" \n\nThe establishment \"elites\" in big cities, in politics and the media were no longer the technocrats in charge of the world's only superpower, they were the enemy. \n\nThe new president also put the rest of the world on notice. \n\nFor the last 75 years, America had been what Barack Obama described as the \"indispensable nation\" -- the glue that bound the global order. \n\nThe era of Trump would be the era of \"America first,\" he said, of naked self-interest and zero-sum diplomacy. Old alliances would be reassessed, new alliances would be explored. \n\nBefore his inauguration, many asked if the presidency would change Donald Trump, or whether Donald Trump would change the presidency. \n\nBarely 20 minutes into his four-year term, anyone who was listening had their answer. \n\n\n\nKeeping Trump's campaign promises \n\nBefore arriving at the Oval Office, Trump's strategists had decided to use the first few weeks to unleash a daily wave of executive orders. \n\nThe aim was to unbalance opponents, define Trump as a man of action and slake his supporters' thirst for change. \n\nFor much of middle America, globalization, automation and the Great Recession had been apocalyptic. \n\nPolitics had passed them over and worse, they felt steamrollered by \"coastal elites\" in America's \"culture wars\" over abortion, gay rights, immigration, global warming and religion. \n\nTrump had won the election by promising to be their champion, and he was going to -- as Ronald Reagan said -- \"dance with the one that brung ya.\" \n\nFor the most part, the CEO-in-chief put forward actions that could have come from any Republican in the country: defunding abortion, preening the military and approving oil pipelines. \n\nBut it was coated with a thick veneer of nationalist and populist rhetoric, and accompanying policies championed by top aide Steve Bannon. \n\n\n\nTrump ripped up a trans-Pacific trade deal designed to counterbalance China's regional economic power, imposed a ban on refugees from Syria and migrants from seven other Muslim countries. \n\nHe ordered planning to begin to build a wall on Mexico's southern border and picked a very public fight with Mexico's president Enrique Pena Nieto, who cancelled a trip to Washington. \n\nThe United States, a nation founded by migrants, was now willing to shut its doors. \n\nNot since Obama's election or perhaps the Iraq War has America's image around the world changed so dramatically and so quickly. \n\nBut Trump supporters saw an outsider sticking up for them and sticking it to the elites. \n\n\"Get used to it,\" said Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, boasting that Trump had delivered a \"shock to the system.\" \n\n\"And he's just getting started,\" she said. \n\n- Rocky start - \n\nBut it was not all positive for Trump. The White House is far from purring. Key positions have yet to be filled and the decision making process is haphazard. \n\nTrump aides were forced to publicly row back suggestions of a 20 percent border tax on Mexican goods and defend a chaotic rollout of the refugee and migrant ban. \n\n\n\nThroughout the week, Trump engaged in intemperate outbursts about the size of his inaugural crowd, alleged election fraud and perceived media persecution. \n\nPrivately, in call after call, he complained to top aides about press coverage. The impression was of a man focused on his image more than running the country. \n\nTrump also seemed like a a man for whom becoming US president was not adulation enough. \n\nSpokesman Sean Spicer -- between tirades and missteps -- offered a window onto the soul of the White House. \n\n\"There's this constant theme to undercut the enormous support he has,\" Spicer said. \n\n\"It's unbelievably frustrating when you're continually told it's not big enough; it's not good enough. You can't win.\" \n\nAccording to a Quinnipiac poll, Trump's approval rating at the end of his first week stood at 36 percent. \n\nBut critics saw a more sinister motive for the outbursts, particularly Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that three million people voted illegally in the election. \n\nBrian Klaas, an expert on global democracy at the London School of Economics, sees Trump \"casting aspersions (without evidence) on electoral integrity is a key way to restrict voting rights and erode confidence in elections.\" \n\n\"Attacking the media and blurring the lines of truth with state narratives not grounded in fact is important to sowing public doubt,\" he said. \n\nMindy Finn, who ran as a independent vice presidential candidate, summed up Trump's strategy as \"sow chaos, deepen division and consolidate power.\" \n\nFor his harshest critics, the question is now whether Donald Trump breaks the presidency, or whether the presidency breaks Donald Trump.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Donal Trump: U.S president's first week in power","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Pulse.ng","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"536981827","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1074"},"name":"Pulse.ng","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://pulse.ng"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://catalogue.afp.com/__assets/english/shared/top/01f076ab043b54974c18863576f41e8ee5f92653.jpg","http://catalogue.afp.com/__assets/english/shared/top/de3bc1bd5a4c2de19388be2e8d4ca87018b53519.jpg","http://catalogue.afp.com/__assets/english/shared/top/ad76c9f2442fc089c784cbccdaa7d9ab0eb31ce7.jpg","http://catalogue.afp.com/__assets/english/shared/top/26f1e38a106f7d2684ef1156001533664fb29145.jpg"],"sequenceId":"695195700192","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:10:04Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:58Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://catalogue.afp.com/__assets/english/shared/top/1e77cb68c202613b8c4864ba78a2d7fb36e0c384.jpg"},{"url":"http://catalogue.afp.com/__assets/english/shared/top/36e639a14b10755ab1365cd3dc8421ae0632f8d3.jpg"},{"url":"http://static.pulse.ng/img/politics/crop6088717/5725293455-chorizontal-w1600/from-this-moment-on-its-going-to-be-america-first-heres-president-donald-trumps-full-inauguration-speech.png"},{"url":"http://catalogue.afp.com/__assets/english/shared/top/21338fb33c9de411220e01294469c623667c467b.jpg"},{"url":"http://catalogue.afp.com/__assets/english/shared/top/c95bff7ccb0e95ee8455c0311b99b13761c42e68.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

As recently as 2016, Pruitt wrote the debate over global warming \u201cis far from settled.\u201d \n   \nPruitt is the attorney general in Oklahoma, where hundreds of earthquakes triggered by hydraulic fracturing (\u201cfracking\u201d) for oil and gas have been shaking the state apart. Despite the extensive damage from these fracking-generated quakes, the strongest statement Pruitt would make at his confirmation hearing, under questioning by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is \u201cI\u2019ve acknowledged that I am concerned.\u201d \n   \nWe are concerned about the consequences for the world\u2019s environment and for upstate New York if the United States fails to lead the effort to slow the pace of climate change. Big changes have already taken place, but even bigger ones \u2014 such as sea level rises that would have a catastrophic effect on oceanside communities \u2014 will take place without a concerted worldwide effort. \n   \n\u201cOceanside communities\u201d in the context of rising sea levels does not refer just to Key West and American Samoa. More than half of the world\u2019s great cities are near the ocean and hundreds of millions of people live in low-lying coastal areas. \n   \nIt makes sense that the co-chairmen of the Climate Solutions Caucus, Ted Deutch and Carlos Curbelo, are both from Florida. It also makes sense that climate change skeptic Pruitt is from landlocked Oklahoma. \n   \nHere in Stefanik\u2019s district, we also are landlocked, but we are affected by climate change in countless ways, from the increase in tick-borne diseases among upstate residents to the struggles of snow-dependent businesses like ski centers and snowmobile dealerships. \n   \nWe consider Congresswoman Stefanik\u2019s alliance with the Climate Solutions Caucus a good start, but no more. \n   \n\u201cWe have a lot of work to do on this issue,\u201d said Co-Chairman Curbelo, who, like Stefanik, is a Republican. \n   \nHe\u2019s right, and because climate change legislation will face resistance from the Trump administration, progress will require bipartisanship. Rep. Stefanik has so far kept a low profile when bucking the Republican line, but the time has come for her to speak up for her district and the country on climate change, even if that means speaking against the Trump administration. \n   \n Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox  \n   \nLocal editorials represent the opinion of \n \nThe Post-Star \n \neditorial board, which consists of Publisher Terry Coomes, Editor Ken Tingley, Projects Editor Will Doolittle, Controller/Operations Director Brian Corcoran and citizen representatives Tim Robinson, Dan Gealt and George Nelson.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Environment news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Climate change news","group":"Science"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"EDITORIAL: Stefanik should lead on climate change","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Warren","zipCode":"12801","state":"New York","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Glens Falls","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Post Star","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169665752","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"164"},"name":"Post Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.poststar.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195704744","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T02:45:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/poststar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/17/117bf80f-a3ad-5a0e-a75c-e34a27906e31/58814cb39794a.image.jpg?resize=300%2C200"}],"video":[]}}

Despite being begged to do so, it also failed to send a grader to allow firefighters access to the Hamabuya farm nor to get aerial support to combat the fire. \n \nThis was despite the Letaba Fire Protection Association having a spotter plane and helicopter on standby and a Working on Fire team being on standby. \n \nMopani insisted it could not call for aerial support because it was not a member of the Fire Protection Association, but the chairperson of the Letaba Fire Protection Association, Trevor Phillips, testified the municipality had been asked in vain many times to become a member. \n \nHe said Mopani was entitled to request aerial support if it wished to do so. \n \nJudge Fourie ruled that Mopani had a legal duty to have taken positive measures by calling for aerial support before the fire became uncontrollable. \n \n\u2013 Caxton News Service \n \nRead original story on citizen.co.za","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"\u2018Negligent\u2019 Mopani municipality to pay for timber farm blaze","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Mpumalanga News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"469759898","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Mpumalanga News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News","Wires"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://mpumalanganews.co.za","publisher":"Caxton & CTP Printers and Publishers Ltd."},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195705384","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Letaba Rest Camp \n \nLetaba Rest Camp is situated on the bend of the Letaba River. The camp is midway between the southern and northern boundaries, reports the  Lowvelder . \n \nThe name means \u201criver of sand\u201d. The riverbed is an excellent location for game viewing, particularly elephant. \n \n\n \n2. Orpen Rest Camp \n \nOrpen Rest Camp is situated on the western border of the KNP. It derived its name from the surname of the donor of the land, Eileen Orpen. \n \nIt is an area of scattered trees and wide-open plains populated by the three big cats. You can also look forward to encounters with wild dog. \n \n3. Talamati Bushveld Camp \n \nTalamati Bushveld Camp is situated in a large open valley. Talamati is a Xitsonga word that means \u201clots of water\u201d. \n \nDespite the meaning of the name, the river is actually dry. The clay soil acts as a giant sponge holding a vast reservoir of underground water. The vegetation there is lush all year round and attracts grazers. \n \n4. Sirheni Bushveld Camp \n \nSirheni Bushveld Camp nestles on the edge of the KNP\u2019s northern plains. \n \nThe Mphongolo River flows close by. Sirheni is a Tsonga word that means \u201ccemetery\u201d. There is an elephant graveyard at a site near to the camp. From the camp\u2019s bird hides a wide variety of game and birds can be watched. \n \n\n \n5. Skukuza \n \nSkukuza is a Shangaan word meaning either \u201che who sweeps clean\u201d or \u201che who turns everything upside down\u201d. It is the biggest camp in the park. \n \nSome Krugerholics even call Skukuza the \u201ccapital\u201d of the Republic of Kruger! \n \nIt is close to the Kruger Gate and an excellent springboard to the rest of the Park. \n \n\n \n6. Punda Maria \n \nThe name of the Punda Maria rest camp was given in 1919 by the first ranger to be posted to the area, Captain JJ Coetser. \n \nHe mistakenly named his post Punda Maria in the belief that this was the Swahili name for zebra, the first big game he saw on arrival. \n \nThe correct Swahili name is actually \u201cpunda milia\u201d or striped donkey. When the error was pointed out to him, he chose to retain the name, in honour of his wife, Maria. \n \nDr. Salomon Joubert said that in 1959, the Parks Board changed the name to Punda Miliya. \n \nDr. Van Warmelo, a well-known ethnomologist, said that the name should be spelt Punda Milia and the board accepted that. \n \nIn 1981 Dr. Tol Pienaar did a submission to the board and two acquaintances of Coetzer Hewit Ivy and Astley Maberley said that this is the correct version of how it came about. \n \nThe board accepted the explanation and the name was restored in 1981. \n \n\n \n\u2013  Caxton News Service \n \nRead original story on lowvelder.co.za","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"This is how these six Kruger camps got their names","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Mpumalanga News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"469759898","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Mpumalanga News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News","Wires"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://mpumalanganews.co.za","publisher":"Caxton & CTP Printers and Publishers Ltd."},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195705546","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Issues such as the mistreatment of farm animals and animals used for testing. \n \nIt\u2019s time that fringe groups such as the Center for Consumer Freedom accept the facts: Americans want animals to be treated humanely, regardless of whether they are wild, raised for food, or owned as pets, and the announcement from Ringling Brothers is evidence of that.

We urge other circus and travelling shows to follow Ringling\u2019s lead and put an end to the use of wild animal acts once and for all. \n \nNicole Paquette \n \nWashington, D.C. \n \nThe writer is a vice president of The Humane Society of the United States.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Nicole Paquette: Conditions for circus animals are worse than portrayed","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Providence","zipCode":"02903","state":"Rhode Island","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Providence","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Providence Journal","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169661167","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"3"},"name":"Providence Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.providencejournal.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195706838","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

The 17 year old netminder picked up his first career shutout as Cape Breton blanked the Québec Remparts 4-0.\n\nAfter a choppy start that saw three whistles in the opening forty seconds, the Eagles would control the early part of the play and get the evening's first goal off the stick of Olivier Bourret. The Cape Breton forward spun around in the right faceoff circle and beat Evgeny Kiselev low along the ice. The lead would double on the first power play of the night for either team, when Giovanni Fiore completed a drop pass from Drake Batherson and slammed the puck in from the top of the circle. The Eagles took a 2-0 lead into the dressing room.\n\nPenalty trouble would follow the Eagles from the first to the second period as the home side began the middle stanza short handed. Cape Breton would kill off three straight penalties including a 29 second five on three. But Québec's best chance of the period would actually come on a short handed breakaway when Dmitry Buynitskiy wired the puck over the net.\n\nDrake Batherson of the Eagles was denied on a breakaway of his own, but prior to that Cape Breton would push the lead to 3-0. Fiore skated up the left side of the and as he was falling would drop the puck to Ross MacDougall who would blast it past Kiselev. MacDougall's goal came in his first game against his old team, having been traded by the Remparts to the Eagles earlier this month. Massimo Carozza, acquired by Cape Breton from Québec at the 2015-16 trading deadline, was also playing his first game against his old club.\n\nThe Eagles locked the game down in the third period, limiting the opportunities as the shots were just 9-4 in favour of the home team. In the final three minutes Remparts head coach Philippe Boucher attempted to spark his offense and pulled the netminder for an extra attacker. The move did not succeed as Drake Batherson would fire the puck in off the left wing and hit the empty net for his second point of the night.\n\nJessiman turned aside all 23 shots from the Remparts, becoming the first Cape Breton netminder to record a shutout at Centre 200 since Philippe Trudeau. Kiselev stopped 33 of 36 shots in addition to the empty netter.\n\nCape Breton continues its home stand Friday night against the Acadie-Bathurst Titan, and it will be Country Night at the Nest. Puck drop is at 7 PM. Tickets for the game can be purchased at Centre 200 box office, by calling 902-564-2200 or online at https://tickets.capebreton.ca/Online/default.asp\n\nThree stars: 1.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2550","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Bega","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Bega District News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169771038","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Bega District News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.begadistrictnews.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195712947","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

REUTERS/Edgar Su \n   By Simon Cambers  | MELBOURNE   \nMELBOURNE Jan 29 Serena Williams plans to play fewer tournaments in the future to aid her quest to win more grand slam titles, according to her coach Patrick Mouratoglou. \n  \nThe 35-year-old American won her 23rd grand slam title on Saturday at the Australian Open, breaking the open-era record she held jointly with Germany\u2019s Steffi Graf. \n  \nSerena will now manage her schedule as she chases down the all-time leader Margaret Court, the Australian whose record of 24 grand slam titles straddled the amateur and professional eras. \n  \n\"Mentally she has to stay fresh and mentally excited when the grand slams start, because they are the goal,\" Mouratoglou told a group of reporters after Serena\u2019s 6-4, 6-4 victory over her sister Venus Williams gave her a seventh Australian Open title. \n  \n\"So we have a lighter schedule \u2013 not lighter than last year, which would be difficult (when she played just eight events and did not play after September) - but lighter than the year before (11 events).\" \n  \nAt one stage in 2016, Serena held the world number one ranking based only on seven events over a 52-week period. \n  \nGermany\u2019s Angelique Kerber overtook her when she won the U.S. Open last September but Serena will return to top spot when the rankings are updated on Monday. \n  \nSerena has traditionally played fewer tournaments than most top players, but since she usually reaches the final, she is able to pick and choose. \n  \nFrom the start of 2012 to the end of 2016, Serena won 288 matches, second only to Poland's Agnieska Radwanska, who won 289. \n  \nBut while Radwanska lost 107 matches in that period, Serena lost just 29. \n  \nMouratoglou said Indian Wells, in March, would be Serena's next stop but didn't expect to see her at too many events before the next grand slam, the French Open, which begins on May 29. \n  \n\"We've already done the schedule for the whole year,\" Mouratoglou said. \"It doesn\u2019t mean that the schedule is not going to change, it's meant to adapt to situations. But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n  \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n  \n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n  \n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n  \nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n  \n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n  \n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\" \n  \n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty) \n  Next In Sports News     Cameroon, Burkina Faso leave form book in tatters  \nLIBREVILLE Burkina Faso and Cameroon booked semi-final berths at the African Nations Cup on Saturday as another page was ripped out of the form book when the latest favourites for the tournament were eliminated. \n    Willy takes one game at a time in City's Cup run  \nLONDON Wearing the number 13 jersey for Manchester City could be seen as underlining Willy Caballero\u2019s status as the Premier League side\u2019s reserve goalkeeper. \n    Americans Rodgers and Snedeker share lead at Torrey Pines  \nFormer college standout Patrick Rodgers, seeking his first PGA Tour title, produced bogey-free golf in dazzling sunshine to charge into a two-way tie for the lead after the third round of the Farmers Insurance Open outside San Diego on Saturday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Simon Cambers"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Tennis-Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","countryCode":"GB","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Reuters UK","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587711","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"266"},"name":"Reuters UK","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","Tennis"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://uk.reuters.com/","publisher":"Thomson Reuters"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195714884","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The business is divided between retail, services and workshops \u2013 all aimed at providing holistic approaches to healthy living. Chalifour says one of her passions in life is working with children. \n \n\u201cWhen I look out into the world, there\u2019s a lot of challenges that the future generation faces,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s staring us in the face right now.\u201d \n \nOne of those challenges is the heroin and opioid crisis, which Chalifour has a personal connection with. She said her niece was addicted to heroin, and Chalifour wants to do what she can to prevent others from going down that road, and to help those who are on the road to recovery. \n \n\u201cI began to think, \u2018What makes somebody turn to a drug or any other substance,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a need that you have to fill. But when you are able to realize that everything you need is inside of you, you will never need anything outside.\u201d \n \nChalifour hopes to use techniques like meditation and other methods of spiritual, mental and emotional healing to help people \u201cknow themselves and find inner happiness,\u201d so that they hopefully do not feel as much of a need to turn to outside sources. \n \n\"If we can offer some tools to help them and aid them in the process, I think that is very important,\" she said. \n \nChalifour lives in Dover with her husband and three children, ages 10, 11 and 16. The family moved to the Garrison City from Massachusetts in June 2015. She previously had a holistic center in Wakefield, Massachusetts, but the business lacked a retail space. \n \nShe said she is excited to offer workshops, massages, infrared spa treatments and other services, while being able to sell items at the \u201cOasis Retail Shoppe\u201d that will help customers achieve spiritual wellness at home. Retail items include herbs, essential oils, decorations and products to aid in meditation and wellness at home. \n \nApart from the retail space, Earth Harmony will feature two unique rooms \u2013 one called the Energy, Healing and Clearing room and one the Massage room. Each will feature Himalayan rock salt panels and a canvas mural. \n \nThe space also has an infrared sauna, which Chalifour said is healthier and more comfortable than normal heat saunas. \n \n\u201cIt heats from the inside out, so it does not feel as uncomfortably hot on the outside,\u201d she said. \u201cIt also helps improve circulation and detoxes the body because it focuses inside.\u201d \n \nHeaded upstairs to the meditation and healing space, there is a small altar Chalifour hopes will help clients find peace.

Presented By RAIN WATER HARVESTING Presented By Anjani Vyas B.Tech Civil Engg.  2. What is Rain Water Harvesting ? Rainwater Harvesting is a simple technique of catching and holding rainwater where its falls. Either, we can store it in tanks or we can use it to recharge groundwater depending upon the situation.  3. Why \u2022 To conserve & augment the storage of ground water \u2022 To reduce water table depletion \u2022 To improve the quality of ground water \u2022 To arrest sea water intrusion in coastal areas \u2022 To avoid flood & water stagnation in urban areas  4. How? The concept is simple  Collect  Store and use  Recharge  5. There are two main techniques of rain water harvestings. \u2022 Storage of rainwater on surface for future use. \u2022 Recharge to ground water.  6. Rainwater harvesting today Collection (Catchment) Flat / sloping roofs Leaf and grit filter, First flush device Transportation: Downtake pipes Storage in tanks Recharge into open wells / borewells / percolation pits / trenches  7. Rain Water in India \u2022 Total annual rainfall in India: 400 million hectare-meters (area x height) \u2022 The Highest Average rainfall in India is at GOA which measures 3005mm per annum. \u2022 The Lowest Average rainfall in India is at WEST -RAJASTHAN which measures 313mm per annum.  8. Components of Rainwater Harvesting System: 1. Catchments area/roof 2. Gutters and downspouts 3. Leaf screens and roof washers 4. Storage tanks 5. Conveying 6. Water treatment  9. 1. Catchments area/roof: The surface upon which the rain falls; the roof has to be appropriately sloped preferably towards the direction of storage and recharge. 2. Gutters and downspouts: The transport channels from catchments surface to storage; these have to be designed depending on site, rainfall characteristics and roof characteristics.  10. 3. Leaf screens and roof washers: The systems that remove contaminants and debris; a first rain separator has to be put in place to divert and manage the first 2.5 mm of rain. 4. Storage tanks: Sumps, tanks etc. where collected rain-water is safely stored or recharging the ground water through open wells, bore wells or percolation pits etc.  11. 5. Conveying: The delivery system for the treated rainwater, either by gravity or pump; 6. Water treatment: Filters to remove solids and organic material and equipment, and additives to settle, filter, and disinfect  12. Materials for Rainwater Tanks  Plastic  Plastic Liner  Polyethylene  Metal  13. Screening Methods Location Results Strainers and Leaf Screens Gutters and Leaders Prevent leaves and other debris from Settling Sedimentation Within Tank Settles particulate matter Tank Treatment Techniques  14. Rainwater Harvesting was done compulsory in the Indian states of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu etc.  15. Rainwater Harvesting System at SIEL Chemical Complex  16.

Others may be slightly above strict income bracket limits of federal fuel assistance programs or receive some government help but not enough to get them through the winter. \n \nBoth community action partnerships work together to keep people warm during the cold New Hampshire winters. \n \nThe success of the 11-year-old campaign is largely dependent on local residents who have received assistance from the community action partnerships being willing to share their stories. A common thread among these neighbors and friends is their pride, which stands tall in the face of adversity. \n \nThose who come to community action programs for help vary widely in the life situations that brought them to ask for help. Most only asked for help when there were no other options. \n \nThe stories we highlighted often demonstrate one main point. Many of us are a job loss, death of a spouse or a medical illness away from a life-altering change of financial position. \n \nWe spoke to people who were scraping by when their furnace stopped working and they had no money to replace it. There were people who could not afford to fill their oil tanks, because they were single parents and had to choose their child\u2019s needs over buying oil. \n \nWe talked to a woman who was making a six-figure income when a debilitating medical condition resulted in her not being able to work and a woman who found the Community Action Partnership of Strafford County after putting her children in its Head Start program. When she needed fuel assistance, CAP of Strafford County was there. \n \nEach person who shared their story in the 2016-17 Gift of Warmth talked about their hesitation to ask for help, and then their great surprise and pleasure when they were compassionately treated by community action partnership staff. \n \n\u201cI was embarrassed, because I was raised, and I am raising my kids, that we take care of our problems,\u201d said Crystal Greenwood, who shared her story in this year\u2019s campaign. \u201cWe do and will continue to do that. But if life gets out of hand, please ask for help. The people at RCA are so graceful and they want us to come to them if they can help.\u201d \n \nGift of Warmth would simply not be viable without the generosity of community members willing to donate. And donate they have. Through 11 years, Gift of Warmth has now raised nearly $460,000. Donations are still being accepted. \n \nHow to help \n \nTax-deductible donations can be made by sending a check for any amount to Seacoast Media Group c/o Gift of Warmth, 111 New Hampshire Ave., Portsmouth, NH 03801. Please include which organization the donation is intended for: Rockingham Community Action or Community Action Partnership of Strafford County. \n \nTo apply for fuel assistance, call RCA at 431-2911. People experiencing any significant hardship and financial crisis can also call the number and they will be referred to the appropriate person. The main office is at 4 Cutts St. in Portsmouth. For more information, visit www.snhs.org. \n \nFor CAP of Strafford County, visit www.straffordcap.org or call 435-2500. The Dover office is at 61 Locust St. The Farmington office is at 527 Main St. and its phone number is 460-4313.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Karen Dandurant"},"topics":[],"title":"Community makes Gift of Warmth a success","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195720665","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They're mentally tough as well. They always kept going. \n\n\"It's something that I learned from them a lot, is how to hopefully do the same, which hopefully I've been able to do.\" \n\nWilliams had been reluctant to talk about records in Melbourne to keep the pressure off, but she is now ready to acknowledge her standing as one of the greatest women players of all time, if not the greatest. \n\n\"I definitely think so. I mean, between Martina, myself, Steffi Graf, hands down we are leading that conversation,\" she said. \n\nHer achievement took 19 long years from her Grand Slam debut as a 17-year-old in Melbourne in 1998, and she is not ready to stop just yet. \n\nBut she insists there are no new goals, despite Court's 24 titles being within reach. \n\n\"I never had a number. That's the beauty of it,\" she said. \n\n\"When I started this journey, I just wanted to win a Grand Slam. Then I just wanted to win. Every time I step on the court, I want to win.\" \n\nAnd in an ominous sign that there is still more to come, she added: \"I don't want it to stop. I want to keep it going.\" \n\n- Enjoy the moment - \n\nBeing at the top for so long means Williams now carefully selects her tournaments, and she is set to take a break now until Indian Wells in early March. \n\nShe said she wanted to enjoy winning in Australia, and give it time to sink in. \n\n\"One thing I learned in the past is you have to enjoy it. That's the beauty of winning Australia, you have a few months to relax,\" she said. \n\n\"If you win the French, it's like back-to-back-to-back-to-back. Australia, you have time to enjoy the moment before the next Grand Slam.\" \n\nWilliams also has wedding plans to make after her recent engagement to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who was courtside for her historic victory. \n\nShe revealed that elder sister Venus would be a bridesmaid, but not when the marriage would take place nor where. \n\nBut she said it was special having Ohanian by her side in Melbourne. \n\n\"He's been so supportive in the stands. Although I never really heard him, even though I heard he was very boisterous,\" she said. \n\n\"I'm so focused, I don't hear a lot. I have really selective hearing. It's nice to have that support. It is a wonderful feeling.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Fighting spirit propels Serena to tennis greatness","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia","countryCode":"SG","country":"Singapore"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Yahoo!

This is a big area.\u201d \n \nSplaine wants the City Council to be proactive and address the problem \u201cbefore we get too far behind.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe stuff coming out of the bottom of the Jones Avenue landfill is going somewhere, it\u2019s got to go here because this is where it naturally would flow,\u201d Splaine said as he stood next to the creek. \u201cIn 50 years, 30 years as the sea level rises, it\u2019s going to start eroding even more of the Jones Avenue landfill, and when you look at the Jones Avenue landfill you see on the edges, on the sides, there\u2019s no capping at all.\u201d \n \nSplaine believes one way to address what he sees as a problem at the landfill is building some kind of berm that would start underground and serve as a barrier between the landfill and creek. \n \n\u201cWhen you talk about landfills, landfill caps are stupid technology, but it\u2019s the only technology short of picking it up and moving it,\u201d Splaine said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just dig it all up.\u201d \n \nBut landfill caps, Splaine contends, are essentially delaying the decay of the garbage and incinerator ash that was dumped in the landfill over the years. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s probably not decaying very much,\" he said. \"That is why what\u2019s on the edge is so important to control.\" \n \nSplaine recalls going to the dump as a child and throwing paint cans into the landfill with his father. \n \n\u201cThere were no restrictions,\u201d he said. \n \nSplaine previously opposed the expansion of the recreation uses outside of the 10-acre landfill on what is 50 acres owned by the city, which includes cross country trails where Portsmouth High School athletes sometimes train. But he stressed he now realizes those efforts are going forward. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Splaine said. \u201cI just want us to address the landfill.\u201d \n \nRoger Pittroff, who lives at the end of Jones Avenue, shares Splaine\u2019s concerns and pointed out several old tires that seemed to be buried in the ground outside of the landfill. \n \n\u201cYou\u2019ve got contaminants down here,\" Pittroff said. \"You need to clean it up.\" \n \nBoth men pointed to metal debris at the edge of Sagamore Creek, which they believe is leaching into the creek. That debris is referenced by city consultants Hoyle, Tanner Associates, which recommends the landfill site be cleaned up. But the 2007 report also says the site is \u201csecure, stable and well vegetated.\u201d \n \nDuring a phone interview this week, City Attorney Robert Sullivan and the city's environmental planner Peter Britz, said the city received a groundwater management zone permit from the N.H. Department of Environmental Services for the landfill and annual groundwater tests are done. \n \n\u201cI think things are pretty well controlled there,\u201d Britz said this week. \n \nIn addition to groundwater testing, there are three surface water sampling locations \u201calong the Sagamore Creek,\u201d Britz said. \n \nTests have been done for 1,4-dioxane, a carcinogen, since 2013, Britz said, but there have been no detections. \n \nIncinerator ash that was dumped there from Pease Air Force Base is enclosed in what Britz described as a \u201cbig baggie, essentially a liner under and over the ash.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe rest of the landfill has a clay cap, which is typically of landfills from that time,\u201d Britz said. \n \nSullivan said the landfill operated in two different eras, first as a municipal refuse site in the 1950s and then it received ash \u201cfrom the refuse to energy facility that was located at Pease,\u201d in the 1980s. \n \n\u201cMunicipal refuse was burned at the site and kept there in the 1950s using a so-called tepee, which was a primitive form of incinerator,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIt was a very large corrugated metal burning facility shaped like a tepee.\u201d \n \nTesting for PFCs, which closed the city\u2019s Haven well at Pease International Tradeport, and have become a major concern at the Coakley landfill in North Hampton and Greenland, have not yet been done at the Jones Avenue landfill, Sullivan said. \n \nCity Councilor Josh Denton stressed during an interview that there\u2019s \u201cno need for alarm\u201d about any issues at the landfill. But he too worries about the side of the landfill near Sagamore Creek and thinks more testing, including testing for PFCs, would be appropriate in the future. \n \n\u201cAs a layman, yes, I think it should be done given what\u2019s in there,\u201d Denton said. \n \nNear the end of a recent tour around the landfill, Splaine said the Jones Avenue location was likely chosen for a landfill site because \u201cit was out of the way and Jones Avenue was very loosely developed.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe question is how come we didn\u2019t start using this for recreation back in the 1930s,\u201d Splaine said. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful site.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jeff McMenemyjmcmenemy@seacoastonline.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Environment news","group":"Science"}],"title":"Portsmouth's Jones Avenue landfill raises concerns","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195721087","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

However, in the field of nursing, studies concerning social support behaviors are limited. The aim of this study was to compare nurse work stressors, social support behaviors, and predictors of these variables among nurses in Jordanian teaching and non-teaching hospitals. Design: A convenience sampling technique and a comparative quantitative research design were used in the current study. Two hundred and ninety-one nurses were recruited from five teaching hospitals, and 172 were recruited from eight non-teaching hospitals in Jordan. Methods: The Nursing Stress Scale (NSS) and the Inventory of Social Supportive Behaviors (ISSB) were used to collect data. Results: The studied variables differed across hospitals. In some subscales, as well as in some individual items of the scales, nurse work stressors and social support behaviors differed between teaching and non-teaching hospitals. In teaching hospitals, the work shift was the only predictor of nurses\u2019 work stressors, whereas the work shift and model of nursing care were predictors of social support behaviors. In non-teaching hospitals, the work shift, level of education, and model of nursing care were predictors of nurse work stressors. Predictors of social support behaviors were marital status, model of nursing, and organizational structure. Conclusions: Regardless of the type of hospital, nurse stressors should be assessed and, once identified, managed by providing various social support behaviors. Clinical relevance: By turning a work environment into a healthy workplace, researchers and nurse leaders believe that improvements can be realized in recruitment and patient safety and quality.

However, acquiring these data in mountainous regions requires labor-intensive, often cost-prohibitive field protocols. Here, we report about validated methods to rapidly identify the spatial distribution of tropical forests, and obtain accurate extent estimates using phenology-based procedures that integrate the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat imagery. Firstly, an analysis of temporal profiles of annual time-series MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) was developed to identify the key phenology phase for extraction of tropical evergreen forests in five typical lands cover types. Secondly, identification signatures of tropical evergreen forests were selected and their related thresholds were calculated based on Landsat NDVI, EVI, and LSWI extracted from ground true samples of different land cover types during the key phenology phase. Finally, a map of tropical evergreen forests was created by a pixel-based thresholding. The developed methods were tested in Xishuangbanna, China, and the results show: (1) Integration of Landsat and MODIS images performs well in extracting evergreen forests in tropical complex mountainous regions. The overall accuracy of the resulting map of the case study was 92%; (2) Annual time series of high-temporal-resolution remote sensing images (MODIS) can effectively be used for identification of the key phenology phase (between Julian Date 20 and 120) to extract tropical evergreen forested areas through analysis of NDVI, EVI, and LSWI of different land cover types; (3) NDVI and LSWI are two effective metrics (NDVI ≥ 0.670 and 0.447 ≥ LSWI ≥ 0.222) to depict evergreen forests from other land cover types during the key phenology phase in tropical complex mountainous regions. This method can make full use of the Landsat and MODIS archives as well as their advantages for tropical evergreen forests geospatial inventories, and is simple and easy to use. This method is suggested for use with other similar regions. \n This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

Modifications of the cross-section were made in order to increase strain and improve its distribution in the piezo ceramic layer of a cantilever. The proposed modifications allowed improving the energy conversion coefficient and increasing the power density. The numerical investigation revealed that modifications have a positive influence on strain and its distribution characteristics. Moreover, the electrical characteristics of piezoelectric cantilevers were investigated by employing a numerical model. The analysis of the results revealed that modifications of the cross-section have positively affected the electrical outputs of the cantilevers. The results of the numerical investigation were validated by experimental investigation. Experimental investigation showed that output voltage density was increased by 9.9%, output current density by 6.9% and power density by more than three-times compared with a conventional cantilever. \n This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

E A RE A R :: Common conditions the GPs should know Michael J. LaRouere, M.D, FACS Board-Certified Otolaryngologist Head and Neck Surgeon Ann Arbor, Michigan June 14, 2011  2. ENT Examination NB: The canal may be partly straightened by pulling the pinna backwards and upwards during examination In infants pull the pinna more horizontally backwards as the shape of the ear canal is different Visit: http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=I3sa2W83iuo&NR=1 2  3. Physiology Anterior direction Inferior Posterior Anterio r Consider the malleus as an arrow; pointing in the forward direction The normal tympanic membrane should appear: . pearly grey . have a light reflex . generally concave . With a visible malleus Attic 3  4. Ear Drum-normal Landmarks An  annulus fibrosus or more commonly referred to as the eardrum margin. This is important. Note how smooth and how ever so slightly blurry it is. Um  umbo - the end of the malleus handle and usually marks the centre of the drum Lr  light reflex or Cone of light \u2013is usually seen antero-inferioirly At  Attic also known as pars flaccida. Any perforations here are serious and need referral. 4  5. Examine out to in External: Pinna (shape, colour, position, tenderness, haematoma) Mastoid Internal: The Canal ( skin, spores, foreign bodies, discharge, debris, wax) The Tympanic membrane (look ant, post, superior/ attic and inferior of malleus) . Colour( opaque, white, red, patches & translucency) . Retraction( landmarks behind it more visible) . Perforation ( safe/ unsafe) . Discharge (mucopurulent) Behind the Eardrum . Fluid behind the drum( meniscus, colour, bubbles) . Any red bits( glomus tumour, granulations or blood?, white- cholesteotoma) 5  6. Ear Wax ● Wax is produced in the outer half of the ear canal and migrates outwards along with the canal skin. Inappropriate instrumentation can cause impaction. ● Wax impaction can cause hearing loss, pain, tinnitus, vertigo, or chronic cough but not usually discharge. ● Sudden expansion after getting water in can cause sudden deafness or pain, but needs careful exclusion of other pathology behind it e.g. infection 6  7. Management: Refrain from using cotton buds. If Symptomatic \u2013 use topical meds Different preparations available none superior to other. Sodium bicarbonate drops might be better at disintegrating wax, but can cause dryness of the canal and/ or irritation . Syringing . When to refer to ENT clinic: . Patients known to have a tympanic membrane perforation or previous ear surgery (need microsuction), only hearing ear . Syringing fails . Causes pain or vertigo, . Hearing loss persists after wax removal. 7  8. External Otitis Infection of the external auditory canal. Mediterranean ear/Swimmers ear Commonly unilateral Gradual onset pruritis, pain, hearing loss, and ear discharge which varies in consistency and colour. Can result in a featureless ext aud- canal Risk factors: trauma, water, Immunosuppression, eczema Can be fungal- spores might not always be visible If treatment fails or otitis externa recurs frequently consider sending an ear swab for bacterial and fungal microscopy and culture 8  9. Management Remove or treat any precipitating or aggravating factors A topical ear preparation for 7 days. Options include preparations containing: a. Both a non-aminoglycoside antibiotic + a corticosteroid e.g. flumetasone\u2013clioquinol (Locorten\u2013Vioform®) ear drops. b. Both an aminoglycoside antibiotic and a corticosteroid (contraindicated if the tympanic membrane is perforated). c. Topical preparations containing only an antibiotic (gentamicin ear drops are contraindicated if the tympanic membrane is perforated). d. Antifungal or ? something containing all three Aural toilet: if earwax or obstruct topical medication (may require referral). Provide appropriate self-care advice 9  10. Glue Ear vs. Otitis Media Factors suggestive of a diagnosis of glue ear include: . frequent attacks of otitis media . it is unusual for children to get multiple resolving episodes of otitis media . prolonged signs . otitis media will usually resolve within 6 weeks and certainly within three months Other risk factors: cleft palate ,Down's syndrome, allergy, family history 10  11. Eustachian Tube Dysfunction A severely retracted eardrum. Margins are very clear as is the malleus and it looks very sunken. 11  12. Eustachian Tube dysfunction Chronic blockage of the Eustachian tube is called Eustachian tube dysfunction. The eustachian tube becomes congested and swollen so that it may temporarily close; this prevents air flow behind the ear drum and causes ear pressure, pain or popping just as you experience with altitude change when travelling on an airplane or an elevator. This can occur when the lining of the nose becomes irritated and inflamed, narrowing the Eustachian tube opening or its passageway. Illnesses like the common cold or influenza. Others: pollution, cigarette smoke, allergic rhinitis, obesity Rarely nasal polyps, cleft palate, skull base tumour 12  13. Eustachian Tube Dysfunction . Chronic ETD may reveal retraction pockets or collapsed middle ear disease with erosion of incus/stapedius. Difficulty auto-inflating the ear drum . Generally the fluid clears spontaneously over a period of several weeks . The efficacy of treatments such as nasal decongestants, oral decongestants, antihistamines is unclear . Antibiotics may help prevent infection in cases of severe barotrauma 13  14. ETD & Children Young children (esp 1 to 6 years) at particular risk because of very narrow Eustachian tubes. Also, they may have adenoid enlargement that can block the opening of the Eustachian tube. Eustachian tube in infants and young children runs horizontally, rather than sloping downward from the middle ear. Thus, bottle-feeding should be performed with the infants\u2019 head elevated, in order to reduce the risk of milk entering the middle ear space. The horizontal course of the Eustachian tube also permits easy transfer of bacteria from the nose to the middle ear space. Most children older than 6 years have outgrown this problem and their frequency of ear infections should drop substantially. 14  15. Ear Drum Perforations ● Safe vs Unsafe Perforations ● Safe perforations . may allow infection to enter the middle ear . conductive deafness ● Unsafe perforations . in fact represent a retraction of the tympanic membrane. . essentially a part of the drum becomes sucked inwards and may gradually enlarge. .when the retraction becomes extensive, keratinous debris builds up in the retraction and may become infected and an acquired cholesteatoma develops 15  16. Unsafe perforations are a)In the attic or b)In the posterior region. These are often linear rather than oval c)Or involve the eardrum margin Anything else is generally Safe. i.e. a) In the anterior region or b) In the inferior region c) And not involving the eardrum margin MAKE SURE YOU ALWAYS INSPECT THE ATTIC AREA ON OTOSCOPY! 16  17. Cholesteotoma 17 Aa three dimensional epidermoid structure exhibiting independent growth, replacing middle ear mucosa, resorbing underlying bone, and tending to recur after removal.\" There is usually a persistent or recurrent scanty cream coloured offensive discharge and progressive hearing loss due to ossicular destruction or toxin induced sensory hearing loss. Otoscopy : a pearly white mass usually in the pars tensa +/- discharge and sometimes erosion of the bone. A perforation is usually present, but is not always visible due to overlying keratin. Granulation tissue or polyps may be seen due to chronic inflammation and sometimes retraction pockets are present. A crust adherent to the tympanic membrane is indicative of a cholesteatoma. They can be reviewed after a short course of steroid or ceruminolytic ear drops, but if it is persistent or reveals an underlying abnormality then you should refer","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ENT Practice"},"topics":[],"title":"EAR: Common Conditions the GPs Should Know","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"SlideShare.net","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"562073703","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"665"},"name":"SlideShare.net","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","InformationTechnology"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.slideshare.net"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://image.slidesharecdn.com/michael-170129071219/95/ear-common-conditions-the-gps-should-know-2-638.jpg?cb=1485674021","https://image.slidesharecdn.com/michael-170129071219/95/ear-common-conditions-the-gps-should-know-3-638.jpg?cb=1485674021","https://image.slidesharecdn.com/michael-170129071219/95/ear-common-conditions-the-gps-should-know-4-638.jpg?cb=1485674021","https://image.slidesharecdn.com/michael-170129071219/95/ear-common-conditions-the-gps-should-know-5-638.jpg?cb=1485674021","https://image.slidesharecdn.com/michael-170129071219/95/ear-common-conditions-the-gps-should-know-6-638.jpg?cb=1485674021","https://image.slidesharecdn.com/michael-170129071219/95/ear-common-conditions-the-gps-should-know-7-638.jpg?cb=1485674021","https://image.slidesharecdn.com/michael-170129071219/95/ear-common-conditions-the-gps-should-know-8-638.jpg?cb=1485674021","https://image.slidesharecdn.com/michael-170129071219/95/ear-common-conditions-the-gps-should-know-9-638.jpg?cb=1485674021","https://image.slidesharecdn.com/michael-170129071219/95/ear-common-conditions-the-gps-should-know-10-638.jpg?cb=1485674021","https://image.slidesharecdn.com/michael-170129071219/95/ear-common-conditions-the-gps-should-know-11-638.jpg?cb=1485674021","https://image.slidesharecdn.com/michael-170129071219/95/ear-common-conditions-the-gps-should-know-12-638.jpg?cb=1485674021","https://image.slidesharecdn.com/michael-170129071219/95/ear-common-conditions-the-gps-should-know-13-638.jpg?cb=1485674021","https://image.slidesharecdn.com/michael-170129071219/95/ear-common-conditions-the-gps-should-know-14-638.jpg?cb=1485674021","https://image.slidesharecdn.com/michael-170129071219/95/ear-common-conditions-the-gps-should-know-15-638.jpg?cb=1485674021","https://image.slidesharecdn.com/michael-170129071219/95/ear-common-conditions-the-gps-should-know-16-638.jpg?cb=1485674021","https://image.slidesharecdn.com/michael-170129071219/95/ear-common-conditions-the-gps-should-know-17-638.jpg?cb=1485674021","http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=I3sa2W83iuo&NR=1"],"sequenceId":"695195725148","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:19Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

This is the best and most interesting orientation session I have ever had. I feel its importance more after reaching the US. Especially to know about accommodation, leasing agreement, coins usage; like I didn't know what dime is. I just wanna thank Jennifer for spreading awareness about US culture in India. All the best for everyone who participates in this session. 2 Authentic Journeys Chronicle 2014-2015 www.authenticjourneys.info Participant Feedback Vinodh Subramanian Attended: US Culture Awareness Predeparture Program  3. \u201cThe US culture training was quite helpful for me. In fact I was able to put much of the session into practice here in the US in real time. Starting from a hand shake, food habits, public transport, usage of words, work culture, dress etiquette, meeting etiquettes and lot more. The bonus part is that she still keeps contact with everyone and sends news letters based on the season, climate, functions and festivals here in the US. This gives us enough heads up about the upcoming things/ events in our pipeline. Jennifer is a true helper. I even reached out to her via mail/calls for some of my personal issues/questions and she helped to the best of her ability. The course is a real value-add and I highly recommend it to people who are ready to start their stint in the America.\u201d (Abbreviated) 3 Authentic Journeys Chronicle 2014-2015 www.authenticjourneys.info Participant Feedback Hari Krishnan Attended: US Culture Awareness Predeparture Program  4. The other day, for the first time ever, I spoke on the phone with my cousins who were born and raised in the U.S. I have never spoke to them on the phone before. Even when they used to come to Kerala, I avoided talking with them, because I was too shy and worried we couldn\u2019t understand each other. Your classes have helped me understand how to speak across cultures as well as improve my listening skills. I have been able to improve my working relationships as well as my family relationships.

The \u201cLittle Hats, Big Hearts\" mission is to increase awareness of congenital heart defects, the most common type of birth defect in the country. \n \n\"I\u2019m always very pleased with the types of quality material the American Heart Association puts out for the community,\" said Rebecca McCallister, clinical practice leader at the Exeter Hospital Family Center. \n \nMcCallister said Exeter Hospital does cardiac congenital heart defect testing on newborns. \"That\u2019s the gold standard out there in the country, so hopefully they catch some of those kiddos who do have heart defects before they get very ill,\" she said. \n \nExeter Hospital recently received two large bags of the knitted and crocheted hats. McCallister said the Family Center averages about 60 to 70 births a month and each newborn will receive a hat. \n \n\"We will be passing them out in February and giving the patients education on that,\" she said. \"It\u2019s a great promotion for the community because there\u2019s so much heart disease. The American Heart Association is the go-to campaign.\" While Exeter Hospital does not deliver \"high-risk\" newborns, McCallister said it has delivered newborns with heart defects, where staff was able to stabilize them and send them to another tertiary care center. \n \n\"I think the parents will be really receptive and appreciative of the hats,\" she said. \n \nThis is the second year that Wentworth-Douglass Hospital has participated. \n \n\"We're really excited to do it again this year,\" said Dawn Fernald, spokeswoman for Wentworth-Douglass. \"It brings awareness right from the time the baby is born. When parents are bringing this new baby home, right from the beginning they're keeping this in mind.\" \n \nDana St. Laurent, nurse manager of women and children, said the hospital delivers about 100 babies per month and they too have received their hats. At Wentworth-Douglass, pediatric cardiology is a full-time clinic, which is unique for a community hospital. If a heart defect is detected at birth, cardiology is right on site. \n \nIn addition to the handmade hat, new parents will receive information about congenital heart disease and the AHA\u2019s Support Network for families affected by heart disease and stroke. According to the American Heart Association, congenital heart diseases are structural problems with the heart present at birth. They result when a mishap occurs during heart development soon after conception and often before the mother is aware she is pregnant. Defects range in severity from simple problems, such as holes between chambers of the heart, to very severe malformations, such as complete absence of one or more chambers or valves. \n \nThe American Heart Association put a call out to knitting and crocheting enthusiasts and little red hats came pouring in from all over the state. They will be distributed to babies born at Alice Peck Day Memorial Hospital, Catholic Medical Center, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Exeter Hospital, Lakes Region General Hospital, Littleton Regional Healthcare, Memorial Hospital, Parkland Medical Center, Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, Speare Memorial Hospital and Wentworth-Douglass Hospital. \n \n\u201cThe Little Hats Big Hearts program provides information to parents during one of the most crucial times \u2013 following the birth of their child,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Eddinger, FACC, cardiologist at Catholic Medical Center. \u201cSince congenital heart diseases are the most common type of birth defect in the United States, we want as many parents as possible to be empowered with this information and resources when they leave the hospital.\u201d \n \nFor more about the Little Hats, Big Heart program in New Hampshire, visit www.heart.org/littlehatsbighearts.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Hadley Barndollar hbarndollar@seacoastonline.com"},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Seacoast newborns will sport red hats for American Heart Month","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195726390","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, will reduce the originally proposed $3.6 million to $2 million, and will greatly simplify calculations and applications for aid. Bradley said it can also provide funds to farmers earlier in spring, \u201cassuring that they can feed their herds until the cows can eat grass again.\u201d \n \nThe high cost of cattle feed, coupled with falling federally regulated milk prices, sent 19 state dairy farmers out of the wholesale milk business last year and caused others to sell off many of their cows. Severe drought, especially in southeast New Hampshire, made it impossible for farmers to grow enough of their own feed and sent feed prices soaring. \n \nA stream of supporters, including legislators from the Senate and House, dairy farmers and others, testified at last week\u2019s Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing. Dissent was offered chiefly by representatives of Americans for Prosperity, who said public money should not be used to aid private businesses, and objected that this bill would aid one type of business but give no aid to others also affected by the drought. \n \nIn phone interviews, Seacoast senators, Martha Fuller Clark and Dan Innis, both members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, backed the aid provided by Senate Bill 10. \n \nFuller Clark, D-Portsmouth, who was also on the task force that initially studied the proposed bill and then its amendment, noted that unlike other private businesses, dairy farms cannot raise prices to cover their rising costs. \n \n\u201cThere is no doubt,\u201d she said, \u201cthat dairy farmers need help.\u201d \n \nWhile she believes the bill will be passed by the Senate, she urged dairy farmers to call or write their senators asking them to support it. \n \nInnis, R-New Castle, said he also supports the bill. He did not record a vote in committee, explaining that he was due to testify elsewhere. But had he been present, he said, he would have voted yes. \n \n\u201cOrdinarily, I don\u2019t support subsidies like this but this is something we ought to do,\u201d Innis said. \u201cThis is a special case. It stems from a natural disaster [drought].\u201d \n \nHe also believes the bill has a good chance of passing the Senate. \n \nDairy farmer Harold \u201cHal\u201d Bodmar III of Kensington is among those who have cut back operations. He sold 370 cows last year, leaving just 40 for him to feed this winter. He said he has seen three consecutive years of drought, with 2016 being the worst. Bodmar doesn\u2019t want to close the dairy farm created by his grandfather and also operated by his father, but he is exploring specialty products such as grass-fed beef, and is looking at other sales options. \n \nState Agriculture Commissioner Lorraine Merrill wrote during this summer\u2019s drought: \u201cCows don\u2019t like hot weather, and they respond by eating less and making less milk.\u201d She also reported severe crop losses among forage crops such as alfalfa, grass and corn. Merrill, whose family operates a dairy farm in Stratham, has recused herself from administering the aid. Should the bill pass, the Department of Agriculture would appoint a staff member for the task.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jane Reid"},"topics":[{"name":"Agriculture news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US State Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"}],"title":"NH Senate to take up bill to help dairy farmers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195726561","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Rep. Jackie Cilley, D-Barrington, filed House Bill 499 at the request of a 17-year-old Barrington resident and Dover High School senior, Cassandra Levesque. Not all agree on its merit. \n \nThe state\u2019s current law on marriage is broken into two parts: the age of consent to get married and the marriageable age. The current age of consent is 18 years old; the marriageable age is 13 for females and 14 for males with \u201cpermission\u201d from the state to marry, except for gay marriages. The gay marriage law that went into effect in January 2010 set the minimum age of 18 for same-sex couples with no special exceptions for anyone under 18. \n \nThe state\u2019s age of consent and marriageability has shifted over the years, though the age of consent to a marriage has been at least 16 since 1907, according to copies of the state law provided by Rep. David Bates, R-Windham, who opposes the bill. The current age of consent dates to 1973, which is 18 years for both sexes. From 1923 to 1973, it was 18 for females and 20 years old for men. From 1907 to 1923, it was 16 for females and 18 for males. Before 1907, there was only the age of consent, which was 13 years for females and 14 for males. Before 1891, it was 12 for females and 14 for males. \n \nLevesque, a Girl Scout, became interested in the subject after attending a workshop at the Scout\u2019s annual Senior Leadership Conference about human trafficking and forced child marriage presented by the United Nation Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF). Among its advocacy is eliminating marriage under the age of 18, which it calls \u201ca fundamental violation of human rights.\u201d \n \nUNICEF believes more than 700 million women alive today were married before their 18th birthday and about 250 million were married before the age of 15. UNICEF's central focus is in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, where the highest percentage of under 18 marriages occur, according to its data. \n \nUNICEF USA does not list any U.S. reporting of under 18 marriages on its website, stating there is no data available. However, the Tahirih Justice Center, a nonprofit that assists those trying to flee coercion and violence globally, estimates about 1,500 to 2,900 cases of \"known or suspected\" forced marriages around the U.S., according to a tabulation of a 2011 survey of various agencies around the country.  \n \nAfter the Scout conference, Levesque wanted to know about her home state. \u201cI was shocked and appalled,\u201d she said when she learned of the law. \u201cI wanted to get rid of it and make it more just.\u201d She contacted Cilley, who also said she was surprised at the age of marriageability. \n \n\u201cI was a little shocked that this was the floor of our marriage laws,\u201d she said. \n \nCilley learned that not only was there a law, but it\u2019s been used in modern times. While not common, she said according to the data she\u2019s received from the Secretary of State Division of Vital Records, there has been one instance of a 13-year-old, three cases of 16-year-olds and about 25 cases of 17-year-olds getting married in the state in the past five years. \n \n\u201cThere is no other type of contract that they could enter into legally. None,\u201d Cilley said. Not even getting a library card that's not under a parent or guardian, she said. \u201cAnd yet what many people consider one of our most solemn contracts that entails, literally, 1,168 different privileges, responsibilities and benefits, somebody at the age of 13 can enter into in the state of New Hampshire.\u201d \n \nWhile Cilley and Levesque expressed surprise at the law, Bates did not. \n \n\u201cMost people are shocked to learn that our current, long-standing law permits marriage by minors as young as 13 for females and 14 for males,\u201d Bates said. \u201cHowever, what seems to be missed or ignored is the fact that this provision only applies with the consent of the minor's parent or guardian and only if special cause exists, which needs to be demonstrated to the satisfaction of a judge before they receive permission from the court to conduct the marriage.\u201d \n \nBates sees \u201cspecial cause\u201d mainly as early teenage pregnancy, which he made clear he doesn\u2019t condone, nor does he advocate for early teenage marriage. He believes the reason the age of marriageability remained at 13 and 14 years old was because the state wanted to encourage the mother and father to remain together. \n \n\u201cThere was a time where there was a common belief that a child would be best served by growing up in a home with their natural mother and father,\u201d he said. \n \nBates urges caution on changing a law. If the Legislature is going to change a provision in the law that has been in place for 110 years, he said, it should at least make an effort to be fully informed about its history and the reason why it was enacted. \n \nCilley remains adamant that young teens should not be unable to enter into a marriage contract. \n \n\u201cThis bill simply says we believe as a society that 13, 14, 15, even 16 and 17 is too young to enter into a contract,\u201d she said. \n \nCilley urged action on increasing the age of marriageability to 16 years old this legislative session with an amendment that would create a study committee to look at when special exceptions are made. \u201cThe law is really not clear,\u201d she said. \n \nShe believed the study committee should also look at how the law between heterosexual and homosexual couples can be the same. Both Cilley and Bates agreed the current law includes language that is discriminatory and unconstitutional.  \n \nThe Children and Family Law Committee, which had a hearing on the bill last Tuesday, where Levesque, Cilley and Bates testified, will hold an executive session on the bill Tuesday, Jan. 31 at 10 a.m. in the Legislative Office Building in Concord, Room 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Brian Early bearly@seacoastonline.com"},"topics":[{"name":"US State Government news","group":"Society"}],"title":"NH House bill seeks to ban young teens from marrying","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195726760","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The bill seeks to have the state pay 15 percent of contributions of the retirement system for teachers, police and firefighters. It will now go to the House floor for a vote. \n \nThe state once contributed 35 percent to the retirement system for teachers and first responders, but the Legislature abolished the state\u2019s contribution in 2011, leaving towns and cities to pick up the cost. \n \nThe bill\u2019s main sponsor, Rep. Renny Cushing, D-Hampton, said the legislation is vital for municipalities, who each lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in aid from the state in 2011. Hampton received between $600,000 and $700,000 for teachers\u2019 and first responders\u2019 retirement each year from the state before aid was cut in 2011. Portsmouth received more than $1 million a year from the state in retirement contributions for teachers, police and fire. \n \nThe state began paying 35 percent of the retirement system cost for police, firefighters and teachers in 1977 when the Legislature and governor passed that fixed percentage into law. In 2009, the state lowered its commitment to 30 percent. Rep. Jackie Cilley, D-Barrington, was a state senator in 2009 and recalled Gov. John Lynch stating the decrease in contribution was meant to be temporary, as the state was struggling through the recession at the time. Cilley said the Legislature underwent massive turnover in 2010 and Republicans wiped out the state\u2019s contribution to the system the next year. \n \nCushing, along with other proponents of bringing back the state contribution, have said the state made a \u201cpromise\u201d in 1977 to contribute to the system and lawmakers went back on that promise six years ago. \n \n\u201cThe state had a role in supporting public education and public safety,\u201d Cushing said. \u201cIt made a promise to communities it would partner and support retirement costs for teachers\u2026 police and fire.\u201d \n \nCushing said he proposed the state contribute 15 percent because he believes that would be more likely to pass than a request for the state to return to 35 percent. A cost analysis provided by the New Hampshire Retirement System states the bill would have the state contribution increase by $40.81 million in fiscal year 2018, and that number would increase slightly in the following three years. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a claw back in its attempt to hold the state accountable,\u201d Cushing said. \n \nOne of the committee members who voted against recommending the bill, Rep. Steven Beaudoin, R-Rochester, said he understood local taxpayers would benefit from the state contributing to the system. However, he believes the state should not be funding pensions for any town or city employees and questioned whether tax dollars raised from small towns should be used to pay for employee pensions in larger cities. \n \nBeaudoin also was concerned about where the money would come from, saying adding $40 million per year to the state\u2019s expenses is a \u201ctough nut to crack.\u201d \n \nCushing said no funds specifically have been identified to pay for the contribution, but he believes it should be the state\u2019s responsibility to pay that cost based on the Legislature\u2019s intent in 1977 to help fund pensions. \n \nCilley said the state demonstrated how much it valued reserving state dollars for the retirement system when it amended the state Constitution in 1984 to require money in the system solely be used for that purpose. At the time, she said, there was interest in raiding the funds for other uses. \n \n\u201cIf they want to do any one thing that will help the property taxpayers in this state, it\u2019s to go back to the promise they made to pay their contribution,\u201d Cilley said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Max Sullivan msullivan@seacoastonline.com"},"topics":[{"name":"US State Government news","group":"Society"}],"title":"State retirement contribution bill heads to NH House","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195726949","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Notable efforts to build the exit occurred between 1994 and 2003. \n \nReading through the archives of this newspaper, one finds great enthusiasm for the project rising like a king tide only to be dashed against the rocks by unattainable easements, lack of consensus and funding cuts. \n \nIn 2003, Exit 10 appeared on the state\u2019s 10-year Highway Plan (TYP) with funding in 2014, but it was later dropped from the plan as funding grew scarce during economic hard times. \n \nState Sen. David Watters, a Democrat, who represents District 4 which includes Barrington, Rollinsford, Somersworth and Dover, has fought for funding to rebuild roads and bridges and ensured the 10-Year Highway Plan supported Route 108 upgrades, Little Bay Bridges project and planning for Exit 10. \n \nExit 10 was put back on the TYP in 2014 but without any funding and in 2015 funding for a feasibility study was secured and it is currently slated for five years from now. \n \nRegional planners agree the same reasons to support the road still exist, such as improving safety, easing traffic and reducing the environmental impact of the traffic. The key difference this time is the significant development along the Route 108 corridor and the potential for more has drawn hundreds of businesses with a vested interest. \n \nSomersworth Director of Planning and Community Development Shanna Saunders is fairly new to the job and the region. She said while she doesn\u2019t have the history she has no trouble seeing the value Exit 10 would provide. \n \n\u201cThe city is very much in favor of it,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cIt would be good for business retention and good for business development.\u201d \n \nAccording to Saunders, the Route 108 corridor also known as the Medical Mile continues to be an important economic driver. \n \nThe state's 10-year Highway Plan includes a $12 million complete streets project for the Route 108 corridor. The engineering is to begin this year and construction is slated for 2023-24. The complete streets concept looks to incorporate pedestrian and bicycle access into road projects. \n \nWhile the improvements would ease some of the traffic and help the corridor remain attractive, the Exit 10 access road would make getting to the turnpike much faster. \n \nRochester Economic Development Manager Karen Pollard said the Rochester Economic Development Commission is firm in its support of Exit 10 from an economic development and community development perspective. \n \n\u201cThe development of Exit 10 makes the southern tier of Rochester more accessible from the Spaulding Turnpike and would be very beneficial to the businesses located in the Granite State Business Park,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cMany of these businesses like Albany International and Safran have testified to the fact that Exit 10 helps both their shipments in and out but also improves travel for their employees. \n \nPollard said the development of Exit 10 would distribute the traffic at relevant intervals. \n \n\u201cWhen the NHDOT improved exits 11 through 15, Rochester saw immediate economic impact in new private investment and commercial activity that is ongoing,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cMost impressive at exits 14 and 15, we have many new businesses that have located near the exits to take advantage of the new ramps and wider streets surrounding the NHDOT improvements.\u201d \n \nIn Dover, however, there has never been much support and the lack of enthusiasm still exists. Dover Economic Development Director Dan Barufaldi said the Garrison City doesn\u2019t need another exit. \n \n\u201cI can see the need in Rochester and Somersworth and why those communities are behind it,\u201d Barufaldi said. \u201cFrankly, I think Exit 9 is ripe for a lot more commercial development, so to poke another road through doesn\u2019t make sense. We think that continuing to improve 108 would still be a better course of action and investment.\u201d \n \nBarufaldi acknowledged traffic is heavy on Route 108 and said that is unlikely to change because there are people who will go that way to Rochester to avoid the toll and others who want to stop along the way to and from work at a coffee shop or similar business. \n \nThe Strafford Regional Planning Commission (SRPC) is one of several regional planning commissions around the state that help member communities make informed decisions by providing technical studies, data analysis, collection and interpretation. \n \nSince the 2000 census, Strafford County has the fastest growing population in New Hampshire and in recent years has seen significant economic development in the Tri-City region, according to SRPC. \n \nTo facilitate ongoing economic growth, while promoting a high standard of life in the region, it is essential to provide additional access to the Spaulding Turnpike in the vicinity of the Somersworth/Rochester city limits. \n \nStatistics provided by SRPC show the number of accidents along the corridor have increased by as much as 129 percent. \n \nSomersworth Mayor Dana Hilliard said Exit 10 has always been and continues to be a foundation to move Somersworth\u2019s economic vitality forward. \n \n\u201cThis project has been studied, debated, and in some cases, promised to our community since my youth,\" Hilliard said. \"Somersworth has been overly patient about this project moving forward. The time for approval of Exit 10 is overdue. It is now time for it to become a reality.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Judi Currie jcurrie@seacoastonline.com"},"topics":[],"title":"Elusive Exit 10 plan for Spaulding Turnpike back again","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195727155","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:13Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Most of the fee would be deposited in an already existing state fund for domestic violence programs.  \n \nThe Office of Secretary of State estimated 300 special licenses would be issued per year, resulting in $24,000 in revenue for funding domestic violence programs. \n \nThe House Judiciary Committee voted \u200b13 to 5 to recommending that the bill be defeated.

Included are rules of process authorizing meeting notice requirements, quorums, and the methods of making and voting on motions of recommendation on individual bills heard at public hearings. \n \nRep. Timothy Smith, D-Manchester, offered a change to the rule that would encourage committees to allow citizens to speak before paid lobbyists at public hearings. The rule he wrote was \"to ensure on a best-effort basis that members of the public are recognized to testify at public hearings before individuals properly identified as lobbyists.\" \n \nHe pointed out that because of busy schedules, time may run out at public hearings before everyone wishing to speak can do so, and those not recognized to testify early may not be heard at all. Citizens who take a day off work to testify may not be heard. But a long-time committee chair opposed the new rule, saying the rule change could limit the committee from asking lobbyists to speak who may have important information to share. \n \nBefore the vote on the suggested new rule change, two legislators, one for passage and one against, were allowed to ask \"parliamentary questions,\" suggesting how legislators should vote. Those questions, a tradition in the legislature, often best sum up the issue just before a vote is taken. Those asking the question thereby recommend pressing the \"Green\" button on each legislator's' seat, which electronically is a vote for a motion, or the \"Red\" button, which casts a vote against the motion.  \n \nRep. Frost, supporting the rule change, asked \"If I know that this is the 'peoples' house' and not the 'lobbyists' house' would I now push the green button?\"  \n \nRep.

Page 3 of 6 News Qatar  Qatar's trade surplus reaches QR10.75bn in December \u2013 A surge in value of crude exports, ahead of the January 1 deadline for production cuts, helped Qatar's trade surplus reach QR10.75bn in December 2016, showing a stupendous growth of 21.7% YoY and 10.7% MoM. Japan, South Korea, India, China and Singapore were among the largest export markets of Qatar, while imports mainly came from the US, the UAE, China, Japan and Germany in December 2016, figures released by the Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics showed. Higher exports and lower imports had resulted in Qatar's MoM gain in trade surplus, while on a yearly basis, imports decelerated much faster than exports. A robust expansion in shipments to Singapore and China led the country\u2019s total exports (valued free-on-board) grow 2.6% MoM to QR19.29bn. On a yearly basis, total exports had fallen 2.6%. The country\u2019s total exports of domestic products increased 3.5% MoM to QR18.58bn in December 2016, while it recorded 3% YoY decline. (Gulf-Times.com)  CI affirms Qatar\u2019s foreign, local currency ratings, upgrades outlook to \u2018stable\u2019 from \u2018negative\u2019 \u2013 Global credit rating agency Capital Intelligence (CI) has affirmed Qatar\u2019s long-term foreign currency and local currency ratings of \u2018AA-\u2019 and its short-term foreign and local currency ratings of \u2018A1+\u2019, while upgrading the outlook for ratings to \u2018stable\u2019 from \u2018negative\u2019. The outlook revision reflects the resilience of the Qatari economy to low hydrocarbon prices, as seen by the continuation of positive economic growth and maintenance of comfortable fiscal and external buffers, CI said, adding the revision also factored in its expectation of narrowing fiscal and external current account deficits in 2017-18. The Qatari economy is expected to have grown by about 3.4% in 2016 against 3.3% a year ago, underpinned by a 6% expansion in non-hydrocarbon gross domestic product (GDP) and is slated to grow at a similar rate in 2017-18. The public finances remain \u201cmanageable\u201d, despite budget \u201cdeterioration\u201d, it said, adding the budget is expected to have posted a deficit of 2.7% in 2016 against 1.2% surplus in 2015. Assuming a modest rise in hydrocarbon prices in the short-to-intermediate term and government measures to rationalise public spending, CI expects the deficit to decline over the coming years. (Gulf-Times.com)  Private healthcare spending to grow at a faster pace \u2013 According to BMI, a Fitch company, Qatar\u2019s private healthcare expenditure is expected to grow at 8.8% in the next 10 years, faster than the 5.8% in public healthcare, offering abundant opportunities especially for global drug manufacturers. Highlighting that the healthcare expenditure in Qatar is slated to grow steadily from QR15.4bn in 2016 to QR27.1bn in 2026, it said, this is a moderate 10-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 5.8% in local currency and US dollar terms. Qatar\u2019s public expenditure was about 84% of overall health expenditure in 2016 but as healthcare costs increase rapidly on an ageing population and a rising chronic disease burden, the model of almost-free medical services will be increasingly seen as \u201cunsustainable\u201d, and the private sector is being engaged to share some of the financial burden, it said. (Gulf-Times.com)  Qatar economic growth to pick up in 2017 \u2013 According to Qatar Investment Fund (QIF) report, the recovery in oil price and a strong expansion in non-hydrocarbons should help Qatar effectively manage the future interest rate hikes, helping the country's economic growth to pick up in 2017. London Stock Exchange-listed QIF in its report for 4Q2016 said, \"The investment adviser expects Qatari economic growth to pick up in 2017, amid the recovery in oil prices and a strong growth in the non-hydrocarbon sector.\u201d Its investment adviser is Qatar Insurance Company. This should help the economy to face the rate hike over the course of the year, whose top 10 Qatari portfolios include QNB Group (19.4% of its net asset value), Industries Qatar (11.7%), Masraf Al Rayan (9.2%), Qatar Electricity and Water (7.9%), Qatar Islamic Bank (7.4%), Nakilat (6.4%), Ooredoo (5.9%), Barwa (4.9%), Gulf International Services (3.8%) and Commercial Bank (3.6%). (Gulf-Times.com)  QIF's exposure to UAE market rises in 4Q2016 \u2013 Qatar Investment Fund\u2019s (QIF) exposure to the UAE market has grown up. The exposure of the Fund in the market has reached 6.8% of net asset value (NAV) by the end of 4Q2016. It was 4.3% in 3Q2016, latest data released by the UK-based closed- ended investment company showed. According to the QIF\u2019s fourth quarterly investment report, the Fund had 23 holdings, 16 in Qatar and seven in the UAE, while in 3Q2016 it had 22 (17 in Qatar and five in UAE) at the end of 3Q2016. The report revealed that QIF added three holdings during the quarter, which included Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIK), Air Arabia and First Gulf Bank, while the Fund sold its holdings in Vodafone Qatar and Qatar First Bank. Providing sector wise investment exposure, the report said that QIF remains overweight in the Qatar banking sector (including financial services) at 42.4% of NAV (market weighting 38.4%). QNB group remains QIF\u2019s largest holding accounting for 19.4% of NAV. For the period from January to December 2016, credit in Qatar grew 12.1%, mainly driven by the public sector (up 25.7%). The Investment Adviser believes that public sector loan growth will remain strong, driven by the government\u2019s infrastructure development plans and a rising population. Industrials remain QIF\u2019s second largest exposure at 25.8% of NAV, mainly in Industries Qatar (11.7% of NAV). (Peninsula Qatar)  QNBK: IMF tinkers with growth forecasts, but is still too optimistic \u2013 QNB group said that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has kept its forecasts for global growth in 2017 unchanged at 3.4% in the latest update of its World Economic Outlook. QNBK said the overall number \u201cmasked some tinkering\u201d with the composition of global growth since the IMF\u2019s last round of forecasts made in October 2016. The projection for growth in advanced economies (AEs) was revised up by 0.1 percentage points (pps) to 1.9%, while growth for emerging markets (EMs) was revised down by 0.1 pps to 4.5%. QNBK said, \u201cHowever, we view the forecasts as over-optimistic and expect them to be revised down in the future, particularly given the IMF\u2019s track record in recent years of consistent downward revisions to global growth projections.\u201d (Gulf- Times.com)  4.

(Gulf- Times.com) International  US economy slows on wider trade gap; business spending rises \u2013 US economic growth slowed sharply in 4Q2016 as a fall in shipments of soybeans weighed on exports, but steady consumer spending and rising business investment pointed to sustained strength in domestic demand. Gross domestic product increased at a 1.9% annual rate, the Commerce Department said in its first estimate of 4Q2016 GDP. The economy grew at a 3.5% annual rate in 3Q2016. The slowdown masked a surge in home building spending and a rebound in business investment on equipment after four straight quarterly declines. The economy expanded 1.6% for all of 2016, the worst performance since 2011, as it struggled with weak oil prices, a strong dollar and efforts by businesses to reduce a large inventory overhang. (Reuters)  UK consumers turn more confident after December dip \u2013 British consumer confidence showed its biggest monthly improvement since last summer in January, a latest sign that the Brexit vote has yet to unsettle the households who are driving Britain's economy. After falling in December, the YouGov/Cebr Consumer Confidence Index rose 2 points to 110.3 in January, its biggest increase since August and its highest level since September. The improvement reflected a better outlook for house prices, businesses and household finances, YouGov and Cebr said. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has said he will keep a close eye on how Britons spend their money in 2017, given the economy's reliance on consumers. Their spending power is expected to be hurt by rising prices caused by the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote. (Reuters)  Eurozone corporate lending accelerates in December \u2013 The European Central Bank said bank loans to Eurozone companies grew at the fastest pace in 4- 1/2 years in December and a key measure of money circulating, often an indicator of future activity, rose more than expected. Corporate lending grew by 2.3% in December after a revised 2.1% increase one month earlier, the data showed. Household lending growth in the 19- member currency bloc accelerated to 2.0% from 1.9% in November, the biggest gain since mid-2011. The annual growth rate of the M3 measure of money circulating in the Eurozone, which has in the past often predicted economic activity, rose 5.0% in December from 4.8% in November, slightly beating forecasts for 4.9%. (Reuters)  Japan December core consumer prices fall at slowest pace in nearly a year \u2013 Japan's core consumer prices fell at the slowest annual pace in nearly a year in December, a sign that inflation should pick up in coming months on a rebound in oil costs and rising import costs from a weak yen. The data will be among factors the Bank of Japan will scrutinize at a policy meeting early next week, where it is widely expected to keep monetary policy steady and maintain its upbeat inflation projections. Core consumer prices, which include oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, slipped 0.2% in December from a year earlier, government data showed, roughly in line with a median market forecast for a 0.3% fall. (Reuters) Regional  Projects spending in 2017 are likely to grow in GCC\u2013 According to Ed James, Director of Content and Analysis at MEED Projects, the best case scenario for projects spending in the GCC in 2017 is $151bn, whilst the worst case is $112bn. He said, \u201cOur analysis suggests that Saudi Arabia and the UAE will be the largest markets in the region in 2017 for projects. With all countries in the GCC, bar Kuwait, experiencing a budget deficit in 2017, we will start to see greater diversification of revenue, including more initial public offerings (IPOs) and borrowing, and a decrease of spending commitments in non-project areas, such as reducing exposure to tariffs and subsidies, employee perks and bonuses.\u201d (GulfBase.com)  Saudi Arabia banks likely to outperform GCC counterparts \u2013 Despite challenges, with a return on assets of 1.9% as of year- end 2016 versus 2% in 2015, Saudi Arabia banks\u2019 profitability are expected to continue to outperform other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) banking systems. In 2016, Saudi Arabia banks reported a 5.4% YoY decrease in net profits, mainly because of rising provisioning charges, a credit negative. The provisioning increase reflects asset quality challenges amid low oil prices. Keeping in view the 2016 results, Moody\u2019s expect that Saudi Arabia banks\u2019 profits will remain challenged in 2017 amid an increasing cost of risk and subdued credit growth that, despite easing funding costs, will negatively affect top-line revenues. (Bloomberg)  OPEC cuts will not impact Saudi Arabia oil supply to Japan \u2013 Crude supplies to Japan from its biggest supplier Saudi Arabia will not be impacted by 2016 agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC countries to cut output. Saudi Arabia is the number one crude oil supplier to Japan, with its oil accounting for 1.13mn barrels per day, or 33.5% of its total imports in 2015.

Page 5 of 6  S&P GR downgrades Sharjah to 'BBB+/A-2'; keeping outlook Stable \u2013 S&P Global Ratings lowered its long- and short-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings on the Emirate of Sharjah to 'BBB+/A-2' from 'A/A-1'. The outlook is stable. The downgrade reflects an accumulation of government debt above our expectations for 2016 and our revised assumption of elevated fiscal expenditure over 2017-2020, leading to a slower fiscal consolidation path. Sharjah's debt as a percentage of GDP has rapidly increased since 2014, due to persistent fiscal deficits and increased capital spending. Although S&P project the Emirate's economy will gradually recover in 2017-2020, fiscal consolidation will be slower than they initially anticipated. S&P said they expect interest expenditures to stay above 5% of revenues over this period, despite the likely introduction of revenue-raising measures. Sharjah's fiscal underperformance below their expectations has resulted in a rapid increase in the Emirate's debt burden. (Bloomberg)  S&P GR affirms Ras Al Khaimah at 'A/A-1'; keeping outlook Stable \u2013 S&P Global Ratings affirmed its 'A/A-1' long- and short-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings on the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah (RAK). The outlook remains stable. RAK's economic structure is relatively diverse when compared with that of other countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The manufacturing sector contributes about 25% of GDP, real estate and business services 9%, and wholesale and retail trade 12%. The oil and gas sector represents only 4.8% of GDP. Tourism, a rapidly growing sector, is regarded as one of RAK's economic priorities and its direct contribution is approaching 3% of GDP. However, four sectors- stone, mica, glass, and ceramics--contribute nearly 85% of exports and are largely active in regional construction.

Although it did not look like it on the night, it was only Colorado\u2019s second conference win all season, and in the process they ended a 17-game winning streak for Oregon. \n \nThe Coors Events Center continued to be a house of horrors for the Ducks, as this loss marked their seventh consecutive in \u201cThe Keg.\u201d The win finally gave Buff fans a taste of what could have been or maybe even what could be. \n \n\u201cI think that\u2019s the Colorado Basketball team we all know and love,\u201d head coach Tad Boyle said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more proud of a group of guys. As a head coach, I\u2019ve never been through something like this, with a team like this. Those guys in that locker room, the joy and happiness after the four tough losses we\u2019ve endured, they handled the line-up shift the other night like men, I was really proud of them for that, and tonight we flipped it back and everybody responded.\u201d \n \nOn Derrick White night, with fans wearing white shirts throughout the crowd, the fifth-year senior led the Buffs upset with  23 points, five rebounds and four assists, but his presence was felt in more than just the box score. \n \n\u201cA lot of stuff that he did that was great doesn\u2019t show up on the stat sheet,\u201d George King explained. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if we could have won that game without him tonight.\u201d \n \nKing complimented White\u2019s performance literally and figuratively, adding 13 points and eight rebounds of his own. All in all, the Buffs came out with a sense of urgency that has not been seen in a long time. \n \n\u201cI think they just maybe got to the point where enough is enough,\u201d Boyle told the media. \u201cWe haven\u2019t played with that kind of passion, energy, and effort on defense for 40 minutes all year so hopefully we can build from this.\u201d \n \nFor 38 minutes and 15 seconds on Saturday, the Colorado Buffaloes held the lead over the 10th ranked team in the nation. The Buffs controlled the game on the defensive end, holding the Ducks nearly 15 points under their season average as well as on the offensive end, becoming just the third school this season to score over 70 points on their defense. \n \n\u201cThey beat us. They out rebounded us, outfought us and made more plays than we did,\u201d expressed Oregon head coach Dana Altman. \n \nColorado now finds themselves with two consecutive wins on their hands, finally feeling like they are reaching the potential so many thought they had. While Saturday night\u2019s win was a great moment for a team that struggled all year, everyone in black and gold is hoping it will lead to something more. \n \n\u201cThe joy and togetherness in that locker room is something we can build on, it\u2019s not going to be easy,\u201d Boyle concluded. \u201cWe\u2019re halfway through the conference season, the first nine games are in the rearview mirror\u2026 I just want these guys dialed in, if they dial in we can play with anyone in this league and there is a lot of basketball left to be played.\u201d \n \nThe Buffs will have their chance to prove that this game was more than just a fluke when they head to Palo Alto to take on the Stanford Cardinal on Thursday.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: college basketball news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"White Night: Derrick White ponies up 23 as Buffs upset Ducks","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Yard Barker","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"459817831","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Yard Barker","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.yardbarker.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195733352","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:55:13Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2350","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Armidale","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Armidale Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"346766083","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"The Armidale Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.armidaleexpress.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195733618","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

He alleged that the Liberals wanted to wrest police from Mr Grant, a senior Nationals MP.\n\n\"The Nationals wanted police, the right wing faction of the Liberals wanted police,\" he said. \"So she split it in two.\"\n\n\"It's the police who keep us safe from terrorism,\" Mr Foley said.\n\n\"The police commissioner now has to report to two people. It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Smith is mistrustful of what she calls the mainstream media, particularly those elements she believes are biased towards the left. As Kirralie Smith sits at a sidewalk table in Taree for an interview this week, there is a palpable tension. She is mistrustful of what she calls the mainstream media, particularly those elements she believes are biased towards the left. But Smith has agreed to talk because she will, she says, use any platform to express her view that Islam is an ideology of violence, intolerance and sexism.\n\nSmith received relatively little attention during the last federal election as a NSW Senate candidate for the Australian Liberty Alliance, the political offshoot of the Q Society, which describes itself as \"Australia's leading Islam-critical movement\".\n\n(\"Q Society supports an integrated multi-ethnic Australia and rejects racism, which the Oxford dictionary defines as: 'Belief in the superiority of a particular race.' Since Islam is not a race or ethnicity, being critical of Islam is not racist,\" its website explains.)\n\nBut she is likely to receive far more press in the coming weeks as the co-defendant in a defamation action being brought by the businessman Mohammed El-Mouelhy, who was the subject of a critical video produced by the Q Society and presented by Smith.\n\nAlready Smith and the Q Society, also named in the suit, have rallied an impressive line-up of public supporters, including Coalition right-wingers Cory Bernardi, George Christensen and the former MP Ross Cameron, who are among a handful of public figures set to address fundraisers to be held in Sydney and Melbourne on February 9 and 10.\n\nWe sit and both reach for our phones to turn on recording apps. Smith has already explained that she wants her own record of our conversation. The tension dissipates \u2013 a little \u2013 when a sky-blue ute throbs past us and Smith laughs and points out the personalised number plate, \"TRUMP1\". Later she will tell me that she rejects the suggestion she is right wing, rather, she says she a part of the silent majority of mainstream conservatives whose voices are now being heard due to victories of Donald Trump and the Brexit campaign.\n\nSmith says she never intended to pursue politics. She has always been happiest as a wife and mother. \"I love being my husband's wife,\" she says to emphasise the point.\n\nAs it was, a confluence of events brought her to her mission. In 2000 Smith and her husband Greg, a tradesman, sought out volunteer work in Mali and there met the Assemblies of God missionary Faouzi Arzouni, whom she describes as a Muslim apostate who became a friend and mentor.\n\nTwo years later the couple went on another trip, a 10-day visit to refugee camps of the displaced of what is now known as the Maluku sectarian conflict in Indonesia, during which Christian and Muslim communities fell into violent political and ethnic conflict. Smith recalls sitting in refugee camps hearing terrible stories of violence perpetrated by Muslims.\n\nIn 2009 Smith's husband took her to a talk being given by the Q Society's Mark Durie, an Anglican vicar. During that lecture Durie said that his wife would not buy certain supermarket products because they had been certified as halal.\n\nSmith was intrigued and began her own investigations on the internet, learning that many brands are halal-certified, and that a portion of the fees paid for such certification is donated to Muslim charities. In other countries, Smith contends, those charities have directed funds towards groups with terrorist links. Her online investigation became a website, Halal Choices, a campaign and, with the support of Bernardi and Christensen, a parliamentary inquiry into \"third party\" food certification. Finally it became a political ambit, with Smith running for the ALA in a campaign launched by the anti-Islamic immigration Dutch MP Geert Wilders.\n\n\"There is no question of our country being Islamified. Now, this reply constituted a historical error as soon as it was uttered,\" Wilders once told Dutch parliament.\n\n\"I can report that they have had enough of burkas, headscarves, the ritual slaughter of animals, so\u2011called honour revenge, blaring minarets, female circumcision, hymen restoration operations, abuse of homosexuals, Turkish and Arabic on the buses and trains as well as on town hall leaflets, halal meat at grocery shops and department stores, Sharia exams, the Finance Minister's Sharia mortgages, and the enormous over-representation of Muslims in the area of crime, including Moroccan street terrorists,\" Wilders said.\n\nSmith says she does not believe there is an imminent threat of adopting Sharia law, but is concerned about what she calls \"creeping sharia\".\n\n\"We are being encouraged very strongly to tolerate sharia finance, halal certification, the hijab,\" she says.\n\n\"Sharia is definitely present in Australia \u2026 I believe there are honour killings and it is all reported under domestic violence or another name,\" she says. As evidence she says she has close friends who are pastors who work in churches who have provided sanctuary to victims.\n\nBut Smith's concerns are broader than creeping sharia. During the US election she was horrified by Hillary Clinton's support for abortion rights. She opposes political correctness, Safe Schools and big government regulations imposed upon farmers by distant bureaucrats.\n\n\"I pretty much oppose everything the Greens stand for,\" she says.\n\nShe was also appalled by the Liberal Party's abandonment of Tony Abbott for Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nThis broader political outlook, and Smith's articulate direct manner, has led some observers to speculate that she is a potential leader for a new conservative movement, one energised by the international populist surge.\n\nShe is, says John Adams, a former Coalition adviser who has written about the need for more intellectual depth in the new conservative movement, a more capable and charismatic messenger than, say, Pauline Hanson. (\"I think Pauline has a lot of good sentiment, I am not sure about the ability,\" says Smith of Hanson.)\n\nIn the months since the campaign Smith has kept in touch with supporters via videos on her Facebook page. In them she is relentlessly bright and articulate, upbeat about Christmas and Australia Day, though scandalised by the recent billboard that showed a pair of little girls celebrating in a hijab and cheerily opposed to the \"threat\" of multiculturalism. She denies ever having had media training, though confesses that she is constantly asked if she has.\n\nAsked if she plans to run for office again Smith says she cannot answer the question as her entire focus is directed towards the defamation action and her family.\n\n\"People say this is sexist, well I am sexist, I love being a wife and mother, that is the best I have ever done in my life\u2026 I love being my husband's wife.\"\n\nIn the next breath she adds that she and her husband have made the decision to use any platform to put forward their message.\n\n\"I want to be able to look my children in the eye and say I did everything I could to stand for what is right.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Nick O&#39;Malley"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Religion news","group":"Society"}],"title":"Islam-critical Kirralie Smith seen as potential libertarian leader","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2350","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Armidale","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"The Armidale Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"346766083","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"The Armidale Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.armidaleexpress.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195735867","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:50:27Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/157221b2-f74a-469e-b91c-c9863ca767f7.jpg/r3_0_725_408_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

In an announcement about the move, Dan Powers, president of the Sig Sauer ammunition division, said Arkansas offered \"exceptional economic incentives\" and company officials later said electricity costs in Arkansas are half that of New Hampshire's, with Sig's savings exceeding $1 million a year. \n \nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Sig's cited electric rates are right on the money. \n \nThe federal agency reports residential electric rates for consumers in New Hampshire were 18.93 cents per kilowatt hour in October 2016, compared to 9.85 cents per kilowatt hour in Arkansas. Commercial electric rates for the same month were 14.57 cents a kilowatt hour in New Hampshire and 8.09 cents in Arkansas. \n \nSpeaking for BIA members, Flynn said high electricity costs are due to supply limitations and additional transmission costs. He said he's heard from members, who he declined to identify, that are contemplating leaving the state, or if they're planning expansions, launching those out-of-state, because of the electric rates. In addition to a statewide workforce shortage, Flynn said, the cost of electricity is a top concern for the state's business community.  \n \n\"Electric bills are high,\" said Jim Teetzel, owner of Wilcox Industries, another Newington gun maker, but he calls it \"the cost of doing business.\"  \n \n\"When I hear a company is moving a plant solely because of energy, it just doesn't make sense,\" he said. \"We spend over $50,000 a month on electricity because we have a lot of machinery. That's just not a factor we consider and we probably chew up more electricity than anyone in the area. Would I like lower bills? Of course. Who wouldn't.\"  \n \nTeetzel said the cost of electricity is not enough to drive an established business out of state, but would be a consideration when planning a new business. Electric rates are a business consideration, he said, \"but not a reason to move.\" \n \nHe said he's in favor of power supplier Eversource's Northern Pass project, which would bring hydropower to the region from Canada, while acknowledging the execution is \"challenging.\" Opponents continue to fight the plan and it remains in a prolonged period of regulatory review. \n \nFlynn said the BIA is urging its members to speak out about high electricity costs to \"raise awareness\" of the fact that \"what you're paying here is a lot more than in other states.\" He said it's possible to bring rates down by increasing supply across New England.  \n \nGov. Sununu's spokesman, David Abrams, responded to an inquiry about energy and business in the state with the following statement the governor made in December at the BIA's New Hampshire Energy Symposium. \n \n\"Now there are lots of pieces to that puzzle,\" Sununu was quoted. \"There\u2019s renewable energy. What are we doing with our current infrastructure? We have new plants that are going offline. We have Northern Pass coming in. We have the potential for natural gas, but it has to be done the New Hampshire way. The right way.\u201d \n \nAlso at BIA's New Hampshire Energy Symposium in December, Robert Michalski, vice president of operations for Stratham chocolate maker, Lindt & Sprungli, was quoted by the New Hampshire Union Leader saying the company pays more than $5 million a year for electricity and expects that to rise by another half-million dollars this year.  \n \n\"The concerning part for us is that we are at this point, the company is not willing to grow any more in New Hampshire,\u201d Michalski was quoted by the Union Leader. \u201cThe only way that we\u2019re going to be able to grow in New Hampshire further is by finding ways to reduce our energy, our energy costs in this state.\u201d \n \nA spokeswoman at Michalski's office said last week that he no longer works for Lindt. Asked for someone else to speak on behalf of the company about energy costs, she said no one from the company \"is allowed to be quoted in the media.\"  \n \nEnergy demand on the Seacoast has been cited by Eversource as growing twice as fast the rest of the state. To meet the demand, Eversource currently seeks approval for construction of a new 13-mile transmission line, to run between existing power stations in Portsmouth and Madbury. The state's Site Evaluation Committee is expected to respond to the application this year, while Eversource says it hopes to complete the \"Seacoast Reliability Project\" in 2018. That project is also facing strong opposition from those concerned about the environmental impact of the line. \n \nBehind the scenes, said Don Kreis, a staff lawyer and consumer advocate for the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, Eversource is fighting in the New Hampshire Supreme Court to try to have its customers pay for a new gas pipeline. Kreis said the PUC denied Eversource's plan to pass the pipeline cost onto to consumers and Eversource recently filed an appeal with the state's highest court. \n \nThe PUC describes its mission as \"vested with general jurisdiction over electric, telecommunications, natural gas, water and sewer utilities as defined in RSA 362:2 for issues such as rates, quality of service, finance, accounting and safety. It is the PUC\u2019s mission to ensure customers of regulated utilities receive safe, adequate and reliable service at just and reasonable rates.\" \n \nKreis explained that New England is farther away from cheaper fossil fuels, which has historically been coal, which drives up the cost. Natural gas prices are low and New England is close to sources in Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio, which has led to electric companies arguing there's a need for more gas pipelines to move more gas, he said. \n \n\"We have more than adequate supplies of natural gas, but when it's really cold, natural gas generators, without firm contracts, say they supposedly don't have enough to go around,\" Kreis said. \n \nIn 2014, Eversource, when it was known as Public Service of New Hampshire, purchased land at 445 Route 1 Bypass in Portsmouth for construction of a new electrical substation. In an application to the city to build the substation, PSNH reported it was needed to meet an increased demand for electricity, as well as new development-driven demand. With anticipated new demand for electricity, due to Portsmouth \"projects under development, or in the planning stages,\" PSNH informed the city three years ago that demand for electricity would exceed capacity by 2016, without new infrastructure such as the new bypass substation, that's now in operation. \n \nKreis said expanded infrastructure throughout the region, paired with energy conservation, are the solutions to the area's energy challenges. With that, he said, prices would lower. \n \nHe said businesses can and should conduct energy audits and consider ways to retrofit their operations to reduce energy consumption and affiliated costs. He said energy providers have budgets for a program that offers energy audits and can, as an example, identify parts of a factory using the most electricity and offer suggestions, like more efficient motors. Food factories and businesses, he said, should explore more energy-efficient refrigeration units.  \n \nKreis explained that electricity is traded by the independent group ISO New England and the rate varies every five minutes. ISO brokers the electricity markets, to retailers who sell to customers and from companies that generate electricity. Peak demand for electricity in New England, Kries said, is generally on a hot August afternoon.  \n \nISO spokesman Matt Kakley explained that his organization manages the electricity market like the stock market and doesn't set prices. He said natural gas is the predominant fuel used to create electricity in New England and, \"When the natural gas pipelines transporting gas into New England have room left over after heating customers are served, that cheap natural gas can make it into New England. When the pipelines are running full just to serve heating customers, natural gas prices spike and then wholesale electricity prices go up, too.\" \n \nKakley said at times the pipelines carrying gas into New England aren\u2019t sufficient to transport enough natural gas to meet demand. \n\n \n\"We see this especially on very cold winter days when heating demand for natural gas is high, which coincides with high demand for gas for electricity production,\" he said  Constraints on the natural gas pipelines can push up the price of natural gas, which can also increase the price of wholesale electricity.\" \n \nThe Nothern Pass plan would reportedly create more energy via a 192-mile transmission line bringing hydropower from Canada, but has met resistance. Kreis said Sununu \"has a lot of influence,\" but it's up to a state's Site Evaluation Committee to decide whether to move that forward.  \n \nFlynn said the BIA does not take positions with regard to specific infrastructure projects, but is \"trying to advocate against legislation\" that would make it harder to build new energy infrastructure. The BIA's website \"EnergizeNH\" calls the situation an \"electrical energy crisis\" and calls for \"state and regional policies and initiatives that enable the development of low-cost, reliable sources of energy, including expanded natural gas pipeline capacity and increased electrical transmission, into the region.\" \n \nThe BIA reports it is \"concerned about the high cost of electricity because it makes New Hampshire less competitive, jeopardizes current and future jobs, and threatens the state\u2019s economy as businesses grow (or relocate) operations and employment outside New Hampshire and New England.  \n \nKreis said, \"Speaking as a citizen, we need to find ways to strengthen our economy and not rely on persuading employers not to leave. There's always going to be another state with a better deal. It's true, we have high energy costs, but we have other things that make it a better place to be in business.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Elizabeth Dinan edinan@seacoastonline.com"},"topics":[],"title":"'Energy crisis'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Strafford","zipCode":"03820","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dover","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169683614","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"359"},"name":"Foster's Daily Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fosters.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195736401","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T08:15:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He did a little of that Saturday night, but mostly it was a standard 2-3 zone Kansas deployed \u2013 not with great distinction, but with great effectiveness. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any educational tapes made off that zone tonight,\u201d Self allowed. \n\nHe\u2019s right. Kansas often played hands-down defense, not exactly looking like vintage Syracuse out there. Yet even a not-very-good zone was still good enough to throw the brakes on run-and-gun Kentucky, confuse the young Wildcats and generally bring John Calipari\u2019s offense to a stumbling halt in a 79-73 Kansas triumph . \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t switch defenses much,\u201d Self said. \u201cTonight we did more than we have in a long time.\u201d \n\nBecause it worked. Kentucky all but turned into a pillar of salt for several stretches against the zone. \n\nAnd thus we arrive at the two big takeaways from this game. \n\nFor the winners: the Jayhawks (19-2) showed their veteran poise and focus, rallying from a dozen down on the road, without suspended big man Carlton Bragg and beneath the cloud of an ongoing rape investigation stemming from an encounter in the men\u2019s basketball dorm last month. \n\nFor the losers: the Wildcats (17-4), for all their talent, showed that they\u2019re still not terribly adept at pausing, grinding and thinking their way through the game when the going gets tough. They\u2019ve got the highlight-reel stuff down when the game is a track meet, but chess matches and alley fights aren\u2019t exactly their thing just yet. \n\nFor Kansas, this wasn\u2019t just an emphatic bounce-back from a road loss to West Virginia; it was a victory after losing one of just two reliable interior players in Bragg. Senior Landen Lucas was pretty much on his own, and battled Kentucky five-star freshman Bam Adebayo to a draw (13 points and five rebounds for Lucas, 10 points and eight rebounds for Adebayo). \n\n\u201cWithout Landen,\u201d said Jayhawks freshman Josh Jackson, \u201cI don\u2019t know where we\u2019d be.\u201d \n\nJosh Jackson and Frank Mason led Kansas to an impressive \u2014 and somewhat surprising \u2014 win over Kentucky. (Getty) \nMore \nSelf had to supplement Lucas with Mississippi transfer Dwight Coleby and freshman Mitch Lightfoot, two guys who had a combined 10 DNPs in Kansas\u2019 last eight games. They did their job well enough defensively to keep Kentucky from establishing an effective inside-out offensive game. \n\nIt\u2019s also significant that Self had the best freshman on the floor Saturday \u2013 not Calipari and his annual armada of blue chippers. Jackson was assertive, confident and clutch in racking up 20 points, 10 rebounds, three assists and two steals in 39 minutes of play. \n\n\u201cTo me, he\u2019s a complete basketball player,\u201d Self said. \u201c\u2026 He\u2019s very competitive. He\u2019s very active and has a nose for the ball.\u201d \n\nThe vexing issue for Kentucky is whether its freshmen have a head for the game. Malik Monk and Fox are a gloriously talented backcourt, but against quality opposition they sprinkle in enough unwise possessions to undercut their effectiveness. \n\nIn the Wildcats\u2019 last three losses, to Louisville, Tennessee and Kansas, Fox and Monk have combined for 16 assists and 21 turnovers. Monk has shot 6-for-28 from 3-point range in those games \u2013 and while his shooting from deep wasn\u2019t as bad against the Jayhawks (2 for 6) the problem was a prolonged absence from the offense. \n\nAfter scoring 12 points in the first half \u2013 10 of them in the first 9 ½ minutes \u2013 he didn\u2019t score again until 3:11 remained in the game and Kentucky trailed by eight points. \n\nRead More \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t play seven, eight minutes without him getting a shot,\u201d Calipari said. \n\nAnd yet Kentucky did, bamboozled by a fairly mediocre Kansas zone that served one purpose: making the \u2018Cats work and think. \n\n\u201cSwitching up the zone was just mainly to slow them down,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt played into our favor to turn it into a half-court game. Going to zone really helped us with that.\u201d \n\nAny Kentucky loss is an invitation for the fans to overreact. Two straight losses is a green light to panic, especially with a team some thought might replicate the brilliance of Calipari\u2019s best freshman-led UK teams in 2012 and \u201915. \n\n\u201cThey stink,\u201d Cal said of his back-to-back defeats, while trying to maintain perspective. \n\nIt\u2019s a long season, and the talent is abundant in Lexington. But this freshman class isn\u2019t ready to beat the best yet. \n\nThat goes far beyond the inconsistencies of Monk and Fox, and extends past the hide-and-seek dominance of Adebayo. It includes Wenyen Gabriel, Rivals.com\u2019s No. 13 recruit in the class of 2016, who currently resembles a displaced track athlete more than a skilled basketball player. Gabriel has launched six 3-pointers in the past two games, missing them all, and recorded his first scoreless college game Saturday. And it includes power forward Sacha Killeya-Jones, the Rivals.com No. 24 recruit who is simply not part of the rotation and has played a total of 12 minutes since Dec. 11. \n\nThus Calipari is engaged in another developmental race against the calendar, hoping that February will be the time when this group transforms from good into great. The 10-1 start seems a long time ago right now. \n\n\u201cThis is always a process,\u201d Calipari said. \u201cIn \u201914, we were dying and then we got it at one point, and we took off (advancing to the NCAA tournament title game). This team came together a little faster, and then that execution we\u2019ve been talking about comes back to haunt us.\u201d \n\nIt was Kansas that executed at crunch time Saturday. The Jayhawks have some serious issues to deal with going forward \u2013 more off the court than on it \u2013 but Bill Self can dabble defensively and rely on his veterans (plus one phenomenal freshman) to win big games.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Yahoo Magazines PYC"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Kansas outwits and outgrits Kentucky (Yahoo Sports)","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"NZ","country":"New Zealand"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Yahoo!Xtra","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657675","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Yahoo!Xtra","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://nz.sports.yahoo.com","publisher":"Yahoo!"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195742403","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T03:52:21Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:22Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"https://s.yimg.com/iu/api/res/1.2/4DiHS_RIOLgaiAUnawiqpw--/YXBwaWQ9c2hhcmVkO2NoPTc1Njtjcj0xO2N3PTc1NjtkeD0zMjQ7ZHk9MDtmaT11bGNyb3A7aD0xMzA7cT0xMDA7dz0xMzA-/https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/uYp58sC.k7u0jgN0mI8e8g--~C/Zmk9Zml0O3c9MTQwNDtoPTc1NjtweG9mZj0wO3B5b2ZmPTA7O2FwcGlkPXByb2Rlc2sy/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/95d57273f573effc8095664784a5eeb1"}],"video":[]}}

This ideal conveys that all should be given equal opportunity to achieve success through hard work, determination and initiative. \n \nThe original architect of this phrase, James Truslow Adams, envisioned a nation in which all would have the opportunity to achieve their \u201cfullest stature\u201d regardless of the situation of their birth. A group in our nation that uniquely embodies these ideals is the \u201cDreamers.\u201d \n \nDreamers are our neighbors, co-workers and friends who were brought to the United States unlawfully when they were very young. For many, the U.S. is the only country they\u2019ve ever known. \n \nMost Dreamers identify as American. However, due to circumstances outside their control, they face significant barriers to integrating fully into our communities. Before 2012, Dreamers could not legally work or obtain driver\u2019s licenses. They lived in constant fear of deportation and have faced significant challenges to pursuing higher education. \n \nTo help prioritize immigration enforcement and remove some of the barriers to achieving the American dream, the Obama administration implemented Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in 2012. DACA provides temporary deportation protection and renewable work permits to those who qualify. \n \nDACA recipients must be in school, have a high school diploma or be a veteran, and pass background checks. More than 740,000 DACA recipients now are able to contribute more fully to their communities through the ability to secure a job, pay more in taxes, attend college (although they are not eligible for any federal aid) and obtain driver\u2019s licenses. \n \nWhile polls show that most Americans believe this group should be protected, many criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s use of executive action to protect Dreamers. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to overturn Obama\u2019s executive orders, though what he will do about DACA and Dreamers remains uncertain. \n \nIt is clear that repealing DACA would have disastrous results on our national and state economy. The Center for American Progress recently reported that ending DACA would reduce the overall gross domestic product by $433.4 billion over 10 years. The hit to South Carolina\u2019s GDP would be $247 million annually if workers with DACA were removed from the workforce. This is money that goes back into our local economy and community. \n \nPublic schools rightly invest in students and desire for them to be \u201ccollege and career-ready\u201d regardless of their immigration status. Starting in elementary school, students are taught the value of a college degree and the skills needed prepare them for a successful career. \n \nYet for Dreamers, college and a career are within reach with a big asterisk at best. For most students, high school graduation is a day of boundless opportunity, but for Dreamers, it can be a day of anxiety and disappointment. \n \nThrough my work at SC Test Prep, an area nonprofit that provides college readiness to students who are college bound but have financial need, and as a local leader with Bibles, Badges and Business for Immigration Reform, I have had the privilege of working with Dreamers. These are students who achieve good grades, volunteer in their communities and aspire to contribute fully to American society \u2014 despite the constant threat of deportation for those who have not received deferred action. \n \nA growing movement in Spartanburg, through the Spartanburg Area Chamber of Commerce and the Spartanburg Academic Movement, encourages a higher level of bachelor\u2019s degree attainment among its residents. The goal is for 40 percent of Spartanburg residents to have bachelor\u2019s degrees by 2030. We cannot overlook how Dreamers can be a part of helping Spartanburg meet this goal. \n \nWith bipartisan support, Sen. Lindsey Graham has introduced the BRIDGE Act, which would temporarily extend protection for those who qualify for DACA while Congress works out a longer-term solution. The BRIDGE Act is a short-term answer for those who believe in what DACA has achieved but believed it was an overreach in presidential power. \n \nThe new Congress has much work to do. For the new administration, repealing DACA and placing Dreamers in jeopardy of losing their jobs, licenses and ability to contribute economically to their communities \u2014 not to mention deportation \u2014 should not be a priority. Members of Congress should quickly pass the BRIDGE Act. Then they should direct their attention to passing long-term immigration solutions. \n \nAmerica is great when all who consider themselves American have the opportunity to pursue success and upward mobility. Protecting the vulnerable and providing opportunities for individual achievement embody the values that make our country great. \n \nHere at home, we are one Spartanburg. Our entire community will thrive when each resident, regardless of the situation of his or her birth, has the opportunity to pursue the American dream. \n \nMeghan Smith of Spartanburg is program director for SC Test Prep and a local leader with Bibles, Badges and Business for Immigration Reform.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MEGHAN SMITHGuest columnist"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Meghan Smith: Helping 'Dreamers' benefits all","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Spartanburg","zipCode":"29304","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Spartanburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Spartanburg Herald-Journal","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169701472","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"562"},"name":"Spartanburg Herald-Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.goupstate.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195755756","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

From time to time, friends or neighbors would hesitate to \u201cconfess\u201d that their son or daughter had chosen to attend a regional comprehensive university or perhaps begin their studies at a two-year institution, fearing I would assume all students should attend a large public research university. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. \n \nEach student brings a unique set of preferences and priorities that determines the best fit for him or her. Desired major, intended career path, academic preparation, preferred class size, campus amenities, level of independence and financial resources influence a student\u2019s choice. \n \nNot only is each student different, each institution is different. Each has its own mission and role. No single university can meet every need, nor should it. Higher education requires the contributions of each type of institution in order to reach its full potential. \n \nA high-quality college education is essential in our knowledge-based economy, and the University of South Carolina System is committed to turning the college education dream into a reality for as many South Carolinians as possible. \n \nAlthough proudly part of a system, senior comprehensive universities like USC Upstate have a specific institutional role to play on the landscape of higher education. Situated in one of the state\u2019s fastest growing regions, USC Upstate was recognized as a top 10 regional college in the South by U.S. News and World Report. \n \nUSC Upstate\u2019s success and continued growth is necessary for South Carolina, but it is even more vital to the region. A core part of the mission of institutions like ours is a responsibility to partner with, and work to improve, our communities. Dubbed the metropolitan mission, USC Upstate is committed to engaging with our community partners on multiple levels. \n \nOur beautiful 330-acre campus has a major impact on our community. As an extension of our academic mission, we host cultural and sporting events and enhance the community with our library, gallery spaces, 12-acre arboretum and protected green space. \n \nIn addition, USC Upstate has a direct economic impact through our 550 full-time and 500 part-time employees serving approximately 6,000 students. Using a model developed by the S.C. Department of Commerce, a conservative estimate of the USC Upstate economic impact shows that the university put $152,437,408 into the local economy in 2015-2016. \n \nWith state funding of about $11 million a year, USC Upstate continues to demonstrate an ability to leverage the state\u2019s investment into a significant impact for our community. Moreover, we graduate more than 1,100 students each year and have 26,000 alumni with 85 percent remaining in the Upstate after graduation. \n \nThe Spartanburg Area Chamber of Commerce, in its 2020 Vision, identifies increasing college graduation as a major driver for our economic future. At USC Upstate, we share this vision and stand ready to help shape the region\u2019s future over the next 50 years. \n \nUSC Upstate already offers a full range of professional and liberal arts degrees, but we are keenly aware of changing demographics and are committed to fulfilling regional and state workforce needs. As we develop new programs, we are working in collaboration with business, industry and our two-year college partners to provide classroom experiences that will help students easily transition to the workplace. \n \nIn the past 10 years alone, USC Upstate has opened programs in engineering technology management, computer information systems, informatics and health informatics and is poised to offer new degrees in advanced manufacturing and urban and regional studies. In response to the Institute of Medicine recommendation that all nurses hold a bachelor of science in nursing (BSN), we expanded our RN to BSN program. We are committed to a flexible learning model, offering these degrees online, in various locations on and off campus, in the evenings and on weekends. \n \nWhen I became USC Upstate\u2019s interim chancellor, I was intrigued by the unique niche the university occupies in the community. As I began preparations to celebrate our 50th anniversary, I was reminded of the rich heritage of collaboration between the university and the Upstate community. \n \nThrough the Spartanburg County Commission for Higher Education, the public provided the land to establish the institution and also paved the way for its growth. The community further entrusted us with its most precious resource \u2014 students. \n \nOur very first program, nursing, was developed to avert a serious health care labor shortage in the region when Spartanburg General Hospital eliminated its nursing program. That commitment to designing and offering programs to support the community and ensure a strong and productive workforce continues today. It is fundamentally encoded in our institutional DNA. This is USC Upstate. \n \nMary Anne Fitzpatrick, Ph.D., is USC Upstate interim chancellor and Carolina Distinguished Professor of Psychology.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"MARY ANNE FITZPATRICKGuest columnist"},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Fitzpatrick: Creating the future for the Upstate","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Spartanburg","zipCode":"29304","state":"South Carolina","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Spartanburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Spartanburg Herald-Journal","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169701472","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"562"},"name":"Spartanburg Herald-Journal","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","Society"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.goupstate.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195756152","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:28Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Officials say now is the best time for people to make changes to their spending habits. \n\nPARKERSBURG \u2014 With 2017 off to a strong start, officials say now is the best time to take a look at your spending and ways to improve your financial future. \n \nConsumer Credit Counseling Service was founded in Parkersburg in 1971 and offers a wide range of tools and services for area residents. CCCS is a local nonprofit organization dedicated to helping people  recover their financial independence. The organization celebrated its 45th anniversary in September. \n \nExecutive Director John Jackson said there are several things people can do this year to increase their chances of successfully improving their finances and reducing their debt. \n \n\u201cLike with most goals, it\u2019s important to make it achievable,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of times people set themselves up for failure. Even if in the first few weeks or month you\u2019re saving $5-10, that positive momentum sets you up for success.\u201d \n \nJackson said often people with loans or credit card bills make only the minimum payments, which tend to cover only the interest earned on the accounts. \n \n\u201cThat can extend the time to pay it off by years,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you pay even $5-10 more than the minimum payment, that money goes toward the principal of the loan. That will ultimately help pay it off sooner.\u201d \n \nJackson said in many households only one or two people manage the finances, but everyone contributes to spending money, eating food and using utilities. \n \n\u201cIt sounds pretty basic, but having the whole family contribute toward a family budget is really valuable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helps everyone understand the expense and where the money is going.\u201d \n \nPeople should also consider setting up a separate savings account, one apart from their regular checking, so it is not as easily accessed. Putting a few dollars in that account every pay will help build a buffer for use during times of need. \n \n\u201cThis time of year a lot of people get cash as a Christmas gift,\u201d he said. Others may work seasonal jobs or put in overtime to help get a few extra dollars. \n \n\u201cTry to not treat that as extra spending money. Put that away when possible,\u201d he said. \n \nJackson said often families simply don\u2019t realize how much money they are spending on a daily basis, and those micro-transactions for coffee or a burger or an impulse buy add up. \n \n\u201cOne of the things we advise people to do is for five weeks track your expenses. Track all of your expenses, and you\u2019ll be amazed when you look back how much of that was wants versus needs,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the year it is a substantial amount of money.\u201d \n \nJackson said CCCS helps people not only manage their money, but to get ahead of their bills and to eliminate debts. \n \n\u201cWith credit, you can tread water for a very long time. You\u2019re never getting ahead and you\u2019re always in debt to somebody,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can help them map out a course to be debt-free in five years, about 60 months.\u201d \n \nBut that course requires some significant changes, Jackson said. \n \n\u201cThey have to change their spending habits,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to change the way they look at spending and money.\u201d \n \nThe changes work. Consumer Credit Counseling Service has a more than 90 percent success rate, and advisors can help address specific areas of debt, such as medical or student loan debt. \n \n\u201cIf you are struggling to make those minimum payments, if you are starting to get those collection calls, it\u2019 s a great avenue for getting debt-free,\u201d he said. \n \nFor more information on CCCS and the services offered, call 1-304-485-3141 or visit wvccs.org.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Experts: Make a change for better finances","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Wood","zipCode":"26101","state":"West Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Parkersburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News and Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169707085","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"287"},"name":"News and Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsandsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195764137","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Our new council members have a different attitude, and we have set aside money in the budget to go ahead with the cleanup.\u201d \n \nRapp said the city is working with Waste Management to get the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection to give the company a permit to handle asbestos waste at its facility at Dry Run off U.S. 50. \n \n\u201cThey are working on their end to get an asbestos permit, otherwise all the waste will have to go to Bridgeport or Athens,\u201d he said. \n \nLeach said he and the mayor toured the site with a remediation expert. \n \n\u201cWe identified a total of eight major debris piles on the site,\u201d Leach said. \u201cWhat happened is the former owner did some demolition and co-mingled debris and material with non-asbestos matter like block and wood with asbestos, contaminating everything.\u201d \n \nLeach said one thing that will help with expense is if the state will permit an asbestos waste facility closer to Vienna. \n \n\u201cOur goal is if we can get cooperation from the DEP we will not have to go far away,\u201d he said. \u201cOther sites are in Bridgeport and Athens and one charges by weight and the other by volume.\u201d \n \nLeach said a decision on the permit is expected by spring for the facility that was created to hold waste from fracking sites. \n \n\u201cWaste Management created four cells for fracking waste and since that has not developed they are on board for taking the asbestos waste and we can save money on project,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our third application for the $200,000 Brownfields remediation grant and it has been an exercise in persistence.\u201d \n \nRapp said Paul Thornton, Vienna\u2019s community development director, has been working on the grant. \n \nLeach said in 2015 he earned a Master of Laws in energy and sustainable development and the curriculum focused on environmental and hazardous waste law. The experience he gained in voluntary remediation will help the city through the cleanup project. \n \nOnce the remediation is completed, Leach said the city will be able to progress through several phases this year. He said the city will be able to recoup some of the costs from selling the scrap from the old plant. \n \n\u201cThere is a lot of salvage material, a lot of steel, but the piles of debris have to be dealt with first,\u201d he said. \u201cThat plant is built on a concrete pad, once those debris piles are gone its going to get much easier to remediate the rest of the site.\u201d \n \nWhen the site was purchased by the city, it was announced a company was interested in acquiring the site. However,. Rapp said the company is no longer interested. \n \n\u201cTheir project has outgrown the site now and they have moved on to a bigger property,\u201d he said. \n \nSince the purchase, part of the property intended for a new public park has been developing with the addition of the Gold Star Memorial and more is planned for the spring, Rapp said. \n \n\u201cOur park side is developing nicely and the industrial side is cleaning up for new business,\u201d he said. \u201cThat area will have a beautiful view of the Ohio River once everything cleared out. We will start work on the walking trail and for the park, I am looking forward to that with the picnic shelters, some of the original pad for a shelter where Johns Manville used to have a park for employees.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Austria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Europe news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Vienna looking forward to Spencer\u2019s Landing development","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Wood","zipCode":"26101","state":"West Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Parkersburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News and Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169707085","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"287"},"name":"News and Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsandsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195766081","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

They also offer sterilization and vaccines for cats who have no owner. The program was founded in July 2004 and through September of last year, 5,626 cats had successfully been trapped, fixed and returned. \n \nAccording to pets.com, a female cat can become pregnant again essentially right after giving birth to a litter. Mature queen cats go in and out of heat seemingly non-stop, generally once every two to three weeks or so. The heat cycle typically lasts a little more than a week. \n \n\u201cReproducing cats are the problem for overpopulation,\u201d said Habeb. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to spay and neuter your animals.\u201d \n \nIn August 2016, Habeb along with Dawn Wheeler, trap and release expert, began catching the stray cats near the barns of the fairgrounds after local residents reported the colony to them. \n \n\u201cI went down there and realized how many cats there were and immediately wanted to get started,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cThere were kittens, stray cats and some obvious cats that had been dumped by their owners there.\u201d \n \nSave a Kitty also trapped and released many cats that used to make their home behind Dairy Queen in Marietta and have seen a significant decrease in the population there since. \n \n\u201cThere used to be over 20 cats behind Dairy Queen and seven years later, there\u2019s only about four,\u201d said Habeb. \u201cHopefully the same impact will be made at the fairgrounds.\u201d \n \nWheeler said that even with fixing all the cats there, people are going to continue to dump their unwanted cats at the fairgrounds. \n \n\u201cPeople just think it\u2019s a better life there but it is absolutely not,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve brought cats to the vet with me and nursed them back to health. It\u2019s just very sad.\u201d \n \nWheeler has also been working with the Humane Society of the Ohio Valley (HSOV) in hopes of starting a trap and release clinic in Marietta. According to Wheeler, the HSOV took a workshop last November learning how to successfully trap, neuter and release the cats in the county. \n \nLocal residents that walk the River Trail near the fairgrounds said they are hopeful that this will help the population decrease. Several community members have helped feed and care for the cats there over the last decade. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long process since last fall to catch all these cats and fix them,\u201d said Judy Adamson of Marietta, who walks the trail. \u201cSave a Kitty is an amazing group of people doing what they\u2019ve done and continue to do in the area.\u201d \n \nWalker Ann Corbett of Marietta said she is optimistic that this will help the cats find homes. \n \n\u201cAll the cats have been fixed and have all their shots,\u201d she said. \n \n\u201cI am ever grateful for everything Save a Kitty has done.\u201d \n \nCorbett said she believes many of the cats are adoptable. \n \n\u201cFriendly is a really nice cat and several of them are beautiful and would make wonderful pets,\u201d she said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Save a Kitty program continues in Washington County","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Wood","zipCode":"26101","state":"West Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Parkersburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News and Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169707085","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"287"},"name":"News and Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsandsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195767265","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Ruud. \n \nThe college will begin an immediate search for a faculty member to head the program and begin developing the curriculum this fall and start the program as a new major in the fall of 2018, Ruud said. More details about the new major and renovations to the existing music program will be announced later this semester. \n \nCurrent and prospective students who are interested in the music therapy program can work with academic affairs to make sure they are taking the appropriate classes that will eventually be incorporated into the new major, the college said. \n \n\u201cWe are grateful for the generosity of the Ritter family. This gift holds special meaning as Don and Leslie first envisioned a music therapy program at Marietta about a decade ago, and their dedication has seen this project through to now,\u201d Ruud said. \u201cDon and Leslie saw a demand for the program, and we are glad they wanted to make this investment in Marietta. We will move quickly and start graduating high-quality music therapy students.\u201d \n \nMusic therapy is the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship, the college said. Board-certified music therapists work in medical, psychiatric and educational settings to help clients improve psychological and physiological functioning. \n \n\u201cWe are pleased to be in a position to start this program at Marietta. Music therapy has been a cause near to us since our involvement with Blue Star Connection, and we have always thought the program would be an ideal addition to Marietta College,\u201d said Don Ritter, trustee emeritus. \u201cIt is a major that should attract dozens of new students, enhance the offerings for current music majors, and help with the diversity needs of the campus \u2014 as 90 percent of the music therapists are female. Marietta is ideally suited to bring this program to the community, and it will also serve to integrate psychology into the broader mix at Marietta, and provide another professional program associated with the medical industry.\u201d \n \nWhile Don Ritter has a long career in oil and gas, he also is a director with Blue Star Connection, a charity that provides musical instruments for medically challenged children and young adults. About 500 individuals and 54 hospitals have received support from Blue Star over the last 10 years. \n \nThe Ritters also founded Category 5 Amplification, a custom guitar amplifier company. They started the company in January 2006 and the company\u2019s endorsing artists include musicians Brad Paisley, Joe Bonamassa, The Kenny Chesney Band and Warren Haynes. \n \nCategory 5 was formed to support charities and to provide musicians an avenue for giving back. \n \n\u201cWe also hope the renovation of The Gathering Place, with the addition of a recording studio, will enhance the offerings of the Music Department, help with accreditation of the music program, and provide a venue and opportunity to allow students to create music and bring live performances to a new level at Marietta,\u201d said Leslie Ritter, a principal in Square Knot LLC \u2014 a consulting firm that specializes in executive coaching, merger integration and execution of human resource strategy. \n \n\u201cIn addition, there will be opportunities for non-music majors to form bands, rehearse, jam and build new relationships with students through the magic of music.\u201d \n \nThe Ritters are challenging the rest of the Marietta community to join them in enhancing the program further. There is a $500,000, 1-to-1 match available over the next five years to add an endowment and further bolster the program. Additional naming opportunities are available. \n \nMarietta College offers a bachelor\u2019s of arts in music and a bachelor\u2019s of music in music education and vocal performance. Marshall Kimball, chairman of the Edward E. MacTaggart Department of Music at Marietta, is overjoyed with the gift the Ritters are making. \n \n\u201cWe in the Music Department are incredibly grateful to the Ritters for this wonderful donation. Because of the size of the donation, this will change the face of the department at Marietta College and the entire college in many ways,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cWe will begin a national search for a certified music therapist to write a curriculum and start up the program. That person will start in the fall of 2017, and recruitment for the first class will occur during the 2017-18 academic year.\u201d \n \nDon Ritter is the CEO of Endurance Resources, an oil exploration and production enterprise focused on the Delaware Basin in West Texas and Southern New Mexico. He helped found the company in 2008 following a career with Mobil Oil and then GeoMechanics International. Endurance Resources was recently sold.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Marietta College receives $1M gift for music program","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Wood","zipCode":"26101","state":"West Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Parkersburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News and Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169707085","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"287"},"name":"News and Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsandsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195771618","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

Wade decision in January 1973, and as they did again Friday, they barely get a nod from the media. \n \nOf course, anti-abortion activists are far less flamboyant. They don't bring in rock stars like Madonna to address the crowds in expletives. They don't carry signs with graphic pictures of women's sexual organs. They are not vulgar. \n \nDespite deep differences between the pro-life movement and President Barack Obama, there was no denigration or character assassination of our former president, even though he ignored the March for Life while becoming the first sitting president to address the annual meeting of Planned Parenthood. \n \nHere's the difference. Pro-life means respect for the sanctity of life, and respect for life means respect for everyone. Although we use the language of rights, it is really about responsibilities. \n \nWhen it comes to abortion, there is no good news as long as the life of one child is pointlessly and cruelly extinguished. But abortion numbers are down. And this is good. According to a new report from the Guttmacher Institute, abortions in the U.S. in 2014 totaled 926,200, the fewest since 1974. \n \nThe basis for a society is human beings, and the \"me\" culture produces fewer new people. Bringing children into the world and raising them takes three things that don't work well with the \"me\" culture: work, sacrifice and love. \n \nAccording to the latest report from Centers for Disease Control, the nation's Total Fertility Rate, which is the average number of children produced by an adult American woman during her lifetime, is now 1.84. It is estimated that a Total Fertility rate of 2.08 is necessary to maintain a population where it is. So America is shrinking. \n \nThis means also that America is aging. There will be fewer in the workforce to pay taxes and keep our economy growing to support the retirement and health care requirements of an elderly population. There will be more Americans growing old alone, growing old without children and family to care for them, physically and emotionally. \n \nMarching on Washington, screaming profanities to excite reporters looking for a story, may get a rise today. But our country is slowly disappearing. \n \nThe pro-life crowd is less flamboyant because it is steeped in a culture of respect, reverence for life and the wisdom of the ages. It may get less press. But without it, we have no future. \n \nStar Parker is an author and president of the Center for Urban Renewal and Education (CURE).

They were all in immediately,\u201d said Kimberly Griffey of Joining Community Forces, adding the process hasn\u2019t gone as fast as she would have liked. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was because of the holidays,\u201d said Griffey, \u201cbut we think it is a worthwhile program to help our veterans get the transportation they need to get around town.\u201d \n \nThe organization provides resources and referrals and works with families of veterans and servicemen on active duty. \n \n\u201cEvery state has one. The JCS is a group of local businesses and organizations who are working together to address concerns with the military community. The closest one to Parkersburg is in Clarksburg and it is very active,\u201d Griffey said. \u201cThey prepare brown bag lunches for the veterans traveling to the VA Center. When we got involved with the initiative, we found transportation was the biggest need for area veterans, so we decided to tackle that. \n  \nPhoto by Jeff Baughan Kimberly Griffey, who works with the Operation Transportation Joining Community Forces initiative, stands in front of a fleet of buses at the Easy Rider bus terminal in Parkersburg. \n \nTim Thomas, general manager of the Easy Rider program, believes the program \u201cis good for the overall community. \n \n\u201cWe owe them (the veterans) a lot.  They are the heroes and it\u2019s good for the Mid-Ohio Valley Transportation Authority to show them how we are willing to help those heroes with their everyday lives,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir dedication of their lives to protect our country. We\u2019re gung-ho to help them because without them I don\u2019t feel like we would be where we are today in this country.\u201d \n \nA one-page application can be quickly prepared and has space for four types of military identification, although only one is needed to complete the application. \n \n\u201cA person needs to have their DD214 (discharge paperwork) with a photo ID, or their Red, White, Blue VA card with photo ID, a driver\u2019s license with veteran stamp or military ID,\u201d Griffey said. \n \nThe possessor of the pass has to only show it to the driver to board with no charge. \n \nThe card is good for the month displayed, she said. \n \n\u201cThat is for an unlimited amount of trips anywhere Easy Rider has routes,\u201d said Griffey. \u201cBut whether one uses it once or 1,000 times in those 30 days, once those 30 days are up, they have to obtain another card. What it amounts to right now, is a temporary card.\u201d \n \nThe new cards will be swipe cards, said Jon Corra, who designed the Operation Transportation logo and the website operationtransportation.org.  The Operation Transportation group also has a FaceBook page, Corra said. \n \nThe new swipe cards will be good for 30 days after the first swipe, he said. \n \n\u201cThen they will have to return for a new card,\u201d Corra said. \n \nThe application is prepared only once, Griffey said. \n \n\u201cThey won\u2019t have to fill out an application each time they get a card,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce they\u2019re in the system, they just have to show a photo ID and they\u2019ll get the card.\u201d \n \nThe slow down has been getting the new swipe cards, Griffey said. \n \n\u201cThey had to order the cards in bulk, around 3,000 or a number close to that, so it\u2019s taking a little while,\u201d she said. \n \nAbout $3,500 was raised to get the program off the ground, Corra said. \n \n\u201cAnd the program is still in its infancy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to do more in the community and we\u2019re looking for ways to reach the rural veterans. Which I mean being anywhere the buses don\u2019t run within the county.\u201d \n \nCorra is the Community Outreach Specialist and Social Media Specialist for Parkersburg attorney Jan Dils. Corra said it didn\u2019t take much to get her involved with the project. \n \n\u201cWe had the fiscal entity with Jan Dils with the \u2018Walk 4 Vets Foundation,\u2019 which is a 501c,\u201d said Corra. \u201cWe used that to accept money to buy the passes and Jan sponsored the spaghetti dinner we used as a fundraiser. \n \nThe group will have to continue raising funds, Griffey said. \n \n\u201cWe are always going to have to raise funds to keep this going, but people have always been very supportive of the military in this area,\u201d Griffey said. \u201cWe\u2019ll make a go of this for a while and continue to work to make it a smooth running operation.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Military news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Easy Rider in Parkersburg offers free pass for military service","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Wood","zipCode":"26101","state":"West Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Parkersburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News and Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169707085","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"287"},"name":"News and Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsandsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195779687","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Without funds for an attorney, I accepted deferred probation. It has followed me my entire life. \n \nI graduated from college, law, and graduate school, yet I had to endure a hearing to ascertain my fitness to practice. It also caused employment rejection. \n \nLater, as assistant county attorney in El Paso, and elected district attorney in Willacy County, I routinely dismissed pot cases. Prosecutor\u2019s offices have limited budgets, yet mountains of cases. Dismissing marijuana offenses, allowed me to send more dangerous criminals to prison. \n \nEven probation for pot was wasteful. Curfews and reporting requirements should be for prowlers and burglars, not pot smokers. \n \nThis problem persists, as 620,000 Americans were arrested for pot last year. Yes, illegal marijuana creates jobs for probation officers, prosecutors, bailiffs, chemists, clerical staff and many more; however taxpayers get soaked. \n \nCalifornia and three other states legalized marijuana on Nov. 8. Voters were persuaded by the Colorado experience, where $2.4 billion in revenues and 17,000 jobs were created in legalization\u2019s first year. Some of this boom comes from visiting Texans. \n \nThe Denver Post polled, \u201cWould you repeal legalization?\u201d The answer; \u201cNo\u201d, by a 51 percent to 36 percent margin. Gallup\u2019s 2016 poll showed support for legalization has grown to 60 percent nationally, and recent studies demonstrate no increased use among youngsters since legalization. Colorado is booming, and other states want what they\u2019re smoking. \n \nThe old \u201cReefer Madness\u201d arguments against marijuana have been dispelled. Today\u2019s legalization opponents such as Insys Therapeutics, which develops synthetic painkillers, poured $500,000 into the \u201cNo\u201d vote in Arizona. It\u2019s these legal painkillers which cause so much addiction and harm. \n \nPrescription drugs increase our health costs and Big Pharma doesn\u2019t want competition. The Catholic Church was also a huge contributor, with the Boston Archdiocese donating $850,000 to oppose Massachusetts\u2019 marijuana initiative. \n \nOne lingering anti-pot argument is that people will ingest and drive. This happens anyway and it will be illegal everywhere. \n \nNot satisfied, opponents wonder how they will test for marijuana. Field tests still work, but how about we just arm each officer with a chocolate bar, and they could cuff the stoned drivers as they grab for it. \n \nLegalization will come eventually, as it\u2019s only the oldest age groups who are opposed. \n \nAn estimated 15 million Americans use marijuana regularly, and about half our population has admitted trying marijuana. \n \nMarijuana decriminalization bills for the 2017 Texas Legislature, have been filed, including one by El Paso\u2019s own Joe Moody. \n \nRepublicans are increasingly in favor, because of the fiscal benefits and individual freedom arguments. Democrats are already there, and almost everyone wants to decrease the power of the violent drug cartels who smuggle pot across our border. \n \nLet\u2019s legalize it, and have Mexico put up the wall to keep Texans from trafficking marijuana into their country. \n \nEl Paso attorney Steve Fischer has been a professor of criminology and a Texas State Bar director.

There will be re-enactments of well-known local historical trials using the laws in place at those times. \n \nBritton said the first will be the \u201cGeorge Washington Henderson vs. David Putnam Fugitive Slave Trial\u201d featuring George Washington Henderson of Henderson Hall in what was still part of Virginia at that time and David Putnam, a noted local abolitionist in Marietta of the period. \n \n\u201cIt was a fairly famous local case and involved national law and national people,\u201d he said. \n \nThe Castle will also be having an \u201cArt Outside\u201d program in the summer with local artists coming to The Castle to do painting of the historic home and grounds and other subjects. In the fall, a \u201cTop Shelf History\u201d program will look at Prohibition and the impact and presence of alcohol in Marietta during that period, he said. \n \nThe Castle provides educational programs and tours of the restored home at 418 Fourth St., along with special musical concerts and hands-on activities for children and adults throughout the year. \n \nThe Castle is an 1855 Gothic Revival house which was the home of an Ohio state senator among many others over the years. It has housed some of the Marietta area\u2019s most prominent and influential citizens, including potter Nathaniel Clark and attorney Melvin C. Clarke, who helped add onto the home. The Castle was deeded to the Betsey Mills Corp. in 1992. It opened to the public in 1994. \n \nThe Castle\u2019s education program for third-, fourth- and fifth-graders is very extensive. The Castle also exhibits artifacts of the Marietta area. Some of those relate to former owners of The Castle while others come from the Victorian era and from the history of Marietta. \n \nThe Castle is closed during the winter, except for special events and reserved group tours. \n \nIt will open to the public in April and will be open five days each week through June 1, when it opens for all seven days of the week until the fall. \n \nThe schedule of activities includes: \n \n* Feb. 16: Third Thursday Talk \n \n* Feb. 20: History on Trial \n \n* March 4: Victorian Tea \n \n* April 7: Lest We Forget: Remembering Washington County in the First World War \n \n* April 20: Third Thursday Talk \n \n* April 30: Cultural Caravan \u2014 The Ceramic Heritage of Southeastern Ohio \n \n* May 8: Food History \u2014 The Nifty Fifties of Norwood \n \n* May 20: Herb Day Luncheon \n \n* June 4: Cemetery Tours \n \n* June 15: Third Thursday Talk \n \n* June 17: Cemetery Tours \n \n* June 22: Garden Party Fundraiser \n \n* July 1: Cemetery Tours \n \n* July 8: The Castle\u2019s Cultural Car Pool \n \n* July 10: History Camp \n \n* July 17: Archaeology Camp For Kids \n \n* July 22: Cemetery Tours \n \n* July 29: Art Outside at The Castle \n \n* July 31: Archaeology Field School for Adults \n \n* Aug. 5: Cemetery Tours \n \n* Aug. 17: Third Thursday Talk \n \n* Aug. 19: Cemetery Tours \n \n* Aug. 26: Top Shelf History \n \n* Sept. 18: Food History \u2014 A Presidential Proceeding \n \n* Sept. 23: Princess Ivy\u2019s Quest \n \n* Oct. 19: Third Thursday Talk \n \n* Oct. 21: \u201cFor Victory\u201d Washington County Responds to World War I \n \n* Oct. 27-28: Ghost Tours \n \n* Nov. 4: Night at the Museum \n \n* Nov. 18: Gingerbread House Workshop \n \n* Dec. 2: Christmas Tour and Tea \n \n* Dec. 21: Solstice Watch","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Special activities planned at The Castle in Marietta","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Wood","zipCode":"26101","state":"West Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Parkersburg","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"News and Sentinel","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169707085","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"287"},"name":"News and Sentinel","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newsandsentinel.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195783380","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The second seeds finally got on board when Dodig held the fifth game but they had already suffered the damage. \n \nServing to stay in the opening set at 1-5, Sania saved a deciding a point to hold. \n \nSpears was now serving for the set and lost the first two points to be 0-30 and soon Dodig found a forehand winner to earn a breakpoint but could not convert. \n \nSania hit a backhand wide on the deciding point to concede the first set. \nDodigs serve was again under pressure as he faced a breakpoint and a deciding point in the first game of the second set but managed to save both. \n \nCabal served a double fault at 40-30 to face a deciding point and the second seeds latched on to that to take a 2-0 lead as Spears hit a backhand long. \n \nSania had an easy hold to make it 3-0 as the Indo-Croatian pair was back in the match. However, Sania was broken in the seventh game which allowed the rivals to neutralise the advantage. \n \nThe Indian committed a double fault to be down by two breakpoints and Spears smashed one overhead volley to convert the first. Spears held without fuss and the two pairs were now locked 4-4. \n \nDodig was never in his elements in todays match and he served two double faults, the second one coming on a breakpoint, to allow Cabal to serve out the championship.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Sania and Dodig end runner-up at Australian Open","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"PK","country":"Pakistan"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"KunMail.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"612368866","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"KunMail.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kunmail.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195785164","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:07Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But what\u2019s even worse than losing is losing without a fight. \n \nThis was all too painfully evident in Team Pakistan\u2019s 1-4 thrashing by Australia in the ODI series. Just before that, Pakistan were clean swept in the three-match Test series by the Aussies. A few weeks prior to that, the Green Shirts were also whitewashed by New Zealand in Tests. \n \nPakistan managed to win only one match (Melbourne ODI) in their last 10 international matches \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of beating. Throughout these last few forgettable months, our fielding stood out as a glaring cause of embarrassment for the team as well as the fans. It let down the bowlers as well as the batsmen, it let us all down. \n \n\nAzhar Ali lets the ball through, Pakistan vs Australia/CA/ \n \nAll throughout the series, Pakistan were seen dropping valuable catches, fumbling the ball in the outfield and missing the stumps in widely misjudged overthrows. In the fourth ODI in Sydney alone, the team dropped eight catches altogether, in perhaps the worst fielding performance by any side in recent history. \n \nSimply put, the dropped catches cost us the matches. Our batting and bowling were relatively competitive. What made all the difference between the top-ranked Australia and the eighth-ranked Pakistan was the fielding, something which head coach Mickey Arthur admitted himself when he said Pakistan were still \u201cway behind the pack\u201d in this arena. \n \n\"Me and my support staff have been around for about seven months, and that's been a focus and priority \u2013 fitness levels have improved dramatically in terms of our day-to-day reports. \n \n\u201cBut we're way behind the rest of the pack. \n \n\u201cSo fitness and fielding again is going to be total priority before we go to the West Indies (later in the year),\u201d Arthur said at the end of the tour. \n \n\nWahab Riaz reacts, Pakistan vs Australia/ \n \nWeren\u2019t fitness and fielding top priority before? Pakistan\u2019s fielding has never been something to boast about, but when Arthur and Steve Rixon, the team\u2019s fielding coach, were appointed ahead of the England tour in the summer of 2016, this is exactly what they had said at that time as well. \n \nSo why has there been no improvement at all? If anything, the fielding seems to have even worsened over the past few months. But why is no one asking the hard questions? \n \nWhere are we lacking in terms of fielding? What goes on in our training camps and practice sessions? Where are the loopholes and why haven\u2019t they been spotted yet? If they have been spotted, why haven\u2019t they been fixed yet? \n \nNobody drops catches or misfields deliberately, of course. So, is it because our players become complacent in the field and lack razor-sharp concentration? Or is it the nerves when playing in front of massive crowds at international grounds? \n \n\nHasan Ali fumbles the ball, Pakistan vs Australia/ \n \nWhether it\u2019s complacency or nerves, our coaching staff, especially Steve Rixon, have a lot to answer for and work on. They need to coach players to give as much importance (if not more) to fielding as batting and bowling. Fielding needs to be made a crucial assessment criterion for players\u2019 performances, both in training camps and international matches. \n \nMisfielding also has its roots in psychological pressure. Our players visibly feel pressured during fielding, because they already know their fielding skills are in the spotlight. Perhaps they are so afraid of dropping a catch when it comes their way, that they end up doing exactly that. It\u2019s like a vicious trap. And it\u2019s all in the head. In that case, the coaching needs to focus on relieving the players of this mental pressure. Our coaching staff needs to target the players\u2019 psyches and train them accordingly. \n \nBut the more important question is, why hasn\u2019t this been done already? And if the coaches have indeed attempted this, then why are the results not showing? \n \nIt\u2019s time for some tough questions, and it\u2019s also time for accountability. Pakistan are already on the edge of losing out on direct qualification for the next World Cup, and these questions need to be answered soon enough. \n \nThe writer is a producer at Geo.TV and tweets @Mariaa_54","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Pakistan news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Did no one tell Pakistan \u2018catches win matches\u2019?","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"PK","country":"Pakistan"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"KunMail.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"612368866","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"KunMail.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kunmail.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.geo.tv/","https://twitter.com/Mariaa_54"],"sequenceId":"695195785810","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:12:07Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n\nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen. Tashfeen Malik was from a family of wealthy landowners in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia with her immediate family. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a US citizen. \n\nPakistan and Saudi Arabia, however, are not on the list of countries subject to the new ban. \n\nThe administration is facing criticism from leaders in the U.S. and around the world for taking steps their critics say are unconstitutional and anti-American. \n\nThe second mention of San Bernardino came when the official was trying to explain why there was no grace period before the executive order went into effect, to help ease implementation. \n\n\"Imagine if this had been an executive order that had been contemplated the day before the San Bernardino shooter entered the United States?\" the official asked. \"Would have delaying its implementation served the best interests of the country? The reality is we don't know who the next individual is who will exploit our immigration programs successfully.

He got tired. Missed two layups. Missed two free throws,\" Gaels coach Randy Bennett said. \"But he got us the lead, put us in the situation we were. He was really good.\" \n\nLandale had five turnovers and sat the final 10 minutes after picking up his fourth foul. But senior point guard Joe Rahon said the Gaels have great confidence in their big man. \n\n\"He has great touch around the rim, so when he misses one, that's a rarity,\" Rahon said. \"He's been great all year, and we're going to keep riding him.\" \n\nThe Gaels (19-2, 9-1 West Coast Conference) won their fourth straight game and beat Santa Clara for the 14th time in their past 16 meetings. \n\nEmmett Naar added 15 points and nine assists for Saint Mary's, which led 53-37 with 10 minutes left before the Broncos rallied within 55-50 with six minutes remaining. The Gaels never panicked and made 11 of 12 free throws in the final five minutes to secure the victory. \n\n\"On the road it's tough. You're going to go up 15 and they're always going to come back,\" Rahon said. \"This year, we're a year older, more mature and better able to handle it.\" \n\nNate Kratch led Santa Clara (12-11, 6-4) with 19 points, including 14 in the first half. Broncos senior Jared Brownridge, a 2,000-point career scorer and No. 4 this season in the WCC at 18.8 per game, made just one of his first 10 shots against defense by Rahon and finished with 13 points. \n\n\"That guy's really hard to guard,\" Bennett said of Brownridge, who entered with five straight 20-point games. \"They bring him off so many screens. He's one of the best players that's played in this conference. But Joe is a really good defender. That was key.\" \n\nSanta Clara's first-year coach Herb Sendek said Brownridge's 3-for-14 night was only partly caused by the Gaels' defensive work. \n\n\"Give them credit \u2014 they did a good job. And he probably didn't have his 'A' game tonight,\" Sendek said. \"He's had a terrific year and we ask him to do a lot.\" \n\nBIG PICTURE \n\nSaint Mary's: The Gaels kept pace one game behind WCC leader Gonzaga and moved within one victory of 20 wins for a 10th straight season. \n\nSanta Clara: After beating BYU two nights earlier, it remains alone in fourth place in the WCC after losing for just the second time in seven games. \n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS \n\nEven with two victories this week, Saint Mary's figures to remain at or around its current spot at No. 21. The Gaels don't get another chance to make a major impression on Top 25 voters until their Feb. 11 home game against unbeaten Gonzaga. \n\nRahon said he didn't even know where the Gaels are ranked. \n\n\"We know if we get two wins every week we'll probably stay up there in the rankings,\" he said. \"You drop one and people love to drop us out.\" \n\nCASHING IN AT THE LINE \n\nThe Gaels made 16 of 20 free throws, with Naar making all four of his attempts to improve to 30 for 31 (96.8 percent) in WCC play. \n\n\"Free throws win games \u2014 it's the old cliche, but it's true,\" Rahon said. \"If you go to the line and come up empty, they come down, they get layups, they get 3s and that's the ballgame. When it's time to knock them down, we try to do that.\" \n\nAILING BRONCOS: Injuries have stalled the Broncos all season, and they played Saint Mary's with just eight healthy scholarship players because sophomore Matt Hauser, their third-leading scorer (10.2) was ill and could not play. \n\nUP NEXT \n\nSaint Mary's visits Pacific on Thursday. The Gaels led by as many as 19 points on the way to beating the Tigers 62-50 on Jan. 19 in Moraga. \n\nSanta Clara plays Thursday at Portland. The Broncos beat the Pilots 70-42 on Jan. 5 at Santa Clara when Brownridge passed 2,000 points for his career.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Landale leads No. 21 Saint Mary's past Santa Clara","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Merced","zipCode":"95340","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Merced","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Merced Sun-Star","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169661579","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"15"},"name":"Merced Sun-Star","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mercedsunstar.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195793866","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:40Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The home was built around 1810 by Col. Hugh Phelps, Capt. James Neal\u2019s son-in-law, according to the National Register. Through lore and other documents, the home may have been built in 1799 and was the actual place where Wood County was formed, said Bob Enoch.

The home was built around 1810 by Col. Hugh Phelps, Capt. James Neal\u2019s son-in-law, according to the National Register. Through lore and other documents, the home may have been built in 1799 and was the actual place where Wood County was formed, said Bob Enoch. \n \nPARKERSBURG \u2014 With reverence for the past, the Wood County Historical and Preservation Society is converting the Phelps-Tavenner House, the oldest residence in the county on an original site, into a research and educational center. \n \n\u201cWe have a lot to do,\u201d said Paul Bibbee, a director of the historical society. \n \nBuilt in 1810, when the region was the American frontier, the Phelps-Tavenner House was acquired by the historical society in 2015. Since its construction and up until 2014, the last owners being the Life family, the house at present-day 2401 Camden Ave., was used as a residence.  The home is now called the Phelps-Tavenner Research Center. \n \nThe National Register lists the house as being built circa 1810, but through lore and other documents \u201cwe feel it was probably built prior to 1799 and is the actual place where Wood County was formed,\u201d said Bob Enoch, president of the historical society. \n \nThe house had probably been remodeled to some extent over the years and the newspaper ran a story about a major renovation in the 1950. \n  \nPhoto by Jess Mancini From left, Paul Bibbee, Dottie Bibbee and Diana Hill of the Wood County Historical and Preservation Society sit in Hannah\u2019s Room, the 1950s style kitchen at the Phelps-Tavenner Research Center on Camden Avenue. The society has been restoring parts of the house, which was the oldest continual residence in use on an original site in Wood County. \n \nThe renovations included a 1950s-style kitchen that is part of the history, too, said Dottie Bibbee, Paul Bibbee\u2019s wife and a vice president of the society. \n \n\u201cThis is part of the house, too,\u201d she said. \n \nRooms of the house have been named after its historical residents, including Hugh Phelps and his wife, Hannah, Thomas Tavenner, and sisters Hattie and Lydia. The kitchen is named Hannah\u2019s Kitchen. \n \nThe project, with the various aspects being done as it becomes financially feasible, has not been without its exciting moments, Enoch said. \n \nUpon purchase of the home, the society had been told that there was once a spiral, or twisting staircase accessing the second floor, Enoch said. \n  \nPhoto by Jess Mancini The original walls showing where a staircase was located was discovered when the paneling was removed in the Hugh\u2019s Room at the Wood County Historical and Preservation Society\u2019s Phelps-Tavenner Research Center. \n \nAs Enoch and John Huffman, another director with the historical society, were removing paneling from the main living room, they discovered the original steps were visible against the plastered wall. The area of the wall has been framed to show the original construction, Enoch said. \n \n\u201cYou could actually see where the staircase was,\u201d Bibbee said. \n \nHugh Phelps built the home with the original front facing the Little Kanawha River. Though it was customary for houses to face the river, this perhaps also gave Phelps a better view of the ferry he or his slaves operated to cross the river, Enoch said. \n \nIt was a meeting place for the county court and influential residents. Among others who would meet at the home was John Stokely, the first county clerk, who laid out the original settlement preceding the creation of Parkersburg by the daughter and son-in-law of Alexander Parker. \n \nPhelps, a contemporary of Harman Blennerhassett, was a colonel in the 113th Regiment of the Virginia Militia as West Virginia in this period was in Virginia. Phelps was a sheriff and a justice in the county. \n  \nPhoto by Jess Mancini The outside of the Phelps-Tavenner house is shown. \n \nHis father-in-law was Capt. James Neal, who established Neal\u2019s Station in 1785, the first permanent settlement in what was to become Wood County in 1799. \n \nThe house also was the first \u201cordinary\u201d in the county, Bibbee said. An ordinary was the term used two centuries ago for a bar and the prices charged were set by statute, he said. \n \nThe renovation in the home includes a glass-encased portion of an entrance from the kitchen into Thomas\u2019 Room that shows the original brick and the charring of a timber from a fire occurring around the time of the Civil War, Enoch said. The fire stopped at the partition, he said. \n \n\u201cIt didn\u2019t go any further into the main portion of the house,\u201d Enoch said. \n \nMuch is planned for the home, including a children\u2019s area on the upper floors. In addition to restoring portions of the interior, the society hopes to amass a collection of early children\u2019s items for educational uses and redo the roof, possibly using a composite material that will mimic the original wood shingles, Bibbee said. \n  \nPhoto by Jess Mancini Paul Bibbee of the Wood County Historical and Preservation Society reads the order establishing the prices Hugh Phelps could charge at his tavern, the first \u201cordinary\u201d in Wood County. A bottle of wine was a dollar. \n \nPlans also are to landscape the exterior and make it look like a garden from Williamsburg, he said. \n \nThe timeline depends on money, he said. The roof will be a major cost, Bibbee said. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re dedicated to getting it done as quick as we can,\u201d he said. \n \nBibbee believes the house was designed after the home built by Albert Gallatin near Pt.

Letaba Rest Camp \n \nLetaba Rest Camp is situated on the bend of the Letaba River. The camp is midway between the southern and northern boundaries, reports the  Lowvelder . \n \nThe name means \u201criver of sand\u201d. The riverbed is an excellent location for game viewing, particularly elephant. \n \n\n \n2. Orpen Rest Camp \n \nOrpen Rest Camp is situated on the western border of the KNP. It derived its name from the surname of the donor of the land, Eileen Orpen. \n \nIt is an area of scattered trees and wide-open plains populated by the three big cats. You can also look forward to encounters with wild dog. \n \n3. Talamati Bushveld Camp \n \nTalamati Bushveld Camp is situated in a large open valley. Talamati is a Xitsonga word that means \u201clots of water\u201d. \n \nDespite the meaning of the name, the river is actually dry. The clay soil acts as a giant sponge holding a vast reservoir of underground water. The vegetation there is lush all year round and attracts grazers. \n \n4. Sirheni Bushveld Camp \n \nSirheni Bushveld Camp nestles on the edge of the KNP\u2019s northern plains. \n \nThe Mphongolo River flows close by. Sirheni is a Tsonga word that means \u201ccemetery\u201d. There is an elephant graveyard at a site near to the camp. From the camp\u2019s bird hides a wide variety of game and birds can be watched. \n \n\n \n5. Skukuza \n \nSkukuza is a Shangaan word meaning either \u201che who sweeps clean\u201d or \u201che who turns everything upside down\u201d. It is the biggest camp in the park. \n \nSome Krugerholics even call Skukuza the \u201ccapital\u201d of the Republic of Kruger! \n \nIt is close to the Kruger Gate and an excellent springboard to the rest of the Park. \n \n\n \n6. Punda Maria \n \nThe name of the Punda Maria rest camp was given in 1919 by the first ranger to be posted to the area, Captain JJ Coetser. \n \nHe mistakenly named his post Punda Maria in the belief that this was the Swahili name for zebra, the first big game he saw on arrival. \n \nThe correct Swahili name is actually \u201cpunda milia\u201d or striped donkey. When the error was pointed out to him, he chose to retain the name, in honour of his wife, Maria. \n \nDr. Salomon Joubert said that in 1959, the Parks Board changed the name to Punda Miliya. \n \nDr. Van Warmelo, a well-known ethnomologist, said that the name should be spelt Punda Milia and the board accepted that. \n \nIn 1981 Dr. Tol Pienaar did a submission to the board and two acquaintances of Coetzer Hewit Ivy and Astley Maberley said that this is the correct version of how it came about. \n \nThe board accepted the explanation and the name was restored in 1981. \n \n\n \n\u2013  Caxton News Service \n \nRead original story on lowvelder.co.za","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"This is how these six Kruger camps got their names","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Eyethu News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"533456541","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Eyethu News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://eyethunews.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195794576","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Commuters waste minutes and sometimes hours waiting for a trolley that has room enough to pick them up. \n \nOne reporter goes out this snowy evening to see how long it takes for him to catch a southbound trolley on the Fourth Street line. Leaving the office, he arrives at the corner of Fourth and Broadway at 5:55 p.m. He sees three cars go by in ten minutes, but each is too crowded to pick him up, not to mention the ten other people at the corner. \n \nThinking he\u2019ll have better luck if he moves further north, the reporter walks to Fulton Street.

Despite being begged to do so, it also failed to send a grader to allow firefighters access to the Hamabuya farm nor to get aerial support to combat the fire. \n \nThis was despite the Letaba Fire Protection Association having a spotter plane and helicopter on standby and a Working on Fire team being on standby. \n \nMopani insisted it could not call for aerial support because it was not a member of the Fire Protection Association, but the chairperson of the Letaba Fire Protection Association, Trevor Phillips, testified the municipality had been asked in vain many times to become a member. \n \nHe said Mopani was entitled to request aerial support if it wished to do so. \n \nJudge Fourie ruled that Mopani had a legal duty to have taken positive measures by calling for aerial support before the fire became uncontrollable. \n \n\u2013 Caxton News Service \n \nRead original story on citizen.co.za","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"\u2018Negligent\u2019 Mopani municipality to pay for timber farm blaze","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Southern Africa","countryCode":"ZA","country":"South Africa"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Eyethu News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"533456541","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Eyethu News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://eyethunews.co.za"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195794938","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:43Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We urge you to read it. It sure is an eye opener. \n\nThe last few months have been tumultuous for this school board. There hasn\u2019t been a meeting without a notable gaffe. \n\nThere has been an admission of wrongdoing, shouting at a constituent, attempts to censor the press, failure to honor a teacher who passed away suddenly, resolutions placed onto agendas without prior discussion, a board member absent for his swearing in, and other incompetence. \n\nMost of the towns and school districts that we cover post a copy of the meeting agenda on their website 12 to 48 hours in advance of a meeting. In a few cases where the agendas are not posted online, officials comply with our request and provide an agenda prior to a meeting. \n\nAt the beginning of the year, we sent a request asking for the district to provide our staff with a copy of the meeting agenda in advance of their board meetings. The district\u2019s custodian of records said that she would not comply with our request. \n\nThat is not acceptable. It is imperative that public bodies provide their meeting agendas to the public and media prior to the meeting. \n\nWe encourage citizens to attend upcoming board meetings, call the district offices at (609)-268-4600, ext. 5546, and consider filing a petition to become a candidate for the school board. The deadline is April 3 to run for office. \n\nFixing this mess and finding ways to improve transparency and accountability should be a priority for the board, not drones.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Education news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Opinion latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Editorial: Our View On School Happenings","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Burlington","zipCode":"08088","state":"New Jersey","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Vincentown","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Pine Barrens Tribune","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"602220460","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"name":"Pine Barrens Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://pinebarrenstribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195795372","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2551","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Eden","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Eastern Riverina Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"348369418","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Eastern Riverina Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.easternriverinachronicle.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195800519","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Wearing the number 13 jersey for Manchester City could be seen as underlining Willy Caballero\u2019s status as the Premier League side\u2019s reserve goalkeeper.\n\nBut the Argentine leaves nothing to chance, working hard to be ready when called upon to perform the few times he has turned out for the City team, generally in cup competitions.\n\nHe was rewarded with a League Cup winner\u2019s medal last season after his penalty shootout heroics, with three saves against Liverpool, handed City the trophy.\n\nCity were comfortable 3-0 winners at Crystal Palace in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday, but only after Caballero made a reflex save to push away Palace\u2019s first chance on target midway through the first half with the score 0-0.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening to us a lot that the team dominates, has the ball and creates situations and (the opposition) rarely get close but then I had to react when they pressed us at a dead ball situation,\u201d Caballero told Reuters.\n\n\u201cLuckily I was okay and it didn\u2019t go in and that helped us to keep calm because going behind in the score makes things a lot harder.\u201d\n\nManager Pep Guardiola said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t take some of our early chances but that\u2019s been happening all season. The important thing is we created a lot of chances, did score three goals and also kept a clean sheet.\u201d\n\nCaballero had hardly had any work until that chance that fell to Palace forward James Tomkins but he said he and first choice keeper Claudio Bravo work to prepare not to get caught cold in such situations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to it, we live for that\u2026 Opponents get through just once because our team plays better.\u201d\n\nAsked if he is beginning to feel there is a second domestic final coming up for him in the FA Cup this year, Caballero said: \u201cNo, there\u2019s still a long way to go before that, a lot of steps to take.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope it happens but what\u2019s important is that we won to change the team\u2019s dynamics,\u201d he said after City recorded their first win in their last three matches in all competitions.\n\n11TH APPEARANCE\n\nSaturday\u2019s match at an icy cold Selhurst Park \u2014 including a hailstorm in the second half \u2014 was only Caballero\u2019s 11th of the season taking in Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Champions League during which he has kept three clean sheets.\n\n\u201cYou work throughout the week to be prepared for the matches you\u2019re called upon to play. If you train badly you go into the matches with doubts. I try to make the most of every minute I play,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to be in the first team but you have to accept the situation and keep working hard.\u201d\n\nCaballero\u2019s compatriot Sergio Romero, a fellow resident of Manchester as a United reserve, sees even less action despite holding down the first choice place in Argentina team having won a national record 85 caps.\n\nBut he has not had a chance to compare notes with Romero on handling a lack of competitive action.\n\n\u201cWe hardly see each other, Manchester is big and our times don\u2019t coincide, (United) play on different days to us and the free time we have we spend with our families who are the ones that need us most because what hits you most in Manchester is the climate.\n\n\u201c(Romero\u2019s) situation is a subject for long discussion. He\u2019s earned respect and an important career in the national team which he hasn\u2019t been able to reflect at his clubs,\u201d Caballero said.\n\n\u201cAs a goalkeeper, I wish he could \u2026. play and show everyone how good one is.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pity but let\u2019s hope next year (he\u2019ll get more chances to play), since it looks unlikely this season. He can play match after match and show all his qualities.\u201d\n\nCaballero denied he thought about trying to impress the Argentina selectors himself. \u201cAs a reserve I don\u2019t focus on that, first I try to do things well and all that follows is welcome.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: EPL - Manchester City news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"England news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Willy Caballero taking one game at a time in Manchester City\u2019s Cup run","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Indian Express","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660698","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"351"},"name":"Indian Express","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.indianexpress.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195800987","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:18:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/willy-rtr-480.jpg?w=450"},{"url":"http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/willy-rtr-480.jpg?w=480"}],"video":[]}}

Por eso, integrantes de organizaciones sociales, representantes de la institucionalidad y acompañantes internacionales reinstalaron ayer la Mesa Territorial de Garantías para Defensores de Derechos Humanos en Antioquia. \n \nEse espacio de convergencia, que estuvo en crisis durante dos años por tensiones políticas con las administraciones departamentales \u2013anterior y actual\u2013, deberá posibilitar la \u201cinterlocución entre las organizaciones defensoras de derechos humanos y las instituciones del Estado, para la gestión y seguimiento de acciones orientadas a la garantía de la labor de defensa de los derechos\u201d en las nueve subregiones. \n \nSegún Verónica López Estrada, vocera de los defensores, la Mesa también tendrá que propiciar mayores niveles de articulación \u201centre los entes territoriales y la institucionalidad nacional\u201d, con el fin de implementar estrategias y acciones que favorezcan la prevención de riesgos y la protección de los defensores en el desarrollo de su labor en las comunidades. \n \nPara ello, constituirán un comité dinamizador que se reunirá cada dos meses. Aquel estará compuesto por delegados del Ministerio del Interior, la Secretaría de Gobierno de Antioquia, la Subsecretaría de Derechos Humanos de Medellín y las organizaciones defensoras. Ellos gestionarán la adopción de medidas ante las instituciones responsables y harán seguimiento al funcionamiento del espacio. \n \nReconocimiento a su labor \n \nLos defensores de derechos humanos son, a su vez, defensores de la democracia y la paz. Actúan en promoción de los derechos civiles, políticos, económicos, sociales y culturales que están consagrados en la Constitución. También fomentan la construcción de paz y la justicia social. Por esas razones, afirmó Carlos Arcila, subsecretario de Derechos Humanos de Medellín, la labor de los defensores debe ser reconocida. \n \nY así lo exigió Verónica López Estrada, quien exhortó a la administración departamental \u2013y particularmente al gobernador Luis Pérez Gutiérrez, quien no asistió a la reinstalación\u2013 a que se implementen \u201cmedidas administrativas y normativas\u201d para el reconocimiento social de la labor que desarrollan como líderes y defensores en cada uno de sus territorios. \n \n\u201cEsperamos que pronto el gobernador haga un pronunciamiento público reconociendo nuestra labor\u201d, dijo, y añadió que \u201cademás nos damos cuenta de que en los niveles administrativos los funcionarios y funcionarias no tienen tanto nivel de apropiación a nuestra labor; difícilmente nos reconocen, difícilmente nos facilitan el acceso a la información que nos permite seguir con nuestro trabajo de observación, denuncia y articulación con la institucionalidad\u201d. \n \nEn ese sentido Luis Gómez Londoño, viceministerio para la Participación e Igualdad de Derechos del Ministerio del Interior, les solicitó a los miembros de la Mesa que incluyan en el plan de trabajo un acto de reconocimiento a la labor de los defensores de derechos humanos de San José de Apartadó. Y propuso que aquel se realice en la última semana de febrero. \n \nLos están asesinando \n \nÓscar Yesid Zapata, vocero del Nodo Antioquia de la Coordinación Colombia Europa Estados Unidos (Cceeu), recordó que en 2016 se registraron 207 casos de agresiones contra defensores en Antioquia. Y que en lo corrido de este año han sido asesinados dos: José Yimer Cartagena, vicepresidente de la Asociación de Campesinos para el Desarrollo del Alto Sinú (Asodecas), y Edmiro León Alzate, integrante del Movimiento por la Vida y la Defensa del Territorio en el Oriente Antioqueño (Movete). \n \nEn términos generales, adujo, las agresiones han sido cometidas por grupos sucesores del paramilitarismo, como las Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia.

It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2551","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Eden","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Eastern Riverina Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"348369418","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Eastern Riverina Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.easternriverinachronicle.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195809994","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"David Ellery"},"topics":[{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Werriwa Wiener dash claims world dachsund record","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2551","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Eden","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Eastern Riverina Chronicle","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"348369418","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Eastern Riverina Chronicle","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.easternriverinachronicle.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195812241","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:10:23Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:50Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/01e2e8d0-6ac5-4e81-9bc2-708dc395bfb7.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Through her support of missionaries, her joy was expanded being assured many others would hear this life changing message of restoration to fellowship with her Lord. \n\nA memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 1, at the Corvallis Community Church, 310 Second St., Corvallis, MT 59828.

After a series of convincing, the 46-year-old actor finally gave in. \n \nAt the Eko Club in Surulere, Lagos, where this interview was conducted, Ramsey cut a very different picture from the tough guy he portrays in movies. \n \nUnassuming and down-to heart, the actor occasionally took breaks from his squash game to oblige photo requests and banter with excited fans. \n \nQuite reserved, in this exclusive interview with PREMIUM TIMES, the father-of-three opened up on his marriage, addressed stereotypes and his childhood. \n \nPT: Your most recent film, 76 THE Movie, is the talk of town \n \nRAMSEY: The movie is outstanding because a lot of work went into shooting the movie. Portraying a soldier in the movie was a lot of hard work. It took two to three months of rigorous military training to get me into a military state of mind. Principal photography took us six months. \n \nPT: I hear there were times exhaustion crept in during the training. \n \nRAMSEY: Oh yes of course but I never felt like giving up at any time. We were given proper military drills and often times, I complained to the sergeant who took us on the drill. We were drilled mercilessly. We complained but I could not give up. At some point I shouted at the sergeant that I am an actor and not a soldier. The movie was shot in 2012. The movie itself spanned about six to seven years. The pre-production phase was two years; this was before we got the nod of the Nigerian military. \n \nPT: Why were you drawn to the script from the onset? \n \nRAMSEY: From the very first day I read the script I was very concerned. This is because I have always wanted to shoot a historical Nigerian movie. For some reasons, we don\u2019t keep records of our history and this is a sad reality of who we are.The film didn\u2019t totally dwell so much on the assassination of Murtala Muhammed. It just had a bit of it. The story is centered on the struggle of the soldiers and their families. \n \nPT: So there are still certain aspects of the movie that can be explored further? \n \nRAMSEY: We didn\u2019t really shoot the story behind Murtala Muhammed. So it is still very pending. It is the soldiers behind his death. The plotting of the coup and the story was more about the low rank soldiers involved in the coup and what their families went through when they were found guilty of treason. \n \nPT: Aside from acting what have you been up to lately? \n \nRAMSEY: I have been spending time with my family. Whenever the need arises, I get involved in humanitarian and charitable activities. It has been more about film, family and giving back to the society. \n \nPT: Ramsey, your marriage appears to have stood the test of time. You have been married for 15 years now. Some of your colleagues have been unlucky in this regard. \n \nRAMSEY: Contrary to a widely held notion, the success of a marriage largely rests on the woman. But these days, a lot of marriages are based on equality. A woman wants to get 50 per cent of whatever she is giving into the marriage back from the man. This has led to the breakdown of many marriages. From time our mothers used to be the women that held their marriages. They were in charge of the home. Our mothers took charge of everything but today women don\u2019t want that kind of responsibility. Hence, it is affecting marriages. \n \nPT: So, your wife has fared well in this regard? \n \nRAMSEY: My wife belongs to the category of \u201cour mothers\u201d. She believes in sustaining our marriage and holding it strong. \n \nSo whenever I am asked how we have been able to keep it together, I tell them my wife is the woman who has actually held our home. \n \nPT: Do you also accord her rightful place in the home? \n \nRAMSEY: She doesn\u2019t have a place because she owns the home. It\u2019s her call however (way) she wants things done. She is the driver of the family and her decision is final. That is why I say she is not an ordinary woman. She is a triple woman. \n \nPT: Is she comfortable with your romantic and kissing scenes? \n \nRamsey: When some people ask me \u201chow does your wife cope when she sees you kissing other women in the movie?\u201d and I tell them that my wife is special. She is not an ordinary woman. She understands things in a way many other women don\u2019t. That is why I say, an actor or actress, has to find that special person. It is not love that will bond you. Forget love, love dies. What sustains the marriage is companionship. If you cannot find companionship in your partner from the beginning, then you do not have a partner. Don\u2019t lust after a woman because of her beauty and don\u2019t lust after a guy because he is handsome. You must lust after the companionship that bonds you together. It should be like \u201cfor some reasons you cannot do without her; for some reasons there is something about her that brings you home\u201d. It may be her sense of humour; or the way she keeps the home. Same thing applies for the ladies; there must be something about him that you cannot do without. If this quality is not there, then you don\u2019t have a companion. \n \nPT: So, you guys have had it smooth sailing in your marriage all the while? \n \nRamsey: Don\u2019t get me wrong, don\u2019t think that do have our moments of disagreement. But it depends on the way we handle it. Women cannot stand the heat in the kitchen anymore and they just want to run. That is why marriages are crumbling. A lot people don\u2019t want to work hard anymore, because marriage is hard work. So when you talk about marriages crashing, it\u2019s not my call. The only problem that I have is to make sure I provide food for the family. \n \nPT: Any counsel for your colleagues who have been unlucky with love and marriage? \n \nRamsey: Nobody gives advice when it comes to matters of the heart. People say they are going for counseling and all but at the end, it is what is in their heart is still what they want to do. Because those things in your heart are laced with emotions and emotions are very hard to tackle. When you have emotion that is full of jealousy, hate or anger, it is hard to break it until you exercise it. That is why when your dad screams \u2018do not follow that boy\u2019 the teenager does not listen until she has satisfied what her heart desires from the boy. Most times, you learn by experience. Companionship is not easy. When everybody is running into marriages as if marriage wants to go out of fashion, take your time and be ready for it. Be ready to accept someone with his flaws. My wife has her problems and I also have mine. A lot of it actually and I know. You must be able to accommodate the other person. \n \nPT: Let\u2019s take a trip down memory lane. Is acting your dream profession? \n \nRamsey: I wanted to be an aeronautic engineer. I wanted to build planes. Unfortunately I never did sciences in class and I was drawn to the arts. \n \nPT: Why so? Where you bad in mathematics? \n \nRamsey: Yes, my mathematics was terrible. I would have loved to be a pilot or be in the air force. \n \nPT: Divorce is on the rise. Why do you think this is so? \n \nRamsey: When a woman believes she earns more than the man, the man should start doing the work of a woman like sweeping, changing diapers. There is no sense in that. A woman\u2019s place should not change and the same applies to the man. I am not expecting a woman to overwork herself with house chores. I help and support my wife when there is no help in the house. I sweep when I have the time. \n \nPT: In what ways do you also help out in the home? \n \nRamsey: I cooked two days before having this interview. I am a great cook. No woman can do shakara for me oo. I made my stew and rice with smoked chicken. I grew up with my mum and with her, you must know how to sweep and do many other chores. \n \nPT: Some of your fans cannot picture you doing house chores? \n \nRAMSEY: The thing is that everyone now has the perspective of wanting to live larger than life, forgetting the reality. We keep forgetting that if we don\u2019t do it, who will do it? At some point my wife got tired of house helps. We have three kids at home and we have to fend for them. I cannot leave everything for her, so I help out. Sometimes we tell the kids to wash their plates. At some point I realized that my 12 and 13 years old could not sweep and that was very wrong. So we started forcing them to clean. Most kids of these days cannot sweep or clean. All they want to do is do is make their nails, make their hair and carry big phones and tablets around. \n \nPT: Were you rebellious while growing up? \n \nRAMSEY: No I wasn\u2019t. My mother beat discipline into me. I was very playful and I always got into trouble. My mother taught me that my pride as a man is my ability to differentiate between right and wrong. That is why I cannot handle many people at the same time because I cannot sweet talk. I am not very diplomatic. \n \nPT: Are you romantic? \n \nRAMSEY: Don\u2019t judge me by my movie roles. I don\u2019t think I am romantic. My wife does not think I am that romantic either. \n \nPT: Many people wonder why you do not step out with your wife on the red carpet? \n \n Related","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Godwin Clinton"},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Ramsey Nouah: Why marriages are crumbling","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Naija247News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"555279525","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1884"},"name":"Naija247News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://naija247news.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://i1.wp.com/naija247news.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tmp_3594-RAMSEY-NOUAH2-707846453.jpg?fit=768%2C431"],"sequenceId":"695195820266","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

But that doesn't meant that the innovative smartphone that ZTE presented to the world won't be released at some point. \n \nWhen ZTE launched the Kickstarter campaign for the Hawkeye, it wanted to make the smartphone available in just about every country, which is why it put mid-range specs inside and a similar price: $199. \n \nThe Hawkeye stands out from other mid-range phones through its two key feature: eye tracking and adhesive. Adding more high-end smartphone into the mix would have increased the phone's price and make it compete with other flagships launched by companies like Samsung, LG, Huawei, Lenovo and other. \n \nUnfortunately, the ZTE Hawkeye wasn't received too well by Kickstarter backers due to the fact that the smartphone was packing mid-range specs. The reason ZTE made it mid-range is to be able to sell it worldwide, as customers in many emerging markets would not have the money to buy a high-spec phone. \n \nHowever, during the Kickstarter campaign ZTE realized the those backing the project are early adopters who want high-end specs inside their smartphones and they are willing to pay for it. \n \nIn an interview with MobileSyrup , Jeff Yee, ZTE vice-president of technology planning and partnerships, had the following to say about the project: \n \n\u201c In retrospect, yeah, maybe we should have put out a flagship device because the Kickstarter people are early adopters therefore they want flagship specs. So, hindsight is 20/20 but the nice thing about this project is that we\u2019re doing everything with transparency and so early in the process that we can still change and shift .\u201d \n \nYee also said that his company is most likely to pull down the Kickstarter pager, redux the technical specifications list of the Hawkeye and come up with a new crowdfunding campaign very soon. \n \n\u201c Pulling it down [is] most likely because I think the current specs aren\u2019t interesting to people. It doesn\u2019t matter if the campaign is funded or not, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re a startup that\u2019s going to go out of business without that funding .\u201d \n \nZTE asked backers to provide their feedback and tell the company what would they want to see packed inside a high-end Hawkeye smartphone. \n \nThe good news is ZTE has already committing to at least adding a high-end spec to the phone, but it will be interesting to see what the phone's specs list will look like in the end.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Wireless industry news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Handhelds news","group":"Technology"},{"name":"Telecom news","group":"Technology"}],"title":"ZTE Hawkeye Smartphone Could Become High-end, Kickstarter Page to Be Pulled Down","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"RO","country":"Romania"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Softpedia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658046","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"424"},"name":"Softpedia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["InformationTechnology","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.softpedia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mobilesyrup.com/2017/01/28/zte-hawkeye-specs-changing/"],"sequenceId":"695195826223","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:19:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/fitted/340x180/zte-hawkeye-smartphone-could-become-high-end-kickstarter-page-to-be-pulled-down.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Through concise incisive passing, Delhi Waveriders started breaking down the Ranchi Rays' defence each time they launched a counter. \n\nThe first chance fell to Talwinder Singh with a fierce reverse hit to fire in the opener in the 3rd minute of the match. \n\nTyler Lovell, in the Ranchi Rays goal came off the line quickly and blocked the shot to deny the visitors a lead. \n\nThe pressure paid off soon enough though. Mandeep Singh won Delhi Waveriders their first PC of the game, thanks to sloppy defence within the circle by Ranchi Rays. \n\nFrom the flick, Austin Smith, did not disappoint with a hard push, but could not beat the goalkeeper as the two teams went into the first break in a stalemate. \n\nDelhi Waveriders showed their resilience, coming back from the two-minute break, discomforting Ranchi Rays who made as many as seven circle penetrations but in vain. \n\nThe home team though had a golden chance at converting, within a minute into the second quarter, but Gurbaj Singh's deflection from within the circle missed the goal by inches. \n\nThe second quarter too remained goal less. It seemed as though fortunes would change in the third quarter when Delhi Waveriders' Simon Child appealed for a high-ball coming off Gurbaj Singh's stick within the striking circle through video referral. \n\nHis appeal was upheld and the visitors were handed a penalty corner. This time, skipper Rupinder Pal Singh taking the strike but Ranchi Rays goalkeeper Lovell was on top of his game so was the Ranchi Rays defender Flynn Ogilvie with some superb stick work to ensure they denied Delhi Waveriders a lead. \n\nThe battle for supremacy continued into the final quarter with both teams pressing hard and chances flying both ways. \n\nRanchi Rays missed a sure shot winner when Gurbaj Singh passing wide off Ashley Jackson who had positioned himself perfectly to deflect the ball into the goal. \n\nThe teams had to settle with a draw and split the points from the encounter.. \n\nSource","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"HIL 2017: Delhi Waveriders hold Ranchi Rays 0-0","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"India4u.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169984930","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"India4u.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.india4u.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195826427","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The win gives the Coyotes (15-9, 6-3 Summit) sole possession of second place in the Summit League standings. It also gives South Dakota its first regular season sweep of Denver in four years as conference foes. \n \nJoe Rosga\u2019s 20 points led five Pioneers who scored in double figures. The top shooting and best rebounding team in the Summit, Denver shot 51 percent from the field and had a 40-26 edge on the boards, but 18 turnovers led to 21 points for the Coyotes. \n \nMooney and Flack combined to make 17 of 29 shots for the Coyotes. It was the third-highest tally of the season for Mooney, who is averaging 21 a game in Summit play. Flack, back after missing seven games with a leg injury, showed no signs of rust offensively. He scored eight points in the first half in nine minutes of action and added 11 points in the second. His alley-oop dunk off a set play gave USD a 73-70 lead with 6:44 to play. \n \n\u201cIt was good to have Flack back,\u201d said USD head coach Craig Smith. \u201cThe guys did a good job of getting him in a flow and helping him out.\u201d \n \nMuch like the first game in Denver back on Jan. 4, this game was close throughout. The two teams combined for 16 ties and 16 lead changes. The difference was a 12-4 South Dakota run to close the game that spanned the final four-plus minutes. That came after Denver took its largest lead of the game at 79-76. \n \n\u201cNeither team could stop the other team for a long time,\u201d said Smith. \u201cCredit our guys. They made so many plays down the stretch. And the key was, once we took off the press the last 11 possessions, they only scored four points. Defense has been our calling card all year and that\u2019s what got it done late.\u201d \n \nMooney started the run with a layup, but perhaps the play of the game came when Tyler Hagedorn stole the ball defensively, started a 3-on-1 break, and pitched to Triston Simpson who scored, was fouled, and completed the three-point play to put the Yotes back in front 81-79 with 3:29 to go. \n \nNeither team scored again until Mooney drove for two with a minute left to push the lead to 83-79. Rosga missed on the other end and Carlton Hurst rebounded defensively and was fouled. Hurst made both foul shots and later made two more with 28 seconds left that put USD ahead 87-81. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m sure glad we were at home, because I thought our fans really willed us again down the stretch,\u201d said Smith.  \n \nNeither team shot great from beyond the arc, but fouls and free-throw shooting were certainly a factor. The Coyotes made 27 of 37 while the Pioneers made 23 of 29 from the line. \n \nIn addition to Rosga, Denver got 13 points from Daniel Amigo, 12 each from C.J. Bobbitt and Christian Mackey, and 11 from Thomas Neff. The Pioneers lost for just the second time in their last six games. \n \nThe Coyotes also placed five in double figures. Hurst, thanks to an 8-for-8 performance at the line, had 11 points. Trey Burch-Manning had 10 points as did Tyler Peterson, who added two assists and two steals in 16 minutes off the bench. \n \nSouth Dakota improved to 11-1 at home, but enters its most grueling road trip of the Summit season starting Wednesday at Omaha. The Coyotes will play five of seven on the road in February to finish the regular season. \n\nCourtesy: USD \n  Sports  College  {{Title}}  Remove        \nNews \n  \nGeneral \n   \nCourts \n   \nWeb Only \n   \nCrime \n   \nOutdoors \n   \nEvents Center \n   \nNon-Homepage \n   \nBoredom Busters \n   \nPipeline \n   \nPositively KELOLAND \n   \nTechnology \n   \nHunger \n   \nAffordable Care Act \n   \nShops \n   \nFlooding \n   \nRemembering 9/11 \n   \nDrought \n   \nJazzFest \n   \nSpring Storm \n   \nHonor Flight \n   \nSpencer Anniversary \n   \nCopper Lounge Collapse \n    \nDoApp \n  \nHealth News \n   \nBusiness News \n   \nSports \n    \nAgriculture \n  \nMarkets \n   \nLivestock \n   \nCrops \n   \nPolitics \n    \nHealthBeat \n  \nCancer \n   \nChildren's Health \n   \nHeart Health \n   \nWellness & Nutrition \n   \nGeneral \n   \nHealth Beat \n   \nWomen's Health \n   \nRX Resources \n   \nWhat's Going Around \n   \nOTC \n   \nDiabetes \n   \nRecalls \n   \nDental Health \n   \nMen's Health \n    \nPolitics \n  \nSouth Dakota \n   \nLegislature \n   \nBudget \n   \nCongress \n   \nTaxes \n   \nGeneral \n   \nLocal \n   \nCampaign \n   \nPresident \n   \nUS Senate \n   \nNew Laws \n   \nUS House \n   \nIowa \n   \nBallot Issues \n   \nLocal Races \n   \nMinnesota \n   \nGubernatorial \n    \nEducation \n  \nFunding \n   \nCollege \n   \nElementary \n   \nHigh School \n   \nPre K \n   \nSchool Supplies \n   \nMiddle School \n    \nSports \n  \nProfessional \n   \nCollege \n   \nHigh School \n   \nSports Zone \n   \nHeadlines \n   \nSummit League Tournament \n   \nOlympics \n   \nSuper Bowl \n    \nBusiness \n  \nIndustry \n   \nYour Money Matters \n   \nDevelopment \n   \nGas & Energy \n   \nLegislation \n   \nEconomy/Stocks \n   \nEmployment \n   \nGeneral \n   \nHealth Care \n   \nTechnology \n   \nEducation Funding \n   \nTourism \n   \nBanking/Finance \n   \nHousing \n   \nTransportation \n   \nInsurance \n   \nMeetings & Events \n   \nRetail & Restaurants \n   \nAll Industries \n   \nOn The Move \n   \nShops \n   \nAgriculture \n   \nHoliday Shopping \n    \nFeatured Stories \n  \nEye on KELOLAND \n   \nInside KELOLAND \n    \nWeather \n  \nSnow \n   \nForecast \n   \nRecords \n   \nRain \n   \nFlooding \n   \nDrought \n   \nWX Corner \n   \nGeneral \n    \nWorld News \n   \nInvestigates \n   \nSponsored \n    Done      \nDISCLAIMER: The views of the author are not necessarily those of this station, its owners, officers, agents or employees.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"MBK: Coyotes Prevail Against Denver","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Fayette","zipCode":"40505","state":"Kentucky","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Lexington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KELOLAND TV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659312","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"189"},"name":"KELOLAND TV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://keloland.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195826598","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:54Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There were up to 13 people detained or turned away at Sea-Tac due to the executive order, among others at airports across the U.S., according to reports. \n \nProtesters began gathering at the airport around 5 p.m. Saturday, converging at the south end of the arrivals terminal. By 9 p.m., estimates placed the crowd at over 1,000, and they were able to shut down some operations at the airport. \n More than 1,000 people are still at Seattle-Tacoma airport.

The Seattle Times reported that local resident Ibado Ahmed was at the airport to pick up her husband, who was coming to Seattle from Somalia. He was turned away and sent back to Germany, where his flight had originated from. \n\nPort of Seattle commissioners released a joint statement on Saturday expressing disapproval of Trump's order. The commissioners say the order was abrupt, and didn't leave room for preparation. \n\n\"As the operators of this airport, we are deeply concerned that the abrupt nature of the executive order did not allow adequate process for public agencies such as ourselves to provide service that travelers and families expect and deserve,\" the statement read. \"We took it upon ourselves to request a full briefing from Customs and Border Protection to understand how they are addressing this situation.  We respect these hard working federal employees who are under tremendous strain.  However, when we felt that traveler needs were not fully met, the Port of Seattle stepped up.

New equipment lets shutterbugs shoot from the skies and in 360 degrees all at once. \n \nAnd, smartphones \u2014 plus or minus a peripheral or two \u2014 have become the de facto device through which people chronicle their surroundings. \n \n\u201cThe number of people interested in photography keeps growing exponentially,\u201d said Sean MacDonald, owner of Everything Photography Store in Dubuque. \u201cNow everybody from 10-year-old kids with an iPod or an iPhone and Instagram can get into photography.\u201d \n SMARTPHONES  \nNate Roling works in sales at Everything Photography. The store sells and leases cameras, including digital single-lens reflex cameras, the preferred gear for professionals. \n \nWhile the market for DSLRs exists and likely will continue to do so, compact \u201cpoint-and-shoot\u201d digital cameras effectively have been killed off by smartphones, Roling said. \n \n\u201cBasically, the smartphone is people\u2019s camera now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything you were doing with your camera you are now doing with your smartphone.\u201d \n \nPopular smartphones like the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy series boast cameras with up to 12 megapixels. They have built-in filters and settings to adjust for low-light and no-light scenarios. \n \nIf that\u2019s not enough, smartphone photographers can supplement their devices\u2019 capabilities through add-ons, Roling said. Lenses can be clipped on to provide \u201cfish-eye\u201d effects, optical zooms or upclose \u201cmacro\u201d photos. \n \nSLRs have the edge in some respects, according to Roling. \n \n\u201cYou can\u2019t get some of the visual effects that you can from a full film camera,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shallow depth of field, historically, has been the domain of the SLRs.\u201d \n \nHowever, phone manufacturers are making strides in simulating some of those effects. \n \n\u201cProfessionals will always use professional cameras,\u201d Roling said. \n \nHowever, \u201cit\u2019s going to become a hobby, much like film photography has become.\u201d \n EYE IN THE SKY AND BEHIND YOU  \nConsumer drones with cameras have been around for years. However, as they get more advanced, they\u2019re becoming more operator-friendly. \n \n\u201cThe newest ones with GPS are almost dummy-proof,\u201d MacDonald said. \n \nRoling agreed. \n \n\u201cThey almost fly themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do fly themselves.\u201d \n \nSome models can be deployed and assigned to follow a specific target with a few button presses, Roling said. They can automatically fly around obstacles and avoid collisions without input from a pilot. \n \nVirtual reality is the newest frontier of photography. Cameras that capture images and video from 360 degrees are becoming more prominent and affordable. \n \nEarly models required photographers to \u201cstitch\u201d together footage from multiple camera angles to create the 360-degree effect, MacDonald said. Newer ones are doing that automatically. \n \n\u201cThe race is on to find one that is the most consumer-friendly,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one wants to stitch eight videos together in special software before they can view it in 360 degrees.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BEN JACOBSON \u2022 ben.jacobson@thmedia.com"},"topics":[],"title":"Camera tech makes professional effects the hobbyists' domain","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dubuque","zipCode":"52004","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dubuque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TH Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169695972","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2992"},"name":"TH Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195837189","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:01Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/telegraphherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/60/860344d9-61ca-544f-9e84-e94cd6f0025e/5887c2ea338cf.image.jpg?resize=300%2C207"}],"video":[]}}

It would have the same effect for residents who live outside Dubuque. \n \n\u201cWe talked. We said if we can collaborate, obviously that\u2019s in the best interest of the taxpayer,\u201d Henricks said. \u201cWe have a need for west side service and (a partnership) would be ideal. The next step is to determine the feasibility. Can this be done?\u201d \n \nRather than base cost projections on past usage, members of both library boards decided to conduct a survey to get a better picture. \n \nAbout 61,000 items annually are checked out from Carnegie-Stout by non-Dubuque residents, according to a report compiled by Henricks. About 21,000 items are checked out each year by Dubuque residents at the county library branch in Asbury. \n \nHenricks had estimated about 41,000 items a year would be checked out under such a partnership. But she felt that number could be high. \n \nOfficials from both library systems are working to determine the cost of running the program. \n \n\u201cWe just don\u2019t have a crystal ball,\u201d Henricks said. \u201cWe need to ask people, \u2018Will you use it? And how often do you think you\u2019ll use it?\u2019 From that we can get a more realistic idea of what our costs will be, and that will determine the level of participation in the partnership that we\u2019re going to have.\u201d \n \nDubuque County Library Director Michael Wright said the partnership would offer Dubuque County residents a wider selection of library materials. \n \n\u201cCarnegie-Stout has a much larger collection than we do, overall,\u201d Wright said. \u201cEven though we may have multiple copies of a title, they may be out. Or if it\u2019s a unique title, we might not have it while Carnegie-Stout may. It definitely offers our patrons access to a much larger collection. It offers advantages to both parties.\u201d \n \nThe five-question survey is available online through each library\u2019s website. Paper surveys also will be available at the county library, which also has branches in Epworth, Farley, Holy Cross and Peosta, and at Carnegie-Stout. \n \nThe survey is available through Feb. 28. \n \nHenricks expects to have results ready for review by early March. \n \n\u201cOur boards should be able to discuss this at their (March) meetings and then determine next steps,\u201d she said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"THOMAS J.

The officer was provided a $40,000 loan. \n \nOf that, $10,000 will be forgiven after five years and $10,000 was offered at no interest with a 20-year term. The remaining $20,000 is due on sale of the property, and also carries no interest. \n \n\u201cWhile participation in the program hasn\u2019t met expectations yet, it may in the future and is something we still need to work towards,\u201d said Chuck Harris, president of the North End Neighborhood Association. \u201cIt\u2019s still a positive to try to continue to push for and attain that goal where we want officers living everywhere in the city, not just on the periphery.\u201d \n \nA vast majority of the city\u2019s officers live on the south and west ends of Dubuque, according to police officials. \n \nTwo Dubuque firefighters have also expressed interest in the program, said Kris Neyen with the city\u2019s housing department. \n \nThe officer and firefighters declined to speak with the Telegraph Herald for this article. \n \nModeled after a federal initiative, city leaders hope to encourage a sense of safety and security downtown and increase investment and involvement in revitalizing the city\u2019s low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. \n \nProperties must be purchased in the city\u2019s downtown urban renewal district, which encompasses an area from 25th to Stafford to Bluff streets. People also must live in the homes at least five years after purchase. \n \nWhile not enough to entice veteran officers to sell existing homes, city officials hope the incentives will be attractive to new hires and first-time buyers, according to Mark Dalsing, the city\u2019s police chief. \n \nFire Chief Rick Steines said the department plans to use the program as a selling point in upcoming recruitment efforts. Information about the program is included as part of orientation for new officers, Dalsing said. \n \nHe said new officers have expressed \u201cinitial interest,\u201d but tend to delay purchases until after their first year, once they\u2019ve completed training and probation. Dalsing also noted that more younger Americans are choosing to rent rather than own homes. \n \nDubuque County Sheriff Joe Kennedy attributed low participation to the very thing city officials are attempting to combat that has kept others from investing in the area \u2014 crime. \n \n\u201cOfficers don\u2019t want to have to deal with work-related stuff when they\u2019re not at work,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to come home and have their vehicle be damaged because (someone) knows they\u2019re law enforcement \u2026 and people just don\u2019t want to have to deal with the hassle of living downtown when they can live on the West End, where there are fewer problems.\u201d \n \nDowntown Neighborhood Association President Joe Noll contends there have been fewer issues downtown over the past year, thanks to new lighting and city surveillance cameras that have helped deter problems. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some success with renovated apartments, and a lot more young professionals are living downtown,\u201d Noll said. \n \n\u201cBut, if we could get more city employees and law enforcement to own homes downtown, I think that would help foster a greater sense of pride, investment and security in that part of town.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"THOMAS J.

In the same way a mindset can impact behavior and appearance, so, too, can it affect the way someone fills a shopping cart. \n \nFor those lacking adequate emotional and social support, the act of purchasing is a wholly unique experience, according to a University of Iowa researcher. \n \n\u201cThe more we know about lonely people versus connected people, we can better design products that satisfy the needs of these lonely people,\u201d said Jing Wang, an associate professor of marketing. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty significant portion of the society.\u201d \n \nWang has published several papers on how lonely people spend their money. She\u2019s found that people with social deficits are more likely to purchase specific products. \n \nFor example, lonely shoppers tend to put more stock in the \u201cminority endorsement.\u201d If a product has received more negative reviews than positive, they\u2019re more likely to choose it based on the suggestion of the few. \n \n\u201cWhat we have found ... is lonely people would buy something that\u2019s a two-star (review) for their private use,\u201d Wang said. \n \nWang also found that loneliness is subjective. \n \nA person might have dozens of friends, but lacks the close emotional connections he or she needs to thrive. Conversely, another person might only associate with a few people regularly, but is completely content. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about how many relationships you have,\u201d Wang said. \u201cIt\u2019s about how meaningful are the relationships.\u201d \n \nShe said humans have two types of social needs. One is a sense of belonging; a social connection to the outside world. The second is deeper and more emotional. \n \nAn abundance of one can\u2019t replace a deficit in the other, Wang said. \n \n\u201cThese two types of needs cannot be replaced,\u201d she said. \n \nThese findings are relatively new to the marketing world, according to Wang. Previous research treated all relationships as essentially identical. \n \nBut Wang found that there are key differences. \n \nFor example, a recently widowed woman might stay active socially. But in those quiet moments at home, moments that had been reserved for spousal interactions, there\u2019s no easy substitute. \n \nDan LoBianco, executive director of Dubuque Main Street, said studies like Wang\u2019s are vital to business owners trying to meet customers\u2019 needs. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s no question, especially in today\u2019s retail environment, that it is crucial to collect as much information on consumer habits and desires as possible for our retail merchants,\u201d he said. \n \nWhile he wasn\u2019t familiar with the specifics of Wang\u2019s research, he is aware of multiple studies that suggest different shopping habits based on family status. He noted that for the lonely, an in-person interaction with a shopkeeper might be preferable to filling out an online order form. \n \n\u201cIf the consumer is looking for that interaction, both with fellow consumers and especially with store (staff) you definitely get that in the brick-and-mortar (stores),\u201d LoBianco said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"BEN JACOBSON ben.jacobson@thmedia.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Retail industry news","group":"Industry"}],"title":"Study: Some shoppers walk a lonely road, and that's OK","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dubuque","zipCode":"52004","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dubuque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TH Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169695972","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2992"},"name":"TH Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195838504","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:02Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/telegraphherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/b6/bb6c5888-74c5-5f86-98e0-6a82b403da12/588ba07418316.image.jpg?resize=300%2C897"}],"video":[]}}

If unsuccessful, the county will apply for possible state grant funding in June, Preston said. \n \nDubuque County also has been awarded $400,000 to replace the bridge between Gun Club and Fishpond roads near Epworth, requiring an $80,000 county match. \n \nPreston said he hopes to have the three bridges replaced this fall. \n \nA fourth bridge, west of Rupp Hollow Road, \u201chas a few more years left in it,\u201d but it is scheduled to be replaced within the next two years, depending on funding, he said. \n \nOther requests from the conservation board include: \n $50,000 to dredge the boat ramp at the John Deere Marsh and the Little Maquoketa River delta. The channel from the boat ramp to the Mississippi River has become impassable due to silt buildup. All dredge spoil would be trucked to an upland disposal site, Preston said.  $20,000 to add water access for canoeists and kayakers along the Little Maquoketa Water Trail, at Twin Springs Road, Budd Road, Herber Road and U.S. 52.   \nThe county supervisors praised Preston for holding down expenses and finding cost savings, while expanding offerings and use of county trails, parks and campgrounds. \n \nThe conservation board anticipates about $1.56 million in expenses in the next fiscal year, down more than $86,600 from projected expenses for the current fiscal year. \n \nRevenue for fiscal year 2018 is projected to be about $1 million, down about $30,000 from what is expected for fiscal 2017. \n \nMuch of that is tied to a smaller-than-anticipated fish habitat grant for Catfish Creek and adjusted revenue projections for the county-owned Fillmore Fairways Golf Course. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been budgeting $160,000 at Fillmore and have been hovering around $125,000 per year, and would bring that down to $140,000 to make it more realistic,\u201d Preston said. \n \nSupervisor Daryl Klein applauded Preston and the conservation board for keeping the golf course in the black. \n \nPreston anticipates the golf course will finish $4,000 above budgeted revenues by the end of the fiscal year. \n \nA public hearing on the county\u2019s full budget will be held Feb. 27.

Rod Blum, R-Iowa, last week spoke with the Telegraph Herald about actions taken by new U.S. President Donald J. Trump during his first few days in office. \n \nBlum said the U.S. would see \u201cimmediate payback\u201d from a wall separating the U.S. and Mexico, a campaign promise Trump supported through an executive order this month. \n \nSavings would come in the form of decreased spending on law enforcement, welfare, social service and education dollars spent on the estimated 11 million to 12 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S., Blum said. \n \nHowever, undocumented immigrants contribute more in payroll taxes than they will consume in public benefits, according to several state and federal studies. \n \nAccording to the Social Security Administration, unauthorized immigrants \u2014 who are not eligible to receive Social Security benefits \u2014 paid $13 billion in payroll taxes in 2010. They received only about $1 billion in benefit payments, attributable to unauthorized work. \n \nThe principal category of unauthorized immigrants who draw Social Security benefits include those who have overstayed visas or obtained Social Security numbers illegally. \n \nUndocumented immigrants also are not eligible for federal benefits such as Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Medicaid, Medicare and food stamps. Most of these programs require proof of legal immigration status under the 1996 federal welfare law. Even legal immigrants cannot receive these benefits until they have been in the U.S. more than five years. \n \nHowever, undocumented immigrants are eligible for schooling and emergency medical care. Native-born, U.S.-citizen children of immigrants are eligible for public benefits programs. \n \nA 2013 Heritage Foundation report found that, on average, households headed by undocumented immigrants in 2010 received about $24,721 in government services, such as public education, police and fire protection. \n \nBut in its 2013 \u201cImmigration Myths and Facts\u201d report, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said most economists see providing these benefits as an investment in the future, when these children will become workers and taxpayers. \n \nA 2013 Congressional Budget Office analysis of a failed bipartisan immigration reform bill found increasing legal immigration would generate more income and payroll tax revenue than would be spent on Medicaid, health insurance subsidies and other federal benefits. \n \nThe CBO estimated the 2013 bill would decrease the budget deficit by $180 billion over 10 years and by $990 billion over 20 years. \n \nYet, Blum argued, \u201cwhat we\u2019re going to save on welfare program and social services programs and law enforcement will more than pay for\u201d the estimated $12 billion to $15 billion needed to build the wall. \n \nBIVINS NAMED SPOKESPERSON, APPOINTED TO SENATE COMMITTEES \n \nIllinois State Sen. Tim Bivins , R-Dixon, will serve as spokesman for the Local Government Committee for the 100th Illinois General Assembly. \n \nBivins also was named to the Criminal Law, Government Reform, Human Services, Insurance and Veterans Affairs committees.

Our multiple layers of clothing would keep us cozy, but within days of that ride, warm temperatures would stop the pastime in its tracks. \n \nOne week later, Vaassen led a group up to Houghton, Mich., where 18 inches of snow fell. \n \nWe took two of the 20 or so snowmobiles stored in the shed, 10 of which are for children as young as 5 years old and top out at 15 mph. Our sleds were equipped with heated handlebars. The helmet could be plugged into the rig to prevent the face shield from fogging up. \n \n\u201cSnowmobiles have really come a long way, even in just the past 10 years or so,\u201d said Vaassen, 42. \u201cWe used to have to stop three or four times a day for gas while going 70 to 80 miles. Now we can go 100, 120 miles before gassing up.\u201d \n \nThe sport is more dependent on the weather than are the farmers who allow the riders on their land. Most snowmobile owners are resigned to spending much of their time on deeper snow during trips north. And the sport\u2019s reputation for staging \u201cpoker runs,\u201d where riders drive from bar to bar and get drunk, causes enthusiasts to bristle. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s been a thing over the years,\u201d said Roger Biefer, of Montfort, a snowmobiler for 47 of his 57 years and co-founder of the I-G Sno Cats Snowmobile Club. \u201cPeople think we go out, get drunk and throw beer cans and bottles all over the ground. That\u2019s not it. We have to respect the landowners\u2019 property.\u201d \n \nThere are about two dozen snowmobile clubs in the tri-state area. Wisconsin has half of them. Members of every club said their sport wouldn\u2019t exist without cooperative landowners. \n \n\u201cThey certainly don\u2019t have to let us do this,\u201d said Tiffany Saunders, of the Warren (Ill.) Winter Warriors. \u201cWe have the trails marked for a reason. There may sometimes be tree stumps you can\u2019t see under the snow, or new trees growing, or a creek or fence line you don\u2019t see. \n \n\u201cGoing off the trails could put you at risk of getting hurt and/or the landowner taking away the privilege so many of us enjoy.\u201d \n \nThe appreciation goes beyond just saying thanks. \n \n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have such an extensive trail without our landowners\u2019 lease agreements,\u201d said Wanda Pape, club secretary for the Dyersville (Iowa) DriftSkippers. \u201cRiding through their land allows us to connect our trails. Every year we have \u2014 as most clubs do \u2014 an appreciation supper for our landowners that offers them drinks and a meal and door prizes.\u201d \n \nThey also annually donate to organizations such as the Dyersville Fire Department and Dubuque County Firefighters Association. \n \nAbout six years ago, members of the Jackson County (Iowa) Snowmobilers approached landowner Tim Sprank for permission to go across his land near Springbrook. \n \n\u201cThey wanted more recreation for the county,\u201d Sprank said. \u201cAt first, I thought about whether there was anything they could wreck, and I wanted to make sure it was legal and that liability was covered.\u201d \n \nPapers were signed, and a half-mile extension for the trail that includes access to Cascade, Iowa, trails, as well as those in Clinton County, was groomed across Sprank\u2019s 90 acres. \n \n\u201cSome landowners just don\u2019t want people on their place, the snoopiness of it \u201c Sprank said. \u201cIt\u2019s the fear of the unknown. I\u2019m just amazed they can pull it off and connect all of the trails.\u201d \n \n\u201cEvery mile is a big thanks to the landowners,\u201d said club President Aaron Michels. \u201cWithout them, we would have none.\u201d \n FIRST RIDE  \nThat first ride of the season for our group from the Kieler club would be about 10 miles to Cuba City. Five minutes into it near Louisburg, we met up with Nick Leibfried, whose business, Nick\u2019s Powersports in Dickeyville, is a big booster for area clubs. \n \n\u201cHow\u2019s the trail?\u201d Brant asked as he took off his helmet. \n \n\u201cNot too bad,\u201d Leibfried said through his upraised face shield. \u201cCould be better.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe had some spots that weren\u2019t so good, but others were fine,\u201d Brant said. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s just nice to finally get out again,\u201d Vaassen chipped in, later saying they hadn\u2019t been out on that trail the past two winters because of lack of snow. \n \nAfter crossing Jimtown Road, one of eight roads we would carefully glide over during the trip, there was a trail sign that posted mileages to towns \u2014 Cuba City, 10; Hazel Green, 12; Kieler, 3. All along the route, signs put up by volunteers guided riders and warned them when to be cautious. \n \nAlmost immediately, the ride became bumpy. Several spots on the trail were exposed to the frozen remains of cornstalks. It felt like being on an ancient wooden roller-coaster, only on smaller inclines. \n \n\u201cThe ride would be 10 times more fun if there was more snow and the trail had been groomed,\u201d Vaassen said. \n \nIt would be that night. \n \nAll area clubs rely on members to keep the trails groomed and marked. \n \n\u201cNobody gets paid to go out and put signs up,\u201d said Josh Ruley, president of the Dyersville (Iowa) Driftskippers. \u201cIt\u2019s all volunteer.\u201d \n \nThat means a lot of work for The Snow Pioneers out of the Manchester, Iowa, area \u2014 they maintain about 260 miles of trail. \n \n\u201cThat includes putting in signs in the fall, removing the signs in spring and grooming trails in the winter when conditions allow,\u201d said club member Steve Vorwald. \n \nTheir system has some trails in Backbone State Park and in Delaware County. \n DRIVING RESPONSIBLY  \nArea enthusiasts acknowledge there are people who drink and then drive. But they insist it is not as common as people think. \n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t have anybody who drives stupid,\u201d said Cody Johnson, 26, president and organizer of the Galena (Ill.) Mississippi Ridge Runners. \u201cIt\u2019s the same as if you meet up with some of your buddies and go out to have a few. It\u2019s actually safer than drinking and driving (a car) because there\u2019s not as many people out on the trails.\u201d \n \nBiefer, who has served as vice president of the Grant County Snowmobile Association and was a Grant County representative to the Association of Wisconsin Snowmobile Clubs, said most riders have too much respect for the landowners to drive erratically. \n \n\u201cSome might drink, and some might not drink,\u201d he said. \u201c(The bars) are a warming place along the trails.\u201d \n \nVaassen agreed that there is more drunk driving on the roads than on the trails. \n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our members to take advantage of it and give the sport a bad name,\u201d he said. \n \nHis club annually joins the Dickeyville Idle Riders club on an area fun run fundraiser that includes a bus, where snowmobilers can pay $10 for a ride home. \n \nNate Johnson, of Dubuque, is a conservation officer with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. He has given out more citations to people who have been barred from driving motor vehicles of all kinds, as well as for outdated registrations, than he does for drunken driving. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re probably not detecting a fair amount of them,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely hard to detect someone who has been drinking while on a snowmobile.\u201d \n \nInstead, he occasionally approaches riders outside of a bar to remind them about the laws, which are identical to those for driving a car or a boat. \n \n\u201cBut for the past few years, once a year we find a sled that\u2019s been wrecked or abandoned off a trail,\u201d he said. \u201cOne owner set his on fire, apparently to try to hide any evidence of drinking.\u201d \n \nCraig Timmerman, 42, president of the Idle Riders, said the vast majority of their riders simply enjoy riding from town to town. \n \n\u201cAs a club, we are more about promoting the sport, camaraderie, scenery and the machines they drive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we promote the sport and educate the youth about the responsibilities that come with it.\u201d \n \nMany other clubs use fun runs as fundraisers. The Platteville (Wis.) Driftbusters might have the most unique fundraiser in the area. The annual one-day event on the last Saturday of January includes a radar run, open water race and cancer bikini run. \n \n\u201cWe were looking for a way to raise money and presented this idea to the club,\u201d said organizer Curt Timlin, 50. \u201cThey said, \u2018You guys are nuts!\u2019\u201d \n \nTimlin learned about the idea from a bartender during a 220-mile trip north to St. Germain, Wis., home to the Snowmobile Hall of Fame and Museum. He hosts the event outside his bar, The Barn. \n \nThe radar run measures the speed of snowmobiles over an eighth-mile track \u2014 the fastest has been 126 mph. The open water race has riders speed their sleds across 130 feet of water that is 4 to 5 feet deep. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to pull out a few,\u201d Timlin said. \n \nAnd then there is the bikini run, which has raised $15,000 for the Grant County Cancer Coalition in seven years. Area women wearing bikinis race their sleds against each other across an eighth-mile track. \n \n\u201cThe girls get pledges from area businesses and see who can raise the most and drive the fastest,\u201d Timlin said. \n \nThe event goes off regardless of the weather. \n \n\u201cFour of the last seven years we had no snow,\u201d he said. \n \nIn that case, club members have rallied around to haul snow in dump trucks from area parking lots, then using a new manure spreader to lay it out. \n SCENIC TRIP  \nOur snowmobile group flew as fast as 55 mph on some of the smoother stretches during the ride to Cuba City. Several streams looked like they were part of a painting, banked by the fresh white snow. Other views provided interesting perspectives. \n \n\u201cI like seeing the farms from the other side than you usually see them,\u201d Brant said. \n \nWe stopped near a stream about halfway to Cuba City to meet a few more riders: Ryan Ingersoll and his two sons, Zach, 16, and Austin, 14. Ryan\u2019s sled had sustained some damage under the skis while crossing a new bridge. \n \nThey teamed up to adjust the entrances to the bridge with some pieces of wood, and we moved on. After about 40 minutes, the Cuba City water tower came into view. We slowly drove a few blocks along the streets and reached Hindu\u2019s Corner Bar for lunch. \n \nSitting at the bar were longtime snowmobilers Carl and Dick Timmerman. They had already put 33 miles on their sleds during a trip from Kieler to Dickeyville to Cuba City and home to Hazel Green. Though not related, both Timmermans started snowmobiling in 1973. \n \n\u201cThere was very little suspension on those sleds and lots of breakdowns,\u201d said Carl, 72. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any hand-warmers, either. Now, mine\u2019s even got power steering.\u201d \n \nThey will go out anytime there is enough snow, whether it is in the area or up north, often with their wives. \n \n\u201cI like the fresh air and scenery,\u201d said Dick, 73. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a house-sitter.\u201d \n \nCarl once went on a 220-mile trip on trails near Copper Harbor in extreme northern Michigan. \n \n\u201cThat was a long day,\u201d he said, with a laugh. \u201cWe were a lot younger then.\u201d \n \nSteering snowmobiles is old hat for the young Ingersoll boys. \n \n\u201cWe live on a farm, so we\u2019re used to driving anything,\u201d Zach said. \u201cUp north on the lakes, you can easily go 100 miles per hour.\u201d \n \nAfter finishing off mostly hamburger baskets \u2014 Zach and Austin had cheese curds \u2014 we suited back up for the return trip.

Wood, 70, of Yuma, Ariz., slammed into the sport utility vehicle driven by McGhee and also carrying his wife, Alice, both of Asbury, Iowa, when McGhee turned in front of Wood on the Northwest Arterial at Plaza Drive. McGhee was cited with failure to yield upon making a left turn. \n \nThe McGhees credit Wood\u2019s quick thinking with saving their lives. \n \nBut a flashing yellow traffic signal played a role in a recent fatal crash as well. A Dubuque woman died when the vehicle in which she was riding turned on a flashing yellow in front of another oncoming vehicle Jan. 13 at the intersection of Northwest Arterial and Holliday Drive. \n \nIn light of the crashes, David and Alice McGhee would like the city to stop using flashing yellow turn arrows for turning lanes \u2014 a fairly recent addition to more than one dozen traffic signals around Dubuque. \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s no question about that,\u201d David said. \u201cWhen you see the green arrow, you know the oncoming traffic is stopped.\u201d \n New signals  \nThe City of Dubuque announced in September 2014 that it was adding flashing yellow left turn arrows to two intersections on Ninth Street. \n \nThe signal tells drivers in a turning lane to yield to oncoming traffic but allows them to turn when there is a gap. \n \nCity of Dubuque civil engineer Dave Ness said the city started adding the signals after the federal Department of Transportation made them standard practice. \n \nThe new signals have been phased in since 2014 to replace the solid round green lights that have signs above them warning drivers to yield before turning left. Ness said sometimes those lights caused crashes because drivers assumed the green meant they had right-of-way. \n \n\u201cWith the yellow flashing arrows, the biggest benefit we have with it is it\u2019s not green,\u201d Ness said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy to mistake for a protected (right-of-way with no oncoming traffic) turn.\u201d \n \nThirteen of the old solid green lights with left turn yield signs have been converted, with 46 more to go in the next few years. \n \nGary Meyer, owner of Gary Meyer Driving Academy, has been teaching new drivers for 40 years. While yellow lights urge caution and warn drivers to prepare to stop, many see them as an invitation to speed up to make it through an intersection, Meyer said. \n \n\u201cEven with my students in the driver\u2019s ed car, when they come up to that, some of them start to turn,\u201d he said. \n Recovery  \nThe September crash left both the McGhees and Wood badly injured. \n \nDavid and Alice McGhee were taken to University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics in Iowa City for treatment. \n \nAlice McGhee had a broken rib and cuts, and her arthritis pain intensified. David McGhee\u2019s injuries included a shattered ankle, fractured leg and pelvis, and six broken ribs. Both are back living with their daughter Brigid Rahlf in Asbury and are working on outpatient physical therapy. \n \nDavid McGhee said Wood was injured much worse than he and his wife. He said Wood swerved at the last second in an attempt to avoid their vehicle and struck a traffic pole. \n \n\u201cHe saved our lives,\u201d McGhee said. \n \nMcGhee said that, after the crash, he and his wife heard from multiple people who said they dislike the flashing yellow arrow intersections and want them changed. \n \nSome people said the lights are confusing, since they don\u2019t indicate the driver has the right-of-way, while a solid yellow arrow over a turning lane does mean the driver still has the right-of-way. \n \nRahlf also said they are a safety concern. \n \n\u201cI noticed them before the accident,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not elderly, and they still confused me.\u201d \n \nThe family doesn\u2019t think drivers have received enough education about the new signals and their meaning. \n Change?  \nTraffic engineers weigh a lot of factors when determining the most appropriate signals for intersections, Ness said. \n \nCity staff has fielded some calls from citizens complaining about the flashing arrows, he said. People complained that they felt uncomfortable at those intersections. \n \nNess said that is not necessarily a bad thing, as it compels drivers to pay more attention. \n \n\u201cSometimes in traffic the intersections where people feel really safe have more accidents,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get the ones, like some five-way intersections here, where it makes people pay more attention because they\u2019re uncomfortable.\u201d \n \nDubuque Police Department Lt. Scott Baxter said he did not have statistics for crashes involving flashing yellow arrows in the city. He said anecdotally that police have not noticed an uptick in crashes at those intersections since the signals\u2019 introduction. \n \n\u201cNot to downplay the seriousness of a serious injury or fatality crash, but one also has to look at the volume of traffic that passes through intersections that have flashing yellow arrows without incident,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking a tremendous volume of traffic that navigates the flashing yellow arrows safely.\u201d \n \nNess said when the new yellow flashing arrows were installed, the city considered adding signs telling drivers to yield, but state Department of Transportation officials said not conforming to the federal standards could create a liability issue. \n \nNess said a solid green arrow does give a driver full right-of-way and is appropriate at intersections with visibility issues or a lot of crashes. However, those also carry a safety risk where people are speeding up to make the turn before the arrow disappears to avoid waiting for the next cycle. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a balancing act of safety and efficiency and trying to get people to obey all of the controls,\u201d Ness said. \n \nAt present, the flashing yellow arrow \u201cobviously isn\u2019t working,\u201d Meyer said. He suggested alternatives, such as a flashing red light, or increased signage. \n \n\u201cI think education is the biggest thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really is.\u201d \n \nHowever, he noted that one recent traffic control addition to Dubuque \u2014 the roundabout at the intersection of North Grandview Avenue and Delhi and Grace streets \u2014 has worked out far better than he anticipated. \n \n\u201dChange is difficult,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cThat roundabout has worked way better than I ever thought it (would).\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"ALICIA YAGER alicia.yager@thmedia.com"},"topics":[],"title":"Couple involved in serious crash seeks change in traffic signals","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Dubuque","zipCode":"52004","state":"Iowa","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Dubuque","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"TH Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169695972","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2992"},"name":"TH Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195848871","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/telegraphherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/71/d71ec3b9-aa28-5e54-b94f-3c337c79262a/588d5770ee10c.image.jpg?resize=300%2C211"}],"video":[]}}

It\u2019s a mess,\u201d Obikili told AFP. \n \n\u201cAnd this will encourage illegal trade.\u201d \n \u2013 \u2018Killing business\u2019 \u2013  \nIt isn\u2019t just Benin which is hurting. \n \nNigerian car dealer Olabanji Akinola said he had to fire half of his employees last week as a result of the ban. \n \nBusiness used to be brisk at Akinola\u2019s car dealership, located on the outskirts of Lagos. \n \nYet now he can\u2019t pay any wages. \u201cIn Cotonou, they tax 35 percent of the value of an imported car. In Lagos, it\u2019s 70 percent\u201d, Akinola said. \u201cIt\u2019s killing the business.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe price of cars will go up, and the smuggling will increase. There are 200 roads through the bush to come to Nigeria, the borders are porous,\u201d Akinola said. \n \n\u201cThis morning, customers begged me on my knees to lower my prices, but I cannot,\u201d Akinola said. \n \nUltimately, it may only be the Nigerian government who benefits from the import ban. \n \nIn 2016, customs seized 307 contraband vehicles, worth nearly 5 billion naira (about 15 million euros).

Other key suggestions include measures to fast track NPA resolution, creation of a Central Corporate Repository and interest payment on CRR balance. \n \nBanks also felt interest subvention for farm loans should be parked with them in advance, as it takes 7-8 months for settlement of claims, leading to interest loss. \n \nThey also want the government to announce additional tax incentives for customers on term deposits, such as reduction in lock-in period for tax saver fixed deposits, and increase in tax exemption limit for interest income from term deposits. \n \nThe survey revealed that iron and steel, infrastructure and textiles continue to account for a large concentration of non-performing assets (NPAs). \n \nOverall, the number of banks reporting a rise in the level of NPAs is lower in the current round of the survey as against the preceding round. While 76 per cent of the participating banks reported a rise in the level of NPAs during July-December, 85 per cent had reported so for the preceding six month period. \n \nGoing forward, the key sectors identified by banks which could see a greater demand for long term credit include infrastructure, automobiles and food processing. \n \nThis is published unedited from the PTI feed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"Banking news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Banks eyeing big-ticket reforms in Budget: Survey","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"India.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597540856","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"India.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.india.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195857332","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:08Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:12Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://s3.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/indiacom-image-banner_03.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Photo: THT \n  \nKathmandu \n \nOn January 25 Nepal lost a music legend Panna Kaji Shakya. \n \nPanna Kaji was born on January 8, 1932 in Ombahal and raised there. He was interested in music since his childhood. His father Chatur Man Shakya used to sing bhajans and was an inspiration for the son to follow music. \n \n\u201cIn the beginning, he used to sing bhajans ,\u201d informed Prabesh Man Shakya, Panna Kaji\u2019s second son. The legacy of music has continued in the family with sons Prabesh and Pabitra Man having contributed to the Nepali music too. \u201cHis dedication to and passion for music led him to become one of the prominent singers of the country. He was so dedicated that he never missed reeyaz ,\u201d informed Prabesh Man. \n \nThe veteran singer-composer was 86 when he breathed his last at his residence in Tahachal. \u201cWe had just held his janku (a celebration performed when a person from Newar community reaches a certain age) just a month earlier,\u201d shared Prabesh Man. \n \nPanna Kaji is famous for Tiriri Murali Bajyo. He composed songs like Kina Kina Timro Tasbir, Lolaeka Ti Thula Timra Dui Najarle, Jati Heryo Uti Ramri, Hajur Lai Sumpeko Yo Dil Pani , among others. He sang over 300 songs. \n Life in theatre  \nPanna Kaji was not only involved in the musical industry. He was also well known for his acting. In the olden days when there were no female artistes in theatre, male actors used to perform the role of the females. In a play   Kunaal written and directed by Parmananda Bajracharya, Panna Kaji acted in the role of a female in 1947. \n \n\u201cThe play was a satire against the rulers in the country. The rulers should be one of the citizens. They should understand the problems of citizens rather than just being dictators. There used to be a dabali \u2014 where plays were staged. As the play was against the Rana rulers, only three shows were staged. Police came to catch the artistes,\u201d informed Pavitra Bajracharya, the eldest son of Parmananda. \n \nPanna Kaji had also acted in a Newari play Bisantar Ya Machadaan during the Rana Regime in the role of a king. This play was staged in public places and even in the royal palace, as per Prabesh Man. \n \nNot only a good actor and musician, Panna Kaji was a good friend sharing harmonious relationship with his friends such as Daya Ram Bhakta Mathema, Parmananda, among others. \n  \nPanna Kaji and his wife. Photo: THT \n  Musical journey  \nPanna Kaji went to Radio Nepal in 1951 and worked there in the library section. He was a great fan of Talat Mahmood \u2014 Indian non-classical and semi-classical singer. While working in Radio Nepal, he sang numerous songs. \u201cMore than 200 of his songs are there in its store. They aren\u2019t brought out,\u201d informed Prabesh Man. \n \nPanna Kaji used to sing live on radio. He had sung a duet \u2014 Manma Timro \u2014 with Dil Maya Khati. He also sang songs written by MBB Shah, Ratna Shumsher Thapa, Kamal Pradhan, Ramesh Bikal, Krishna Hari Baral, among others. Shiva Shankar, CK Rasaili, Nati Kaji et cetera have given music to his songs. \n \nHis musical albums The Legend of Panna Kaji Kasari Ma Birshu Unilai, Bhajan Kirtan Sadhak Gayak: Panna Kaji, an d Legends of Panna Kaji Aafno Sansar have also been released. \u201cI am also planning to release some of his unheard songs in a new album,\u201d revealed Prabesh Man who is taking care of all the \u2018musical properties\u2019 of Panna Kaji. \n  \nLyrics of MBB Shah written in his notebook by Panna Kaji. Photo: THT \n  \nPrabesh Man has preserved all notebooks of his father where the late musician had penned down the poems and lyrics given to him by lyricists. Showing one of the notebooks he added, \u201cThis is how my father stylistically wrote his name. I have never seen his name written in such a style.\u201d \n \nHe has also preserved discs that were recorded in Calcutta.  There is also a gramophone preserved in their home. Prabesh Man also has preserved a song Ma Suki Sakeko that hasn\u2019t been released anywhere yet. \u201cI am planning to release album(s) of my father\u2019s songs,\u201d Prabesh Man added. \n \nPrabesh Man is in music because of his father. \u201cWhen I sang father\u2019s Tiriri Murali Bajyo he appreciated it saying that I had sung it more openly than him,\u201d revealed Prabesh Man. \u201c\u2018You don\u2019t need to sing more songs, you need to sing quality songs\u2019, he used to tell me,\u201d he shared. \n Awards  \nFor his contribution to music Panna Kaji was conferred with various awards at different times of his life. He won the gold medal in Aadhunik Geet Gayan (1966). He was also the recipient of Gorakha Dakshin Baahu (Vth) in 1983; Subha Rajyabhishek Padak and Dirgha Sewa Padak were also conferred on him. \n \nWhen music legends Natikaji and Narayan Gopal passed away and their bodies were kept for final tributes for the public, Panna Kaji was quite frustrated at the scenario. Some people were passing time talking with one another, while some were laughing and talking at the condolence venue. He found the tribute to be more of a jatra than a condolence gathering. This is why he wanted his final rites to be performed away from the limelight. And as per his wish, Panna Kaji was cremated silently in Teku, Pachali. \n  \nPhoto: THT \n  Political career  \nMany people might not know about the political career of Panna Kaji. He was interested in politics and was involved in several political movements. He was arrested in 1962 for being involved in politics. Pavitra, whose father Parmananda was a contemporary of Panna Kaji, remembers the political life of these two people. \u201cThey were interested in politics as they were much influenced by the Nepal Praja Parishad \u2014 one of the political organisations in the country. They were involved in anti-Rana movements then,\u201d revealed Pavitra. \n Courageous in nature  \nPrabesh Man recalls his days with his father during the earthquake. During the April 25, 2015 earthquake, his father was in his room in their house in Ombahal. During the earthquake Panna Kaji stayed in his room even when his family members had already fled outside. \u201cWhen I came out of the building after the earthquake, I didn\u2019t see my father. When I asked others about father\u2019s whereabouts, they said he was still upstairs. I immediately went up. There he was, silently sitting. He was courageous and never afraid of natural disasters.

Our idea is to increase the share of MSME and affordable housing in the next 12-15 months time. \n \n\u201cAlso, our ticket size in MSME and housing is on the lower side. We want to increase the ticket size,\u201d Govind Singh, MD and CEO, Utkarsh Small Finance Bank told PTI. \n \nSingh said micro financing still remains one of the key components in the company\u2019s balance sheet and asset size growth will come from MSME and affordable housing sectors. \n \nCurrently, the average ticket size of MSME loan is around Rs 90,000, which the company would raise up to Rs 7-8 lakh going forward. \n \nFor affordable housing segment, the average ticket size of the loan will increase to Rs 25 lakh from current Rs 5-6 lakh, Singh said. \n \nHaving evolved from a non-banking finance company (NBFC) to an SFB now, Singh said the focus will be to create assets through deposit growth and gain more retail customers. \n \n\u201cFor a bank, it is more important to create assets. As an NBFC, we were getting money from various sources, banks and FIIs. Now going forward, our focus will be to increase our retail liabilities portfolio, create deposits. So our core focus is going to be on that retail liabilities to increase our base as a bank,\u201d Singh said. \n \nThe bank\u2019s big focus is on retail liabilities and all the branches are geared up for that from day one, he said, adding it will target the interior areas of the country. \n \nTo attract customers, the bank will offer deposit rates that are 1-1.25 percentage points higher than other banks. \n \n\u201cIn terms of balance sheet, I think by March 2018 we are looking around Rs 2,000 crore of overall deposits from public. \n \nand our asset size will be Rs 3,000-4,000 crore plus by that time and the rest (the difference) will come from borrowings,\u201d he said. \n \nSingh said Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, which cover almost one-third of the country\u2019s population, would drive business growth as it would target customers in these states. \n \nIn the last one year, Utkarsh has hired over 1,000 people and plans to recruit another 1,000 in the next 12 months as it opens more branches. \n \nThis is published unedited from the PTI feed.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Press Trust of India"},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Utkarsh Micro to focus on affordable housing, MSMEs: CEO","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"India.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"597540856","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"India.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.india.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195867865","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:12Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:19Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://s3.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/indiacom-image-banner_05.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But never had she had a weekend quite like the last one. \n \nKaren Chen, a 17-year-old, 4-foot-11 sprite from Fremont who trains under Gambill at Riverside Icetown, stunned the figure skating community by swiping the Ladies Senior gold at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Kansas City. \n \nThe next night, Vincent Zhou, a 16-year-old from Palo Alto via Icetown who won the national junior title three years ago as a 13-year-old, finished second in the Men\u2019s Senior competition to Nathan Chen, no relation to Karen. \n \nOne more level crossed off. It may have been just a matter of time. \n \n\u201cIt is a building process,\u201d said Gambill. \u201cI guess that just means we\u2019re on the right track. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s fun because now I\u2019ve had every national champion: Juvenile boy and girl, intermediate boy and girl, novice boy and girl, junior boy and girl, and now senior girl. Karen is my first senior champion, so that makes it special, that elusive senior title. And Vincent was very close.\u201d \n \nWhich would make her, um, an overnight success? \n \n\u201cExactly,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m an up-and-coming coach.\u201d \n \nGambill, a Redlands resident who declined to state her age but acknowledged her skaters now give her anniversary cards on her birthday \u2014 anniversaries of turning 39, get it? \u2014 grew up in the Sacramento area and was a good enough skater at 14 to leave home to train, much as her pupils now do. \n \nShe began coaching in Stockton 30 years ago. \n \n\u201cThe Oak Park Ice Arena,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThen I moved down to Southern California, and had two kids and started coaching down here. My son (Matt) is now 27, so it was 27 years ago that I started down here.\u201d \n \nHer first teaching gig in Southern California was in Palm Desert, at a long, skinny rink in the middle of the Town Center Mall \u2014 \u201ccalled a hot dog rink,\u201d she recalled. Her pupils there included Yorba Linda\u2019s Sandy Rucker and Indio\u2019s Dennis Phan; both went on to win age group national championships, Phan in 2003 and Rucker in 2005. \n \nShe later began commuting from Redlands to Anaheim three times a week to teach on a bigger ice surface, and also used the Ice Castle international training center in Lake Arrowhead when it was still open. \n \n \nAnd then Icetown opened, in 1997, an easier commute with no need to navigate mountain roads. \u201cPerfect,\u201d she said. \n \nThe accolades have accumulated over the years. Gambill was named the USOC Developmental Coach of the Year in 2005 \u2014 an honor that encompasses all sports \u2014 and has been similarly honored by U.S. Figure Skating and the Professional Skaters Association in 2005, 2012 and 2013. \n \nBut it\u2019s about her pupils, as it should be. She has coached world or national medalists Richard Dornbush, Shotaro Omori, Tyler Pierce and Caroline Zhang. \n \nFour of her skaters will be competing at either the world championships or world junior championships this year. Chen and Brendan Kerry of Australia will compete in the 2017 World Championships March 29-April 2 in Helsinki, Finland (and both will also compete in the Four Continents competition Feb. 15 in Gangneung, Korea, the site of next year\u2019s Olympic competition). \n \nMeanwhile, Zhou and Yarrick Paniot of the Ukraine will compete in the World Junior Championships beginning March 15 in Tapiei City, Taiwan. Zhou will also be the first alternate for the U.S. at the Worlds should there be an injury. \n \n\u201cI like it when they come in young and I can build them back up again,\u201d Gambill said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s fun to get some of the older ones. Yaro (Paniot) just came in a couple of weeks ago. He\u2019s super talented, so I\u2019m very excited to see what I can do with him as well.\u201d \n \nShe has around 20 skaters total, and her preference is to have everyone on the ice together. She barks orders \u2014 her own description \u2014 and, along with assistant coach Ryan Berning, gives technical guidance. She doesn\u2019t discourage the idea among her skaters that she has eyes in the back of her head, a fiction that works as long as she can see their reflections in the Plexiglas. \n \nAnd she listens as well as instructs. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve been with her for three years now, and I feel like I really do love her as a coach,\u201d Chen said. \u201cShe can be strict, but she\u2019s definitely very understanding as well. She listens to my opinion. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s always been something I struggled with in my interaction with my coach, but I feel like I\u2019m getting better. Sometimes if I\u2019m having a bad day or my knee\u2019s bothering me or something, it\u2019s hard for me to speak up and tell her, because I feel like I want to give my 100 percent in training and I don\u2019t want to let this affect anything ... (but) she\u2019s let me know this: It\u2019s important that if I\u2019m not feeling 100 percent today I need to let her know, so she can make adjustments to my training and it\u2019ll be beneficial for us both.\u201d \n \nChen is one of many skaters who have relocated from elsewhere specifically to train under Gambill.

Many organizations and groups have protested President Trump\u2019s decision to sign the executive order on Friday, temporarily barring immigrants (from seven Muslim countries) and refugees from entering the country. President Trump said that this particular order was designed to prohibit radical terrorists from entering the United States. But the decision also consequently puts a temporary blanket ban for any refugee trying to enter the United States of America. \n  \n\u201cI am heartbroken that today President Trump is closing the door on children, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war. I am heartbroken that America is turning its back on a proud history of welcoming refugees and immigrants \u2014 the people who helped build your country, ready to work hard in exchange for a fair chance at a new life.\u201d \n  \nMalala wrote that she was heartbroken for all Syrian refugees, specially the children, who had had to suffer through 6-years of war. She called the President\u2019s decision an act of discrimination. Malala also added the story of her friend, Zaynab, a refugee who fled 3 wars to come to the U.S. as a refugee at age 17. Zaynab learned English, graduated high school and is currently in college, studying to be a human rights lawyer. \n \nMalala ended her statement with a personal note to President Trump. \n  \n\u201cIn this time of uncertainty and unrest around the world, I ask President Trump not to turn his back on the world\u2019s most defenseless children and families.\u201d \n  Trump says that his latest order will prohibit radical terrorists from entering the country.

Malala who lives in Birmingham in the U.K. rose to prominence following her advocacy for human\u2019s rights and woman\u2019s education in her native Swat Valley in Pakistan, where the Taliban had banned girls from going to school.

A vocal critic of the President\u2019s decision to bar Muslim immigrants has been former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Albright, who came to the U.S. with her family as a refugee from Czechoslovakia in 1948, fleeing persecution by the Communist government, points out that \u201cby specifically targeting Muslim-majority countries for these immigration bans, and by expressing a clear preference for refugees who are religious minorities,\u201d there was no question that Trump\u2019s order was biased against Muslims. \n  \n\u201cAnd when one faith is targeted, it puts us all at risk.\u201d \n  President Donald Trump signed the controversial order on Friday, January 27.

There is nothing \u201cjunior\u201d or \u201clightweight\u201d about them. \n \nThe most interesting division in boxing hit another gear Saturday night at Fantasy Springs Casino. \n \nFrancisco Vargas, who had gotten a win and a draw in the 2015 and 2016 Fights of the Year, ran up against Miguel Berchelt, a fellow Mexican who was 30-1 but nobody\u2019s household name in America. \n \nAnd it seems Vargas has paid a high price for providing such violent entertainment. \n \nHis usual punching volume removed none of the spring in Berchelt\u2019s step. Neither did it stop his opponent\u2019s forward surges. \n \nWhen Berchelt powered Vargas against the ropes near the end of the 11th round and got little shrapnel in return, referee Raul Caiz Jr. stopped it at the 2:19 mark. \n \nBerchelt thus became the new WBC 130-pound champion and an intriguing new figure for the networks. \n \nFrom the beginning Vargas had difficulty coping with Berchelt\u2019s one-inch reach advantage and his two-handed power. Unlike Vargas\u2019 earlier victims, Berchelt was able to judge the distance and keep Vargas from rat-a-tat inside attacks. There was nothing resembling a knockdown, but Berchelt also held his poise and his command throughout. Between the ninth and 10th rounds, ring doctors spent a long time staring at Vargas\u2019 ravaged eye. Berchelt, standing and waiting to come in, began holding up his fist in anticipatory victory. The fight resumed, but nothing changed. \n \nIt was a surprising leap for a guy who never had fought for a title before and, in fact, never had seen a seventh round. \n \n\u201cVargas is a great champion, that\u2019s why he\u2019s had those Fights of the Year,\u201d Berchelt said later. \u201cI\u2019m young, I\u2019m hungry and I came here to be the world champion, and right now that feels great.\u201d \n \nThe outcome was not exactly a revelation for Vargas and his Golden Boy handlers. \n \n\u201cHe is his own worst enemy,\u201d said Eric Gomez, Oscar De La Hoya\u2019s right-hand man at Golden Boy. \u201cHe has a lot of skills as a boxer and a puncher, but he wants to fight these wars.\u201d \n \nGomez had likened Vargas to Salvador Sanchez, the great featherweight champ of the early 80s who died in a car wreck when he was only 23 and ready to become a celestial figure in the sport. Sanchez had the same charisma, in and out of the ring, but he also had the counterpunching polish necessary to put the head-first guys in their place. \n \nThat storyline vanished Saturday night, but another door opens and another compelling super-featherweight comes out. \n \nIf you could somehow clear out the politics (ha), you\u2019d see a procession of quality 130-pound matchups on a monthly basis. \n \n \nNobody in boxing is more polished and confident than Vasyl Lomachenko, and yet he lost his first professional fight to Orlando Salido, who brawled Varga to a draw at StubHub Center last June in what was the 2016 Fight of the Year. Then there\u2019s Gervonta Davis, the kid from Baltimore who dethroned Jose Pedraza earlier this month. \n \nThe only division on the same level is the 126-pound featherweight division, with Carl Frampton, Leo Santa Cruz, Oscar Valdez, Abner Mares and Lee Selby, among others. But several of those fellows will inevitably move up to 130, creating more permutations. \n \nIn the lead-in fight, Takashi Miura of Japan illustrated how stout Vargas is. The man who lost his 130-pound championship to Vargas in November of 2015 took consistent punishment from Miguel Roman, but kept moving forward until he had decked Roman three times and finished him in the 12th round. \n \nMiura, a southpaw who apparently has no nerve endings or anything resembling a pitch count, kept stalking Roman no matter how many fists he got in return. In the seventh round, Roman even knocked out Miura\u2019s mouthpiece. But a wicked left to the body sent Roman to the floor in the 9th round, and from there it was just a survival game. \n \nMiura thus raised his record to 31-3-2. He had only fought one round since he and Vargas staged the Fight of the Year two years ago, in which Miura nearly closed Vargas\u2019 eye and had the doctors wondering if the fight should be stopped. Then Vargas put that aside and knocked out Miura in Round 9. \n \nMaybe we\u2019ll see Miura-Berchelt, or Lomachenko-Salido, or Vargas against somebody a little less dangerous before he returns to championship mode. With his face an angry cherry pie, Vargas stood on the turnbuckle and waved goodbye. He\u2019ll be back, but the non-junior, non-lightweights won\u2019t waste time waiting.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Mark Whicker"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: boxing news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Boxer Miguel Berchelt becomes newest champ with confident TKO","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Los Angeles","zipCode":"91365","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Woodland Hills","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Los Angeles Daily News","feed":{"genre":"Opinion","tags":[],"id":"169679898","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"852"},"name":"Los Angeles Daily News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dailynews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195871867","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-28T08:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He doesn\u2019t represent the aristocracy.\u201d \n \nAnd he had fun along the way, inviting all of us to join him. Chrome has his own Facebook page. So do his fans. He also has a Twitter account. He has been sponsored by, among others, Breathe Right and Skechers. \n \n \nThis horse is so popular that it\u2019s almost as if people could line up for a turn to ride him, not unlike kids running the bases after an Angels game. \n \nAt this track, a ritual developed over the past three years that saw fans congregating in the early morning chill and darkness just for the chance to watch Chrome go through the most basic of workouts. \n \n\u201cThe world is holding onto Chrome,\u201d said Dr. Don Moore, a San Clemente chiropractor who works on the horse. \u201cHe is that Seabiscuit, that Secretariat. Everybody\u2019s just grabbing on. The country is circling around him.\u201d \n \nChrome made a celebrity out of Art Sherman, the now 79-year-old trainer who previously was a journeyman in this game. \n \nSherman, in fact, had to work part-time as a mutuel clerk during some of his barn\u2019s more desperate times. \n \nNow, everyone knows the trainer and the stories, like the one of how Sherman would rise most mornings at 4:45, drive to his barn here, walk over to Chrome\u2019s stall and feed him a cookie. \n \nOn Sherman\u2019s cell phone, he has pictures of his star doing everything from racing to lounging. He also has photos of Chrome awesomely rearing on his hind legs during otherwise simple trips to the track for training. \n \n\u201cHe can get wound up,\u201d Sherman explained recently. \u201cWhen he does, he\u2019s a lot of horse. That\u2019s just him feeling good out there. He\u2019s a stallion. He has other things on his mind sometimes.\u201d \n \nRacing, however, apparently never fades too far away for Chrome. Sherman\u2019s son and assistant, Alan, has the \u201cCall to Post\u201d bugle blast on his phone. Every time it\u2019s played, Chrome genuinely comes to attention. \n \nBut it\u2019s on to his second career now, Chrome scheduled to ship from Florida to the breeding shed at Taylor Made Farm in Kentucky. \n \nThe breeders last week posted photos on Twitter of the brass plate that will mark Chrome\u2019s new home. \n \nMeanwhile, his double-wide stall at Los Alamitos is now being occupied by Grade I winner Dortmund, who lost three times to Chrome in 2016 and a month ago was transferred to Sherman\u2019s barn. \n \n\u201cChrome has a big second career coming up,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cHe\u2019ll have a lot of good mares to mess around with. I just hope I\u2019m around to train some of his babies.\u201d \n \nImmediately after the race Saturday, not much was said among our group at Los Al. Most of the people walked away in silence. One fan, wearing a T-shirt that read, \u201cThis Guy Needs a Beer,\u201d just kept shaking his head. \n \nThe TV was positioned so that watching it meant facing out onto the track.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Monterey","zipCode":"93901","state":"California","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Salinas","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"5","name":"KSBW Channel.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659148","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"50"},"name":"KSBW Channel.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.ksbw.com/"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195875437","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:24:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:25Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://hips.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/traveler-released-at-jfk-airport-1485651543.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

The ever-increasing rate of electricity and water bills make it a task to maintain my monthly budget,\" Gandhi told IANS. \n \nPrem Jhakhar, another Delhi resident, said with inflation skyrocketing, the government needed to do something about the prices of essential goods. \n \n\"Apart from that, there is need to regulate the rising costs of education as well. The government should make education more affordable in private schools while simultaneously working on improving the quality of education in government schools in the long-term,\" she said. \n \nSwati Mantri, a research scholar from Noida, said more than the larger budget announcements, she was more concerned that her family needs would be fulfilled \"within her budget\". \n \n\"Vegetables, grocery, LPG should not get expensive. These mostly affect people with limited incomes. There should be relief for people on scholarships and smaller salaries,\" she said. \n \nGurugram resident Yashi hoped that the Finance Minister would announce higher interest rates on fixed deposits and incentives for gold investments for women. \n \n\"Our country's women are still not equipped with investment knowledge. Hence, they either believe in fixed deposits or in gold assets,\" Yashi said. \n \nSmita Kothari, a homemaker from Kolkata, said taxes on branded goods and meals in restaurants should be lowered. \n \n\"We like to travel once in a while as a family, but these trips are becoming more and more expensive. The government should also work on lowering travel costs as it will be great for middle class families and will also boost tourism,\" she said. \n \nAparna Singh, a Human Resource Manager from Delhi, said the government should formulate the budget keeping the middle class in mind. \n \n\"Most services and products that the middle class use are heavily taxed. The economically weaker sections don't use them and upper class sections are not bothered by it. It is the middle class that is worst hit,\" the HR Manager said, hoping that this year's budget will \"correct this imbalance\". \n \nAparna Isa Dass, who recently started her own cake baking venture Bakers High, wanted the government to work towards creating a stronger women workforce by working on employment policies that focus entirely on women. \n \n\"For women entrepreneurs, tax slabs should be further relaxed in order to encourage more businesses run entirely by women,\" she said. \n \nMany women were of the opinion that health expenses were a because of minimal government support. They expected the government to announce maternal benefits with an aim to ensure that women are not at a financial disadvantage. \n \n(IANS)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Health care industry news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Healthcare management news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Consumer: womens news","group":"Lifestyle"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"Budget expectations: Women seek cheaper essential goods, healthcare","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"BTVI.in","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"608171604","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"BTVI.in","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.btvi.in"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195880927","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2567","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Narellan","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Camden Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"345123874","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Camden Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.camdenadvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195885342","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:33Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Edwins Elementary School since Debra McElwy successfully dodged my follow-up gift to her Christmas present, Mr. Soapy bubble bath which came in a clown-shaped bottle that would give today\u2019s children nightmares and have me answering to DCF abuse charges. \n \nThat was 1965, and I was in fifth grade. I don\u2019t remember having such a hard time finding a parking spot. \n \nBut I am here today because it\u2019s Dad\u2019s Lunch Day and I am Auxiliary Dad No. 2 to Mr. Julian, Tracey\u2019s 10-year-old. I feel like I should be Auxiliary Granddad, and indeed, I am the only white-haired, pot-bellied codger in the line of dads stretching out the office. But I am an alumnus, dammit, so that should count for at least cuts in the milk line. \n \nI came prepared to be surprised. That\u2019s what happened when I visited Choctawhatchee High School about 15 years ago to speak to a class of young journalists about their futures and how they should focus on a career that would allow them to actually pay bills \u2014 oh and so people wouldn\u2019t accuse them of underestimating the size of the inauguration crowd. \n \nWhen I walked into Choctaw, I was surprised that I couldn\u2019t just walk in, which was perfectly acceptable in 1972. Osama bin Laden could have walked in carrying an atomic bomb and several plague-infected rats and nobody would have said anything, except maybe, \u201cHey man, cool rats.\u201d \n \nI was also surprised at how low the ceilings were. I could never have jabbed a pencil into the ceiling tiles in 1972, but now, if I wanted, I could lift the tile and hide a plague-infected rat inside. \n \nSo when I pulled into the Edwins parking lot, I was amazed to see that the playground and fields beyond were much LARGER than I remembered. I thought, \u201cThere\u2019s got to be an acre of property out here \u2014 and no condos. I\u2019ve got to take a picture of this.\u201d \n \nI checked in at the office and headed to the cafeteria. I was struck by two things: (a) The cafeteria was almost exactly like it was in 1965, except it was tiny. (b) Turnips. \n \nYes, it was on a day in this very cafeteria that I was so hungry I ate the turnips on my lunch tray \u2014 and I loved them. So everyone else gave me their turnips. \n \nThere was the stage up front where the firefighters gave their safety presentations and played the song \u201cSparky\u2019s a Fire Dog,\u201d which nobody to this day believes was an actual song but it WAS, dammit. Why won\u2019t anyone believe me? \n \nJulian came in wearing his faux Wayfarers and he was so cool-looking I at first didn\u2019t recognize him. But soon we were heading off down the ramp for the last block of classrooms and, as it turned out, the very classroom I sat in during the fifth grade way back in the year of our Ford Mustang. \n \nLunch was McDonald's \u2014 cheeseburgers, chicken nuggets and lots of fries, so many we ended up sharing them with the rest of the class (a practice I wish my co-workers would adopt). I got to meet Julian\u2019s teachers and his classmates, including one inquisitive boy who had a conversation with me: \n \nHim: \u201cAre you 49?\u201d \n \nMe: \u201cI wish.\u201d \n \nHim: \u201cHow old are you?\u201d \n \nMe: \u201cSixty-one.\u201d \n \nHim: \u201cYou look young. You look 49.\u201d \n \nMe: \u201cI\u2019m liking this. Tell me more.\u201d \n \nNuggets, gone. Burgers, gone. Fries, shared. I looked around the room before leaving. I can see why I thought it was so big way back in 1965 \u2014 because it was. \n \nBut now, as an Auxiliary Pot-Bellied Grandad, it was not so big physically. Just gigantic in my memories. \n \nContact online editor Del Stone Jr. at (850) 315-4433 or dstone@nwfdailynews.com.

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2567","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Narellan","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Camden Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"345123874","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"4"},"name":"Camden Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.camdenadvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195886581","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:32Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

It's scandalous and another deal that is counter to the public interest.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the troubled relationship between the NSW attorney-general and minister for police has been addressed, with Ms Berejiklian confirming a reshaping of the much maligned \"justice cluster\".\n\nThe arrangement, whereby as justice and police minister Mr Grant held a more senior position than then attorney-general Gabrielle Upton, was heavily criticised by the legal profession.\n\nThe NSW Bar Association said it provided Mr Grant \"with unprecedented power in determining legal policy without the historical checks and balances\".\n\nThe NSW Law Society warned the arrangement meant police were \"ostensibly responsible for criminal law policy, while at the same time, the traditional roles of the attorney-general as first law officer of the state, which includes preserving civil liberties, are being eroded\".\n\nMs Berejiklian has confirmed the cluster has been reworked so that new attorney-general Mark Speakman, SC, is the lead minister.

Source: Reuters  \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi delivered the 28th edition of \u2018Mann Ki Baat\u2019 today at 11 AM. This was PM Modi\u2019s first radio broadcast this year. Todays broadcast was specially for the students who are getting ready to appear for their board examinations in the month of March 2017 for which PM Modi he urged all the young children to listen to what he had to say today before the start of the show. \u2018Mann Ki Baat\u2019, a direct radio broadcast since October 3, 2014 that is addressed to the nation every month. \n \nOn Saturday, the Election Commission of India (EC) gave a green signal to PM Modi\u2019s Mann Ki Baat that was scheduled for January 29. The government had approached the Commission seeking clearance for the radio programme as Model Code of Conduct is in force in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur which are going to assembly polls between February 4 and March 8. \n \nPrime Minister Modi began the show by urging people to observe a silence of 2 minutes on morning of 30 Jan to pay respect to martyrs who gave their lives for the nation. He congratulated the families and personnel who won gallantry awards on Republic Day, He said, \u201cI urge youth to research on the martyrs by using internet and spread the word.\u201d He continued by paying condolence to the deceased and also remembers Mahatma Gandhi. He said, \u201cMy condolence to the brave jawans who lost their lives due to avalanche in Jammu and Kashmir. January 30 is the punya-tithi of our respected Bapu.\u201d \n \nYou may also like to watch- \n \nWhile talking about board examinations and the stress which is borne by the students, PM Modi said, \u201cWhy should exam time be a time of stress or sadness? Do not think about exams as pressure; they should be celebrated as festivals. Smile more and score more. During exams there should be an environment of festivity, it will turn P for pressure into P for pleasure. When you are relaxed, the recall value will be more. Relaxation is the best tonic for memory. A happy mind is the secret of a good mark sheet. Exams are not a benchmark of your success in life. If your mission and ambition are in sync, marks will follow. Take small breaks, return to books feeling fresh. Try deep breathing it is very relaxing. P for prepare and P for play, the person who plays, shines. Deep breathing is beneficial during exams, it\u2019ll keep you feeling fresh; Proper sleep will increase your concentration.\u201d \n \nHe gave the example of former President APJ Abdul Kalam and said, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t able to get into the forces but this did not hamper him, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have had a great man like him.\u201d While asking the students not to compete with others but to our own selves, he said, \u201cYou should compete with yourself to see how can tomorrow be made better than yesterday. Only studying for marks will lead to shortcuts and one will limit himself or herself; It\u2019s important to study for knowledge.\u201d To make this more understandable he gave the example of cricket ledgend Sachin Tendulkar , \u201cFor 20 years he kept breaking his own records hence getting better everytime. Root of problems are expectations, it is acceptance that makes things easy. Competing with others can make you unhappy and jealous. Compete with yourself and you will be energised & more determined to excel.\u201d \n \nHe even urged the parents of the students \u201cto accept rather than expect\u201d, he further said, \u201cOur expectations from our children should not get heavy. Parents\u2019 expectations are much heavier than the school bags of students.\u201d Cheating is never beneficial, no one must resort to it. If you do it what will you tell your children?\u201d \n \nPM Modi congratulated the Indian Coast Guards for completing 40 years on Feb 1, 2017. He said, \u201cI thank all jawans and officials for serving the nation. They not only look after coastal vigilance but also coastal cleanliness, as they under took a cleanliness drive last year. Not many know that our Coast Guard has women personnel also and they work at par with their counterparts.\u201d In the end he gave his best wishes to the students by saing that,\u201dBe confident, do well.

And (expletive) you too pay me.\u201d \n   \nAlthough he admitted he hadn\u2019t heard all of McGregor\u2019s words, White\u2019s pointed response was the most serious counter to the lightweight champ\u2019s brash form of self-promotion, which has frequently targeted the UFC as he\u2019s grown into one of its biggest stars. The executive didn\u2019t entirely take the bait, however, linking McGregor\u2019s statement to efforts to push an online product. \n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear all that,\u201d White said. \u201cHey, listen, when you\u2019re about to do a pay-per-view that you\u2019re charging people five bucks to listen to you talk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got to say some pretty crazy (expletive).\u201d \n \nAs the crazy idea of ever seeing Mayweather and McGregor in a ring, White shot that down, too. \n \n\u201cHere\u2019s what I think the chances are: About the same as me being the backup quarterback for (Tom) Brady on (Super Bowl) Sunday,\u201d he said. \n \nWhite previously made headlines when he offered Mayweather and McGregor $25 million each and a cut of pay-per-view profits to step into the squared circle. Mayweather dismissed the offer outright. \n \nSince that exchange, White said there\u2019d been no talks with the Mayweather camp and added his offer didn\u2019t signal a renewed interest in the bout. \n \n\u201c(I made an offer) because (Mayweather) was full of (expletive),\u201d White said. \u201cHe said he had made an offer, which wasn\u2019t true. So I made a real offer.\u201d \n \nIs there a chance, though, all the talk is just a prelude to a blockbuster? \n \n\u201cI\u2019ll be suiting up Sunday,\u201d White deadpanned. \n \nFor more on UFC on FOX 23 , check out the UFC Events section of MMAjunkie. \n  \nUFC on FOX 23 , Featured , Featured Videos , News , UFC , Videos \n  1.7k  shares","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Steven Marrocco"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dana White issues warning to Conor McGregor after Instagram outburst","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Grant","zipCode":"88061","state":"New Mexico","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Silver City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Silver City Sun-News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169715735","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"20"},"name":"Silver City Sun-News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.scsun-news.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mmajunkie.com/author/mmajunkiesteven","http://mmajunkie.com/author/justin-park","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/conor-mcgregor-boasts-5000-attendance-for-live-ppv-interview-and-declares-expletive-the-ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/2017/01/dana-white-offers-conor-mcgregor-and-floyd-mayweather-25-million-each-and-ppv-cut","http://mmajunkie.com/events/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/events","http://mmajunkie.com/tag/ufc-on-fox-23","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured","http://mmajunkie.com/category/featured-videos","http://mmajunkie.com/category/news","http://mmajunkie.com/category/ufc","http://mmajunkie.com/category/videos","http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG","https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/264420536/silvercity/sports","https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/264420536/silvercity/sports","https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/264420536/silvercity/sports,","https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/264420536/silvercity/sports","https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/264420536/silvercity/sports","https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/264420536/silvercity/sports"],"sequenceId":"695195890583","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:08:42Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636212444297671744-USP-MMA-UFC-196-WEIGH-INS-80234684.JPG"}],"video":[]}}

But the problem is that whenever there is a vacuum of information \u2013 as in the case of Buhari\u2019s health \u2013 pundits, rumormongers and analysts fill it up. \n \nThere is a school of thought that argues that the more information the public has, the more likely the polity would be heated up. For instance, if (God forbid) people find out that the president has a terminal ailment, and cannot function effectively nor even do a second term, he automatically becomes a lame duck leader. All the politicians being prosecuted for corruption would just buy time until he leaves. \n \nBut in trying to be economical with information, public officers could make statements that are incongruent with the spirit of democracy. \n \nTake Femi Adesina\u2019s recent statement. He says that nobody can force the president to speak if he doesn\u2019t want. In his thinking, the president had already told the country when he would return from his \u2018\u2019vacation\u2019\u2019 and that should be enough. \n \nSuch kind of statement should have no place in public conversations in a democracy. To the extent that the president was elected to serve Nigerians, Nigerians have the right to force him to speak on any issue. \n \nAnd here\u2019s where the problem is: there is a difference between a sick leave and mere vacation with some minor medical checkups in-between. \n \nIn the real sense, presidents don\u2019t get \u2018\u2019vacations\u2019\u2019. They receive security briefing and perform the job of commander in chief even while \u2018\u2019vacationing\u2019\u2019. In one occasion, President Reagan had to fire some striking officers while he was vacating in Camp David.  Obama took 189 vacation days. Did he handover to his vice during those vacations? \n \nIt is only when the president is on a sick leave that he could be exempted from addressing the nation. And in that case, could transfer power to the vice-president. In Buhari\u2019s case, he claims to have transferred power to his vice [which is laudable], not because he had to undergo a surgery, but because he wants to go on a vacation and undertake some minor checkups during the vacation. \n \nIn the U.S., for example, presidents transfer power to their vice-presidents by invoking the disability clause. And this clause is invoked anytime a president undergoes a major surgery and is sedated during the process. \n \nFor instance, in 2002, Bush transferred power to Dick Cheney for two hours. He returned to office after undertaking colon screening. \n \nIn 2007, President Bush transferred power to Dick Cheney when he had to undertake a routine colonoscopy. The procedure involved giving the president some anesthesia. \n \nIn 1985, President Reagan was the first to transfer power to his vice for 8 hours after invoking the disability clause when he had a surgery. He was criticized for not doing so when he went through surgery after he was shot in 1981. \n \nIn all these, Americans applauded their presidents for being open. But some American presidents had not been open. \n \nTake the case of Grover Cleveland. In 1893, Cleveland smuggled a surgeon onto a friend\u2019s yacht to remove a tumor from his mouth. Cleveland emerged from his \u2018\u2019vacation\u2019\u2019 a week later, and no one knew what happened. \n \nCleveland wasn\u2019t alone. In 1919, Woodrow Wilson had serious stroke while in office but kept it secret. His wife quietly took over \u2018running the country\u2019 till his term ended in 1921. \n \nThe question is this: could any president hide serious medical procedures as former American presidents did in this present world? In this digital world, it seems unlikely. \n \nMeanwhile, it was reassuring seeing our president in the company of Governmor Amosun and Daisy Danjuma in London. \n \nAbout the Author: \n \nEbuka Nwankwo is a Nigerian writer and columnist for TheCable News \n \n***Written pieces and contributions on this platform are the opinions of the writers only and do not represent the opinions of Tori.ng","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Nigeria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US politics news","group":"Society"}],"title":"The Difference Between Buhari\u2019s Vacation and Those of Some U.S Presidents","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Africa","subregion":"Western Africa","countryCode":"NG","country":"Nigeria"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"ForNaija.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"582875739","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"ForNaija.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.fornaija.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195890865","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:21Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:34Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

We just really ran out of gas. We just couldn\u2019t quite get the stop and you have to give Middle Tennessee credit. They are a good team and they got the ball inside for some good paint shots. They are a very good team and I thought we battled them hard.\u201d \n\nWithout the help of Jacobi Boykins, who was suspended for the contest, LA Tech faced an uphill battle against the Blue Raiders who entered the game undefeated in Conference USA play. Middle Tennessee controlled the game for the first ten minutes, but once the Bulldogs settled in, the scoring surge began. \n\nTrailing 17-12 with 11 minutes remaining in the first half, Louisiana Tech would score the next 16 points in the game and hold the Blue Raiders scoreless for a near-seven-minute stretch. \n\nThe run was capped off by a technical foul charged to Middle Tennessee head coach Kermit Davis and after two free throws from Jalen Harris, LA Tech held an 11-point lead at 28-17. \n\nThe technical foul brought the near-8,000 fans back into the action though, giving the Blue Raiders some life and triggering an 11-4 run to end the half. \n\nLA Tech would enter the locker room with a 32-28 lead over the first-place team in the league. \n\nAlready without one starter in Boykins, the Bulldogs suffered another tough blow as freshman DaQuan Bracey (\u201cDayDay\u201d) was forced to sit for a large chunk of the second half with cramps. Missing two starters, someone needed to step up and both Jy\u2019lan Washington and Jalen Harris answered the call. \n\nThe stat sheet won\u2019t show it, but Washington gave the Blue Raiders fits on the defensive side of the ball, while Jalen Harris helped fill the scoring void with 15 points. Those 15 points are the most by Harris in a conference game this season. \n\nHarris buried a corner-three with 12:08 remaining in the game to give the Bulldogs a one-point lead. Middle Tennessee wouldn\u2019t lead again until a three-pointer by Edward Simpson with 5:33 remaining gave them a three-point lead. \n\nWith a raucous crowd behind the Blue Raiders, Louisiana Tech needed an answer badly. Senior Erik McCree, like he\u2019s done so many times already this season, responded. McCree buried a three-pointer to knot things up at 57-57 with 3:43 on the clock. \n\nUnfortunately, Louisiana Tech would go scoreless for the next two minutes. \n\nThe Bulldogs were out of gas. \n\n\u201c[LA Tech] gave it everything they had,\u201d Konkol continued. \u201cWe have a very short bench and I told the guys that we have to come together and we have to find a way. We needed some guys to step up and we got really good contributions from several guys. They played very, very hard. We just didn\u2019t quite have enough at the end.\u201d \n\nThe Blue Raiders would outscore LA Tech 14-4 the rest of the way, padded by some late free throws. \n\nLouisiana Tech was led in scoring by McCree\u2019s 16 points. Along with Harris\u2019 15, Omar Sherman also added 10 points in the win. Seven separate Bulldogs joined in the scoring and all eight that played grabbed at least one rebound. \n\nThe losses to UAB and Middle Tennessee mark the first time this season that Louisiana Tech has dropped back-to-back games.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Middle Tennessee Too Much for Shorthanded Bulldogs","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Ouachita","zipCode":"71292","state":"Louisiana","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"West Monroe","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Myarklamiss.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"536893021","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Myarklamiss.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.myarklamiss.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195897457","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:30Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump. Velázquez and fellow New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler said they attempted to speak to Darweesh and Alshawi at JFK's Terminal 4 earlier Saturday but were denied. \n \n\"When Mr. Darweesh's attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked, 'Who is the person to talk to?' the CBP agents responded, 'Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump,'\" the court papers read. \n \nDoss, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, told CNN his clients knew they had to get to the US as soon as possible so they boarded the first flight they could. \n \nThe two men had been allowed to make phone calls. They do not know each other, and it is unclear if they were held together or separately, or if they were kept in a holding cell, according to Doss. \n \n\"Our courageous plaintiff and countless others risked their lives helping US service members in Iraq. Trump's order puts those who have helped us in harm's way by denying them the safe harbor they have been promised in the United States,\" said Karen Tumlin, the legal director of the NILC. \n \nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times. \n \nLegality questioned \n \nTrump's executive order, titled \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,\" makes good on his longtime campaign promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States. \n \nThe countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official. It also caps the total number of refugees admitted into the United States during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000. \n \n\"I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,\" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon. \"We don't want them here.\" \n \nAn administration official told CNN if a person has a valid visa to enter the US but is a citizen of one of the seven countries under the temporary travel ban, then the person cannot come into the US. If the person landed after the order was signed Friday afternoon, then the person would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship. \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people who were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. An official was not able to provide numbers of how many have already been detained. \n \nAfter the federal orders were issued, the department said it \"will continue to enforce all of the president's Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \n \n\"The president's Executive Orders remain in place-prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. \n \n\"The president's Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America's borders and national security.\" \n \nCNN's Kevin Bohn, Ellie Kaufman, Patricia Pedraza, Sheena Jones, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Rachel Crane, Chris Welch and Sarah Jorgensen contributed to this report.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US security news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Breaking News: Homeland Security to comply with orders not to deport travelers 1 MIN","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sebastian","zipCode":"72904","state":"Arkansas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Fort Smith","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"4029 TV","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659416","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"195"},"name":"4029 TV","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.4029tv.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195900853","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:38Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

This time it was a 63-53 loss to No. 23 South Carolina (17-4, 7-1 SEC) on Saturday at Mizzou Arena. \n \nMissouri (5-15, 0-8 SEC) finished the month 0-8 and on a 12-game losing streak. One more loss and the Tigers tie the school record for most consecutive in a season. The 13 straight conference losses dating back to last season ties a school record. \n \nYet if the Tigers are getting down on themselves, they haven't shown it. \n \n\"I think we're very close, at times in the game,\" center Russell Woods said. \"I believe the whole team plays hard we never try to give up we believe in each other each and every game, every practice and I believe each game we are right there.\" \n \nThings got off to a slow start as guard Jordan Geist's jumper and a Woods free throw were the only scoring for the first four minutes of the game. Missouri had a 7-0 lead when Sindarius Thornwell's 3 got the Gamecocks on the board at the 14:48 mark. \n \nSouth Carolina used that basket to start a 9-2 run and took the lead on a Justin McKie 3 with 11:33 left. Three lead changes and three different ties happened in the next six minutes, including a K.J. Walton dunk for Missouri to tie the game at 15. Hassani Gravett's jumper with three seconds left helped give South Carolina a 26-22 halftime lead. \n \nWoods, Geist and Walton were the only players to score for Missouri in the half. As a team the Tigers shot 7-of-21 in the first 20 minutes. \n \n\"I thought the first half, as we did the other night, we played extremely hard, I'm not going to say extremely well, I don't think it was a pretty half for either team,\" head coach Kim Anderson said. \"They made a couple of shots that were tough shots but I was pretty pleased with where we were at the halftime, we held them to 26 points. I was hoping we'd shoot the ball better in the second half but, obviously, we didn't.\" \n \nPuryear opened the scoring in the second half with a jumper, but South Carolina followed with a 9-0 run that included a 3 from Duane Notice. That run was stopped when guard Cullen VanLeer made Missouri's only 3 of the night. Missouri shot 1-of-17 from beyond the arc. \n \n\"The 1-for-17 from 3, they're the best 3-point defensive team in the league,\" Anderson said. \"And they've certainly padded that lead after tonight.\" \n \nSouth Carolina responded with a pair of 3's from Thornwell and P.J. Dozier to go up by 13 at the 10:10 mark for the Gamecocks' largest lead of the night. \n \nMissouri wouldn't go away, but also could not sustain any momentum. The closest the Tigers got the rest of the game was seven points. \n \n\"It's like the story of the season,\" Walton said. \"We'll go down and score and then we can't get a stop. I don't know we got to figure something out, but that was a big reason we lost the game.\" \n \nMissouri finished 20-of-56 from the field. The team's top four leaders in points per game \u2014 Puryear, Jordan Barnett, Tereence Phillips and Frankie Hughes \u2014 combined to score 13 points. Hughes did not see the floor Saturday. \n \n\"They make it really hard, you have to run a lot of ball screen stuff you have to run a lot of dribble stuff,\" Anderson said. \"It's hard to come down from guard to wing and make a play like you draw up. We knew coming in that would be tough. I thought both Jordan and Kevin had some looks and they didn't make them. \n \n\"It's been kind of the story of our season, we've got to get all the guys playing well together in one night or playing well together for two halves. It seems like one night one guys steps up and one night the next guy,\" \n \nRebounding played a factor in Missouri being unable to get a run going. South Carolina outrebounded Missouri 43-38, and 25-21 in the second half. \n \n\"Second half, I thought we just got beat on the boards,\" Anderson said. \"I know it doesn't statistically show up but I thought they had a lot of second balls and 50/50 balls. We have to get those, we can't give away possessions.\" \n \nWoods and Barnett led the Tigers with eight rebounds each.

My elder brother and I, both huge Nadal fans, had managed to get two passes to the match. And, yes, we did witness something that I am going to cherish my whole life. \n\nThe crowd seems to have been split into two equal factions \u2013 one supporting Nadal and the other Federer. After an exhilarating display of quality tennis, Nadal managed to beat Federer in that match. But Federer fans seemed hardly discouraged; one of them said: \"Koi baat nahi, apna banda jet-lagged tha (never mind, our man was jet-lagged)\". Pat came the reply from one who was part of the Nadal fan club: \"Haan, haan Nadal ke saamne hamesha jet-lagged hi rahta hai (yeah, yeah, he is always jet-lagged when pitted against Nadal).\" \n\nThe Federer-Nadal rivalry is rigourous, and involves a lot of adrenaline on both sides. But theirs is not unlike other greats in other sports: The hallmark of any competitive sport \u2013 actually good for the sport \u2013 is the comparison and undeniable rivalry between the two of its greatest players. The never-ending comparison between footballers Ronaldo and Messi, cricketers Tendulkar and Lara, Tennis stars Sampras and Agassi, and shuttlers Lin Dan and Lee Chong Wei \u2013 these are only a few examples. So, coming back to Nadal and Federer, when the two were again set for a clash in the 2017 Australian Open\u2019s men\u2019s final match, an involved debate over rivalry was imperative. Federer and Nadal overcome many odds to set up this Sunday\u2019s epic clash, the ninth meeting in a Grand Slam final for these living legends. \n\nOn the one hand is Roger Federer, 35, who had been out of action for six months due to injury. Seeded 17th, he has won 17 Grand Slam titles \u2014 more than any man in the history of the game. But he has not won any Grand Slam since 2012 Wimbledon. When he walks out into the arena, Federer will be the oldest man to appear in a Grand Slam final since Ken Rosewall, who was almost 40 when he took on Jimmy Connors in the 1974 US Open and lost. \n\nAnd on the other hand is Rafael Nadal, with injured knees, sore wrist and his once perfect forehand now lost. Seeded ninth in this tournament, he last won a slam in 2014, his record ninth French Open title. \n\nFederer says he is expecting an \"epic battle\" when he resumes the fight of his life against Rafael Nadal on Rod Laver Areana on Sunday. Few matches in the grand, sweeping history of tennis have commanded as much attention as this. \n\nFor many fans \u2013 myself included \u2013 who have seen this rivalry shape their emotional engagement with and understanding of the sport, it is enough that they will play each other again on the biggest stage. Two months ago, if you asked anyone to bet for a Federer-Nadal Australian Open final, you would have got answers like \"are you out of your mind\", \"they are way past their best\", \"are must be joking\", etc. But here they are again, the two famous, ageing titans of tennis. They haven\u2019t been fit, but they are suddenly at the top in the Australian Open. \n\nTheir journey to this final has not been easy. Each survived an epic five-set match in the semifinal. We cannot deny their luck when favourites Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic lost their respective matches in the early rounds. \n\nNadal who has dominated Federer in their head-to-head match-ups, has a 23-11 record overall and has won nine of their eleven matches in Grand Slams. Another exciting part of this match is that it is not happening in their respective dens. As we all know, Federer is the king of grass (Wimbledon) and Nadal is famously known as the king of clay (French Open). So, they are not in their own backyard as they playing on hard courts. \n\nWhoever wins, the match is going to be memorable. As fans, we must know that two of the greatest players of tennis are going to square off on Sunday. And it is going to be an amazing match.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Pratyush Raj"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"},{"name":"Sports: tennis news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Federer vs Nadal: The ageing titans set for an epic Australian Open battle","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Business Standard India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659514","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"218"},"name":"Business Standard India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.business-standard.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://mybs.in/2USkNOk"],"sequenceId":"695195906301","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:42Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2017-01/29/full/1485673987-1758.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

Across much of the Ozarks, they are causing significant damage to both private and public lands. The Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC), with help from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is working hard to remove these invasive pests from our landscape. \n \nIn a recent press release issued by MDC, Alan Leary, the Department's Wildlife Management Coordinator and leader of the Department's feral hog eradication efforts said, \"We made significant progress in 2016.\" \n \nMDC reported total of 5,358 feral hogs removed in 2016. That is a significant increase over the 3,649 reported in 2015. \n \n\"The key to eradicating these destructive, invasive pests is cooperation with private landowners and partners in efforts to report hog sightings, continue trapping and deter hog hunting and the illegal release of hogs. The majority of land in Missouri is privately owned, so it's crucial that we engage the public, educate them on the dangers of feral hogs and engage them in our trapping efforts. Through our communications campaign, more landowners are learning more about feral hogs, asking for help and ridding their property of this invasive species,\" Leary said \n \nTrapping is the best way to significantly impact hog populations, but it takes time and a lot of work. First, the large, corral-type traps must be built. Then they must be consistently baited for several days or weeks to attract the targeted group of hogs. You want to catch as many hogs as possible at once. To build the trust of the entire group at a bait site takes weeks. In order to ensure traps sites are left alone from hunter disturbance, the Conservation Commission prohibits hunting of feral hogs on all lands owned, leased, or managed by MDC. Meaning conservation areas, certain Army Corps lands and other public properties will now be off limits to hog hunting. \n \n\"Some hunters intentionally release feral hogs in new areas to establish populations to hunt and hunters usually only shoot one or two hogs out of the group, while the rest scatter across the landscape and become more difficult to catch,\" Leary said. \"Hunting actually compounds the problem.\" \n \nOn my property in Shannon County, I have been able to regularly capture images of hogs on my trail cameras. They have destroyed a beautiful creek bottom and are costing me a lot of money by eating the corn my feeders dispense for deer. I called the department and they came out and surveyed the damage. Now they are planning to trap the area. \n \nIf you have hogs damaging your land, you need to reach out to the department. They are taking the removal of feral hogs very seriously. The department, with the financial help of partners, has invested in state of the art trapping equipment to be set up and operated on both private and public land. \n \nAcross North America, feral hogs cause an estimated $1.5 billion dollars a year in damage, including $800 million in damage to farms. Hogs are voracious eaters, and can decimate an agricultural field overnight. They outcompete native wildlife for food. For example, a 200 lb. hog will eat five times as many pounds of acorns a day as a 200 lb. deer. It doesn't take many hogs to eliminate critical food sources for deer and other wildlife species. \n \n\"In the deep south, the battle is already lost. In Missouri, we still have a chance to stop the spread of feral hogs,\" said Parker Hall, an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service scientist with the USDA. \n \nSee you down the trail \n \nBrandon Butler, the executive director of the Conservation Federation of Missouri, is an outdoors columnist for Central Missouri Newspapers Inc.

The American Heart Association is the go-to campaign.\" While Exeter Hospital does not deliver \"high-risk\" newborns, McCallister said it has delivered newborns with heart defects, where staff was able to stabilize them and send them to another tertiary care center. \n \n\"I think the parents will be really receptive and appreciative of the hats,\" she said. \n \nThis is the second year that Wentworth-Douglass Hospital has participated. \n \n\"We're really excited to do it again this year,\" said Dawn Fernald, spokeswoman for Wentworth-Douglass. \"It brings awareness right from the time the baby is born. When parents are bringing this new baby home, right from the beginning they're keeping this in mind.\" \n \nDana St. Laurent, nurse manager of women and children, said the hospital delivers about 100 babies per month and they too have received their hats. At Wentworth-Douglass, pediatric cardiology is a full-time clinic, which is unique for a community hospital. If a heart defect is detected at birth, cardiology is right on site. \n \nIn addition to the handmade hat, new parents will receive information about congenital heart disease and the AHA\u2019s Support Network for families affected by heart disease and stroke. According to the American Heart Association, congenital heart diseases are structural problems with the heart present at birth. They result when a mishap occurs during heart development soon after conception and often before the mother is aware she is pregnant. Defects range in severity from simple problems, such as holes between chambers of the heart, to very severe malformations, such as complete absence of one or more chambers or valves. \n \nThe American Heart Association put a call out to knitting and crocheting enthusiasts and little red hats came pouring in from all over the state. They will be distributed to babies born at Alice Peck Day Memorial Hospital, Catholic Medical Center, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Exeter Hospital, Lakes Region General Hospital, Littleton Regional Healthcare, Memorial Hospital, Parkland Medical Center, Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, Speare Memorial Hospital and Wentworth-Douglass Hospital. \n \n\u201cThe Little Hats Big Hearts program provides information to parents during one of the most crucial times \u2013 following the birth of their child,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Eddinger, FACC, cardiologist at Catholic Medical Center. \u201cSince congenital heart diseases are the most common type of birth defect in the United States, we want as many parents as possible to be empowered with this information and resources when they leave the hospital.\u201d \n \nFor more about the Little Hats, Big Heart program in New Hampshire, visit www.heart.org/littlehatsbighearts.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Hadley Barndollar hbarndollar@seacoastonline.com @hbarndollar"},"topics":[{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Seacoast newborns will sport red hats for American Heart Month","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rockingham","zipCode":"03801","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portsmouth","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Seacoast Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169678066","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2297"},"name":"Seacoast Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://seacoastonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195911801","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Others may be slightly above strict income bracket limits of federal fuel assistance programs or receive some government help but not enough to get them through the winter. \n \nBoth community action partnerships work together to keep people warm during the cold New Hampshire winters. \n \nThe success of the 11-year-old campaign is largely dependent on local residents who have received assistance from the community action partnerships being willing to share their stories. A common thread among these neighbors and friends is their pride, which stands tall in the face of adversity. \n \nThose who come to community action programs for help vary widely in the life situations that brought them to ask for help. Most only asked for help when there were no other options. \n \nThe stories we highlighted often demonstrate one main point. Many of us are a job loss, death of a spouse or a medical illness away from a life-altering change of financial position. \n \nWe spoke to people who were scraping by when their furnace stopped working and they had no money to replace it. There were people who could not afford to fill their oil tanks, because they were single parents and had to choose their child\u2019s needs over buying oil. \n \nWe talked to a woman who was making a six-figure income when a debilitating medical condition resulted in her not being able to work and a woman who found the Community Action Partnership of Strafford County after putting her children in its Head Start program. When she needed fuel assistance, CAP of Strafford County was there. \n \nEach person who shared their story in the 2016-17 Gift of Warmth talked about their hesitation to ask for help, and then their great surprise and pleasure when they were compassionately treated by community action partnership staff. \n \n\u201cI was embarrassed, because I was raised, and I am raising my kids, that we take care of our problems,\u201d said Crystal Greenwood, who shared her story in this year\u2019s campaign. \u201cWe do and will continue to do that. But if life gets out of hand, please ask for help. The people at RCA are so graceful and they want us to come to them if they can help.\u201d \n \nGift of Warmth would simply not be viable without the generosity of community members willing to donate. And donate they have. Through 11 years, Gift of Warmth has now raised nearly $460,000. Donations are still being accepted. \n \nHow to help \n \nTax-deductible donations can be made by sending a check for any amount to Seacoast Media Group c/o Gift of Warmth, 111 New Hampshire Ave., Portsmouth, NH 03801. Please include which organization the donation is intended for: Rockingham Community Action or Community Action Partnership of Strafford County. \n \nTo apply for fuel assistance, call RCA at 431-2911. People experiencing any significant hardship and financial crisis can also call the number and they will be referred to the appropriate person. The main office is at 4 Cutts St. in Portsmouth.

Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, will reduce the originally proposed $3.6 million to $2 million, and will greatly simplify calculations and applications for aid. Bradley said it can also provide funds to farmers earlier in spring, \u201cassuring that they can feed their herds until the cows can eat grass again.\u201d \n \nThe high cost of cattle feed, coupled with falling federally regulated milk prices, sent 19 state dairy farmers out of the wholesale milk business last year and caused others to sell off many of their cows. Severe drought, especially in southeast New Hampshire, made it impossible for farmers to grow enough of their own feed and sent feed prices soaring. \n \nA stream of supporters, including legislators from the Senate and House, dairy farmers and others, testified at last week\u2019s Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing. Dissent was offered chiefly by representatives of Americans for Prosperity, who said public money should not be used to aid private businesses, and objected that this bill would aid one type of business but give no aid to others also affected by the drought. \n \nIn phone interviews, Seacoast senators, Martha Fuller Clark and Dan Innis, both members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, backed the aid provided by Senate Bill 10. \n \nFuller Clark, D-Portsmouth, who was also on the task force that initially studied the proposed bill and then its amendment, noted that unlike other private businesses, dairy farms cannot raise prices to cover their rising costs. \n \n\u201cThere is no doubt,\u201d she said, \u201cthat dairy farmers need help.\u201d \n \nWhile she believes the bill will be passed by the Senate, she urged dairy farmers to call or write their senators asking them to support it. \n \nInnis, R-New Castle, said he also supports the bill. He did not record a vote in committee, explaining that he was due to testify elsewhere. But had he been present, he said, he would have voted yes. \n \n\u201cOrdinarily, I don\u2019t support subsidies like this but this is something we ought to do,\u201d Innis said. \u201cThis is a special case. It stems from a natural disaster [drought].\u201d \n \nHe also believes the bill has a good chance of passing the Senate. \n \nDairy farmer Harold \u201cHal\u201d Bodmar III of Kensington is among those who have cut back operations. He sold 370 cows last year, leaving just 40 for him to feed this winter. He said he has seen three consecutive years of drought, with 2016 being the worst. Bodmar doesn\u2019t want to close the dairy farm created by his grandfather and also operated by his father, but he is exploring specialty products such as grass-fed beef, and is looking at other sales options. \n \nState Agriculture Commissioner Lorraine Merrill wrote during this summer\u2019s drought: \u201cCows don\u2019t like hot weather, and they respond by eating less and making less milk.\u201d She also reported severe crop losses among forage crops such as alfalfa, grass and corn. Merrill, whose family operates a dairy farm in Stratham, has recused herself from administering the aid. Should the bill pass, the Department of Agriculture would appoint a staff member for the task.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jane Reid"},"topics":[{"name":"Agriculture news","group":"Industry"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"},{"name":"US State Government news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US Federal Government news","group":"Society"}],"title":"NH Senate to take up bill to help dairy farmers","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rockingham","zipCode":"03801","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portsmouth","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Seacoast Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169678066","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2297"},"name":"Seacoast Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://seacoastonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195912479","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:44Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The bill seeks to have the state pay 15 percent of contributions of the retirement system for teachers, police and firefighters. It will now go to the House floor for a vote. \n \nThe state once contributed 35 percent to the retirement system for teachers and first responders, but the Legislature abolished the state\u2019s contribution in 2011, leaving towns and cities to pick up the cost. \n \nThe bill\u2019s main sponsor, Rep. Renny Cushing, D-Hampton, said the legislation is vital for municipalities, who each lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in aid from the state in 2011. Hampton received between $600,000 and $700,000 for teachers\u2019 and first responders\u2019 retirement each year from the state before aid was cut in 2011. Portsmouth received more than $1 million a year from the state in retirement contributions for teachers, police and fire. \n \nThe state began paying 35 percent of the retirement system cost for police, firefighters and teachers in 1977 when the Legislature and governor passed that fixed percentage into law. In 2009, the state lowered its commitment to 30 percent. Rep. Jackie Cilley, D-Barrington, was a state senator in 2009 and recalled Gov. John Lynch stating the decrease in contribution was meant to be temporary, as the state was struggling through the recession at the time. Cilley said the Legislature underwent massive turnover in 2010 and Republicans wiped out the state\u2019s contribution to the system the next year. \n \nCushing, along with other proponents of bringing back the state contribution, have said the state made a \u201cpromise\u201d in 1977 to contribute to the system and lawmakers went back on that promise six years ago. \n \n\u201cThe state had a role in supporting public education and public safety,\u201d Cushing said. \u201cIt made a promise to communities it would partner and support retirement costs for teachers\u2026 police and fire.\u201d \n \nCushing said he proposed the state contribute 15 percent because he believes that would be more likely to pass than a request for the state to return to 35 percent. A cost analysis provided by the New Hampshire Retirement System states the bill would have the state contribution increase by $40.81 million in fiscal year 2018, and that number would increase slightly in the following three years. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s a claw back in its attempt to hold the state accountable,\u201d Cushing said. \n \nOne of the committee members who voted against recommending the bill, Rep. Steven Beaudoin, R-Rochester, said he understood local taxpayers would benefit from the state contributing to the system. However, he believes the state should not be funding pensions for any town or city employees and questioned whether tax dollars raised from small towns should be used to pay for employee pensions in larger cities. \n \nBeaudoin also was concerned about where the money would come from, saying adding $40 million per year to the state\u2019s expenses is a \u201ctough nut to crack.\u201d \n \nCushing said no funds specifically have been identified to pay for the contribution, but he believes it should be the state\u2019s responsibility to pay that cost based on the Legislature\u2019s intent in 1977 to help fund pensions. \n \nCilley said the state demonstrated how much it valued reserving state dollars for the retirement system when it amended the state Constitution in 1984 to require money in the system solely be used for that purpose. At the time, she said, there was interest in raiding the funds for other uses. \n \n\u201cIf they want to do any one thing that will help the property taxpayers in this state, it\u2019s to go back to the promise they made to pay their contribution,\u201d Cilley said.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Max Sullivan msullivan@seacoastonline.com @MaxSullivanLive"},"topics":[{"name":"US State Government news","group":"Society"}],"title":"State retirement contribution bill heads to NH House","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rockingham","zipCode":"03801","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portsmouth","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Seacoast Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169678066","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2297"},"name":"Seacoast Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://seacoastonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195917736","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

This is a big area.\u201d \n \nSplaine wants the City Council to be proactive and address the problem \u201cbefore we get too far behind.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe stuff coming out of the bottom of the Jones Avenue landfill is going somewhere, it\u2019s got to go here because this is where it naturally would flow,\u201d Splaine said as he stood next to the creek. \u201cIn 50 years, 30 years as the sea level rises, it\u2019s going to start eroding even more of the Jones Avenue landfill, and when you look at the Jones Avenue landfill you see on the edges, on the sides, there\u2019s no capping at all.\u201d \n \nSplaine believes one way to address what he sees as a problem at the landfill is building some kind of berm that would start underground and serve as a barrier between the landfill and creek. \n \n\u201cWhen you talk about landfills, landfill caps are stupid technology, but it\u2019s the only technology short of picking it up and moving it,\u201d Splaine said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just dig it all up.\u201d \n \nBut landfill caps, Splaine contends, are essentially delaying the decay of the garbage and incinerator ash that was dumped in the landfill over the years. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s probably not decaying very much,\" he said. \"That is why what\u2019s on the edge is so important to control.\" \n \nSplaine recalls going to the dump as a child and throwing paint cans into the landfill with his father. \n \n\u201cThere were no restrictions,\u201d he said. \n \nSplaine previously opposed the expansion of the recreation uses outside of the 10-acre landfill on what is 50 acres owned by the city, which includes cross country trails where Portsmouth High School athletes sometimes train. But he stressed he now realizes those efforts are going forward. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Splaine said. \u201cI just want us to address the landfill.\u201d \n \nRoger Pittroff, who lives at the end of Jones Avenue, shares Splaine\u2019s concerns and pointed out several old tires that seemed to be buried in the ground outside of the landfill. \n \n\u201cYou\u2019ve got contaminants down here,\" Pittroff said. \"You need to clean it up.\" \n \nBoth men pointed to metal debris at the edge of Sagamore Creek, which they believe is leaching into the creek. That debris is referenced by city consultants Hoyle, Tanner Associates, which recommends the landfill site be cleaned up. But the 2007 report also says the site is \u201csecure, stable and well vegetated.\u201d \n \nDuring a phone interview this week, City Attorney Robert Sullivan and the city's environmental planner Peter Britz, said the city received a groundwater management zone permit from the N.H. Department of Environmental Services for the landfill and annual groundwater tests are done. \n \n\u201cI think things are pretty well controlled there,\u201d Britz said this week. \n \nIn addition to groundwater testing, there are three surface water sampling locations \u201calong the Sagamore Creek,\u201d Britz said. \n \nTests have been done for 1,4-dioxane, a carcinogen, since 2013, Britz said, but there have been no detections. \n \nIncinerator ash that was dumped there from Pease Air Force Base is enclosed in what Britz described as a \u201cbig baggie, essentially a liner under and over the ash.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe rest of the landfill has a clay cap, which is typically of landfills from that time,\u201d Britz said. \n \nSullivan said the landfill operated in two different eras, first as a municipal refuse site in the 1950s and then it received ash \u201cfrom the refuse to energy facility that was located at Pease,\u201d in the 1980s. \n \n\u201cMunicipal refuse was burned at the site and kept there in the 1950s using a so-called tepee, which was a primitive form of incinerator,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIt was a very large corrugated metal burning facility shaped like a tepee.\u201d \n \nTesting for PFCs, which closed the city\u2019s Haven well at Pease International Tradeport, and have become a major concern at the Coakley landfill in North Hampton and Greenland, have not yet been done at the Jones Avenue landfill, Sullivan said. \n \nCity Councilor Josh Denton stressed during an interview that there\u2019s \u201cno need for alarm\u201d about any issues at the landfill. But he too worries about the side of the landfill near Sagamore Creek and thinks more testing, including testing for PFCs, would be appropriate in the future. \n \n\u201cAs a layman, yes, I think it should be done given what\u2019s in there,\u201d Denton said. \n \nNear the end of a recent tour around the landfill, Splaine said the Jones Avenue location was likely chosen for a landfill site because \u201cit was out of the way and Jones Avenue was very loosely developed.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe question is how come we didn\u2019t start using this for recreation back in the 1930s,\u201d Splaine said. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful site.\u201d","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Jeff McMenemy jmcmenemy@seacoastonline.com @JeffreyMcMenemy"},"topics":[{"name":"Environment news","group":"Science"}],"title":"Portsmouth's Jones Avenue landfill raises concerns","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rockingham","zipCode":"03801","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portsmouth","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Seacoast Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169678066","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2297"},"name":"Seacoast Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://seacoastonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195917909","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Rep. Jackie Cilley, D-Barrington, filed House Bill 499 at the request of a 17-year-old Barrington resident and Dover High School senior, Cassandra Levesque. Not all agree on its merit. \n \nThe state\u2019s current law on marriage is broken into two parts: the age of consent to get married and the marriageable age. The current age of consent is 18 years old; the marriageable age is 13 for females and 14 for males with \u201cpermission\u201d from the state to marry, except for gay marriages. The gay marriage law that went into effect in January 2010 set the minimum age of 18 for same-sex couples with no special exceptions for anyone under 18. \n \nThe state\u2019s age of consent and marriageability has shifted over the years, though the age of consent to a marriage has been at least 16 since 1907, according to copies of the state law provided by Rep. David Bates, R-Windham, who opposes the bill. The current age of consent dates to 1973, which is 18 years for both sexes. From 1923 to 1973, it was 18 for females and 20 years old for men. From 1907 to 1923, it was 16 for females and 18 for males. Before 1907, there was only the age of consent, which was 13 years for females and 14 for males. Before 1891, it was 12 for females and 14 for males. \n \nLevesque, a Girl Scout, became interested in the subject after attending a workshop at the Scout\u2019s annual Senior Leadership Conference about human trafficking and forced child marriage presented by the United Nation Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF). Among its advocacy is eliminating marriage under the age of 18, which it calls \u201ca fundamental violation of human rights.\u201d \n \nUNICEF believes more than 700 million women alive today were married before their 18th birthday and about 250 million were married before the age of 15. UNICEF's central focus is in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, where the highest percentage of under 18 marriages occur, according to its data. \n \nUNICEF USA does not list any U.S. reporting of under 18 marriages on its website, stating there is no data available. However, the Tahirih Justice Center, a nonprofit that assists those trying to flee coercion and violence globally, estimates about 1,500 to 2,900 cases of \"known or suspected\" forced marriages around the U.S., according to a tabulation of a 2011 survey of various agencies around the country.  \n \nAfter the Scout conference, Levesque wanted to know about her home state. \u201cI was shocked and appalled,\u201d she said when she learned of the law. \u201cI wanted to get rid of it and make it more just.\u201d She contacted Cilley, who also said she was surprised at the age of marriageability. \n \n\u201cI was a little shocked that this was the floor of our marriage laws,\u201d she said. \n \nCilley learned that not only was there a law, but it\u2019s been used in modern times. While not common, she said according to the data she\u2019s received from the Secretary of State Division of Vital Records, there has been one instance of a 13-year-old, three cases of 16-year-olds and about 25 cases of 17-year-olds getting married in the state in the past five years. \n \n\u201cThere is no other type of contract that they could enter into legally. None,\u201d Cilley said. Not even getting a library card that's not under a parent or guardian, she said. \u201cAnd yet what many people consider one of our most solemn contracts that entails, literally, 1,168 different privileges, responsibilities and benefits, somebody at the age of 13 can enter into in the state of New Hampshire.\u201d \n \nWhile Cilley and Levesque expressed surprise at the law, Bates did not. \n \n\u201cMost people are shocked to learn that our current, long-standing law permits marriage by minors as young as 13 for females and 14 for males,\u201d Bates said. \u201cHowever, what seems to be missed or ignored is the fact that this provision only applies with the consent of the minor's parent or guardian and only if special cause exists, which needs to be demonstrated to the satisfaction of a judge before they receive permission from the court to conduct the marriage.\u201d \n \nBates sees \u201cspecial cause\u201d mainly as early teenage pregnancy, which he made clear he doesn\u2019t condone, nor does he advocate for early teenage marriage. He believes the reason the age of marriageability remained at 13 and 14 years old was because the state wanted to encourage the mother and father to remain together. \n \n\u201cThere was a time where there was a common belief that a child would be best served by growing up in a home with their natural mother and father,\u201d he said. \n \nBates urges caution on changing a law. If the Legislature is going to change a provision in the law that has been in place for 110 years, he said, it should at least make an effort to be fully informed about its history and the reason why it was enacted. \n \nCilley remains adamant that young teens should not be unable to enter into a marriage contract. \n \n\u201cThis bill simply says we believe as a society that 13, 14, 15, even 16 and 17 is too young to enter into a contract,\u201d she said. \n \nCilley urged action on increasing the age of marriageability to 16 years old this legislative session with an amendment that would create a study committee to look at when special exceptions are made. \u201cThe law is really not clear,\u201d she said. \n \nShe believed the study committee should also look at how the law between heterosexual and homosexual couples can be the same. Both Cilley and Bates agreed the current law includes language that is discriminatory and unconstitutional.  \n \nThe Children and Family Law Committee, which had a hearing on the bill last Tuesday, where Levesque, Cilley and Bates testified, will hold an executive session on the bill Tuesday, Jan. 31 at 10 a.m. in the Legislative Office Building in Concord, Room 2","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Brian Early bearly@seacoastonline.com"},"topics":[{"name":"US State Government news","group":"Society"}],"title":"NH House bill seeks to ban young teens from marrying","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rockingham","zipCode":"03801","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portsmouth","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Seacoast Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169678066","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2297"},"name":"Seacoast Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://seacoastonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195918096","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The business is divided between retail, services and workshops \u2013 all aimed at providing holistic approaches to healthy living. Chalifour says one of her passions in life is working with children. \n \n\u201cWhen I look out into the world, there\u2019s a lot of challenges that the future generation faces,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s staring us in the face right now.\u201d \n \nOne of those challenges is the heroin and opioid crisis, which Chalifour has a personal connection with. She said her niece was addicted to heroin, and Chalifour wants to do what she can to prevent others from going down that road, and to help those who are on the road to recovery. \n \n\u201cI began to think, \u2018What makes somebody turn to a drug or any other substance,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a need that you have to fill. But when you are able to realize that everything you need is inside of you, you will never need anything outside.\u201d \n \nChalifour hopes to use techniques like meditation and other methods of spiritual, mental and emotional healing to help people \u201cknow themselves and find inner happiness,\u201d so that they hopefully do not feel as much of a need to turn to outside sources. \n \n\"If we can offer some tools to help them and aid them in the process, I think that is very important,\" she said. \n \nChalifour lives in Dover with her husband and three children, ages 10, 11 and 16. The family moved to the Garrison City from Massachusetts in June 2015. She previously had a holistic center in Wakefield, Massachusetts, but the business lacked a retail space. \n \nShe said she is excited to offer workshops, massages, infrared spa treatments and other services, while being able to sell items at the \u201cOasis Retail Shoppe\u201d that will help customers achieve spiritual wellness at home. Retail items include herbs, essential oils, decorations and products to aid in meditation and wellness at home. \n \nApart from the retail space, Earth Harmony will feature two unique rooms \u2013 one called the Energy, Healing and Clearing room and one the Massage room. Each will feature Himalayan rock salt panels and a canvas mural. \n \nThe space also has an infrared sauna, which Chalifour said is healthier and more comfortable than normal heat saunas. \n \n\u201cIt heats from the inside out, so it does not feel as uncomfortably hot on the outside,\u201d she said. \u201cIt also helps improve circulation and detoxes the body because it focuses inside.\u201d \n \nHeaded upstairs to the meditation and healing space, there is a small altar Chalifour hopes will help clients find peace. She says her approach does not focus on one religion or belief, but instead emphasizes humanity as a whole. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to recognize that we\u2019re not separate in the world, but everybody is one,\u201d she said. \n \nChalifour said she became interested in holistic wellness when she worked at a chiropractic office and learned about the body's ability to heal itself. \n \n\"That really resonated with me,\" she said.  \n \nShe then began to learn about clinical herbalism and meditation and has been spreading the word about her approaches to wellness ever since. \n \n\"The medical establishment can be very effective with certain things,\" she said. \"But there is more to health than just physical health. Instead of treating symptoms, we look at how to heal the whole body.\" \n \nEarth Harmony will hold its grand opening Feb. 11 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. For more information, visit earthharmonywellness.com.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Nik Beimler nbeimler@seacoastonline.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"New Dover business to help fight opioid crisis","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rockingham","zipCode":"03801","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portsmouth","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Seacoast Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169678066","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2297"},"name":"Seacoast Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://seacoastonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195919752","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:45Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Blending together various organic ingredients such as vegetables, seeds and dairy to make a beverage can provide you with various nutrients without the hassle of cooking. \n \nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean you can just throw whatever ingredients you have into your blender and call it a smoothie. A smoothie requires careful research and experimentation to get the flavor and nutrients just right. \n \nThis recipe was submitted by James McLoughlin, co-founder of the Green Press in Australia. It uses kale and spinach as the base, giving the smoothie its distinctive green color. \n \nOther ingredients such as dates and pumpkin seeds add flavor, as well as their unique nutrients. All in all, this smoothie is one great way to chomp down on nutrients, especially if you\u2019re pressed for time. \n   \nIngredients \n  1 cup of organic kale  1 cup of organic spinach  1/2 cup of pumpkin seeds  3 dates  1/2 cup of ice  1 1/2 cups of organic coconut milk     \nProcedure: \n  Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend to desired consistency.    Kale Is a Superfood You May Not Have Heard About   \nKale is a dark, leafy vegetable related to the cabbage that has been dubbed as a superfood due to its nutritional density. There are many reasons why you should add kale to your diet. First, it has all the essential amino acids and nine non-essential acids for protein, totaling to 2 grams of protein per cup. Compared to meats, the protein in kale is easier to digest, which means that less energy is spent breaking down the food. \n \nYou\u2019ll be happy to know that kale also contains generous amounts of omega-3 , which can provide optimal health throughout your body. Along with this, it contains twice the daily recommended value of carotenoids, which are vitamins that can help provide healthy eyesight. \n  Spinach Adds Various Nutrients and Antioxidants Into the Smoothie   \nWe all know that Popeye eats spinach to make him stronger, but is this true when it comes to real life? Just like kale, spinach is also a leafy green vegetable. It\u2019s packed with vitamins A, C, E and K, as well as minerals such as magnesium, potassium, copper and manganese. It practically has everything you need to make your body grow big and strong, just like Popeye. \n \nSpinach contains specific flavonoids ( antioxidants ) that can help keep cholesterol from oxidizing in your body, especially in the colon. It also contains folate, a nutrient that can help maintain a healthy cardiovascular system. Studies have shown that spinach can help maintain a healthy brain and boost your memory and mental clarity. \n  Pumpkin Seeds Provide Health Benefits Without Affecting the Flavor   \nBlending seeds in a smoothie is a great way to add various health benefits without affecting the taste, and one of the best seeds you can use is pumpkin seeds. Just a quarter cup of pumpkin seeds can already provide half of the daily recommended value of magnesium. This mineral can help maintain healthy heart function, proper bone and tooth formation and regular bowel function. \n \nIn addition, pumpkin seeds have zinc, which provides a wealth of benefits, such as cell growth, insulin regulation and improved immune system function. Adding pumpkin seeds to your diet (or other zinc-rich foods) can help you ward off illnesses such as the common cold, flu, fatigue, depression and acne . \n  Coconut Milk Offers Essential Healthy Fats   \nBy now, you may have heard about the various benefits that come with eating or drinking coconut products. Similar to kale, coconut is a superfood because it contains various fatty acids that are known to provide various health benefits. \n \nThanks to its saturated fat content, coconut has been found to have a positive effect on your cardiovascular health. Consuming it regularly may increase your HDL (good) cholesterol levels, which can help lower your risk of heart disease. \n \nCoconut can be ideal for weight loss, too. It contains medium-chain triglycerides that help curb your appetite by making you feel full for longer periods of time. This helps reduce the amount of food you eat, allowing you to burn off the excess pounds easier, especially when this method is combined with proper exercise. \n \nLastly, coconut contains lauric acid. This acid contains antimicrobial properties that can help protect you from common bacterial and viral infections. Lauric acid can eliminate bacterial strains such as Staphylococcus aureus and yeast such as Candida albicans. \n  \nAbout the Author \n  \nJames McLaughlin is the co-founder of the health and wellness website Green Press .

Town Planning Director Dylan Smith said the number indicates to him that residents are at least willing to listen to individual proposals. Selectmen\u2019s Chairman Robert Palmer said he thinks it means people may not want to pay for such projects at all. \n \nThe survey asked a series of 15 questions about the direction the town should take with regard to energy. Almost 1,000 registered voters received the survey and 315 responded \u2013 roughly 32 percent. Three of the questions required a written response; the remaining 12 asked people to rank response from \u201cstrongly agree\u201d to \u201cstrongly disagree.\u201d \n \nIn nearly all of the tabulated responses, a vast majority indicated they agreed or strongly agreed to a series of statements, such as \u201cYork should expand our use of renewable energy such as a solar array on the York landfill,\u201d or build more energy efficient municipal buildings, or adopt energy efficient building codes. \n \n\u201cI think the answers are fairly decisive,\u201d said Rozanna Patane, chairwoman of the town\u2019s Energy Steering Committee \u201cIt says to me that these are issues the town is interested in.\u201d \n \nShe said she was particularly heartened by a couple of answers. Almost 93 percent of those responding said they believe York should reduce municipal vehicle emissions whenever cost-effective. She was reminded that voters turned down a capital item last May to purchase a hybrid vehicle. \n \n\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure how to proceed after that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this response says to me that we probably didn\u2019t support the question well enough. (Selectman) Dawn Watson said we should have included the benefits of a hybrid vehicle in the statement of fact. And she\u2019s right.\u201d \n \nAnother question asked about promoting environmental science and energy policy in the York School Department \u2013 with nearly 80 percent supporting such action. She said committee members have already reached out to the schools. \u201cWe would like to collaborate with them, and they\u2019re very interested in doing that,\" she said. \n \nThe response noticeably narrows when people are asked to respond to the statement: \u201cYork should invest municipal financial resources to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d Answers to the question were: 20.3 percent strongly agreed; 28.9 percent agreed; 17.1 percent didn\u2019t know/didn\u2019t have an opinion; 13 percent disagreed; 4.3 percent strongly disagreed. Another 14 percent didn\u2019t answer the question. \n \nAt a recent selectmen\u2019s meeting when the survey was discussed, Palmer described his response to that question this way: \u201cEveryone is for it, until they have to pay. Only 52 percent want to spend money.\u201d \n \nBut Smith said he has a different take. \u201cWhat it says to me is that people want to allow the debate to happen when the time comes. I think it all depends on the scale of the project. There is going to be a different debate when you\u2019re talking about a solar farm versus a couple of panels on Town Hall. But it\u2019s clear in a general way there\u2019s support to allow for that debate to occur.\u201d \n \nThe survey was conducted at the request of the Board of Selectmen after the Planning Board presented an energy chapter to the comprehensive plan last fall. Selectmen said they wanted to get a sense of community support before putting the chapter on the ballot right away. \n \nThere has been a persistent sense by some board members that the Energy Steering Committee has become too independent \u2013 a sense reiterated by Palmer and Town Manager Steve Burns at a selectmen\u2019s meeting early this month. \n \n\u201cThey should be an advisor on energy issues and not go off and do their own thing,\u201d Burns said. \u201cThey can come in and offer stuff, but you guys should be the ones to decide.\u201d \n \n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be leaders telling us what they want to do, which is what\u2019s happened,\u201d added Palmer. \n \nAt the same meeting, Jon Speers took a conciliatory tone, saying \u201cI would like a chance to hear from them about what they think is important. There should be give and take on both sides.\u201d \n \nSmith said the survey will be presented to the Planning Board, which will take it into consideration while drafting an energy chapter, likely for inclusion on the November ballot.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Deborah McDermott dmcdermott@seacoastonline.com @dmcdermoSMG"},"topics":[],"title":"Survey shows support for energy measures","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rockingham","zipCode":"03801","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portsmouth","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Seacoast Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169678066","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2297"},"name":"Seacoast Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://seacoastonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195920150","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:46Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Cushing, Lovejoy and McBeath. The bill would have established a marriage license that would temporarily authorize an individual to solemnize a marriage. A person could apply to the N.H. secretary of state, pay a fee, and be authorized to perform only a civil marriage specifically designated on the registration form. Most of the fee would be deposited in an already existing state fund for domestic violence programs.  \n \nThe Office of Secretary of State estimated 300 special licenses would be issued per year, resulting in $24,000 in revenue for funding domestic violence programs. \n \nThe House Judiciary Committee voted \u200b13 to 5 to recommending that the bill be defeated. Reporting for the committee recommendation, Rep. Wuelper wrote, \" This bill seeks to allow a new state license authorizing any individual to perform a single specified marriage for a fee of $90, with $80 of that going into the victim\u2019s assistance fund. The committee felt that charging over three times the amount called for judges or justices of the peace to perform the ceremony was excessive. Testimony indicated that town/city clerks might have serious problems certifying the completion of marriages if people from other states or countries failed to complete and return the paperwork.\" \n \nThe House voted 204 to 158 to kill the bill. \"Yes\" supported the motion to kill it, \"no\" opposed that motion:  \n \nHerald legislators \n \nYes: Abrami, Bean, Cahill, DiLorenzo, Emerick, Gilman, Richard Gordon, Janvrin, Khan, Henry Marsh, Nigrello \n \nNo: Altschiller, Berrien, Cali-Pitts, Cushing, Edgar, Farnham, Francese, Pamela Gordon, Le, Lovejoy, Malloy, McBeath, Messmer, Murray, Read, Somssich, Ward \n \nNot voting: Chase, Pantelakos, excused; Tilton, not excused \n \nFoster's legislators \n \nYes: Avellani, Beaudoin, Berube, Comeau, Cook, Gourgue, Graham, Horgan, Howard, Kaczynski, Maloney, William Marsh, McNally, Mullen, Nelson, Pitre, Sandler, Scruton, Turcotte, Varney, Woitkun, Wuelper \n \nNo: Bixby, Burton, Cilley, Ellis, Epstein, Fontneau, Frost, Grassie, Harrington, Horrigan, Keans, Krans, Opderbecke, Salloway, Schmidt, Smith, Southworth, Sprague, Stone, Treleaven, Vincent, Wall, Wallace \n \nNot voting: Dean-Bailey, Phinney, excused; Spang, not excused \n \nPublic hearing process - citizens vs. lobbyists \n \nHouse Rule 100 provides for duties of committees and committee procedure. Included are rules of process authorizing meeting notice requirements, quorums, and the methods of making and voting on motions of recommendation on individual bills heard at public hearings. \n \nRep. Timothy Smith, D-Manchester, offered a change to the rule that would encourage committees to allow citizens to speak before paid lobbyists at public hearings. The rule he wrote was \"to ensure on a best-effort basis that members of the public are recognized to testify at public hearings before individuals properly identified as lobbyists.\" \n \nHe pointed out that because of busy schedules, time may run out at public hearings before everyone wishing to speak can do so, and those not recognized to testify early may not be heard at all. Citizens who take a day off work to testify may not be heard. But a long-time committee chair opposed the new rule, saying the rule change could limit the committee from asking lobbyists to speak who may have important information to share. \n \nBefore the vote on the suggested new rule change, two legislators, one for passage and one against, were allowed to ask \"parliamentary questions,\" suggesting how legislators should vote. Those questions, a tradition in the legislature, often best sum up the issue just before a vote is taken. Those asking the question thereby recommend pressing the \"Green\" button on each legislator's' seat, which electronically is a vote for a motion, or the \"Red\" button, which casts a vote against the motion.  \n \nRep. Frost, supporting the rule change, asked \"If I know that this is the 'peoples' house' and not the 'lobbyists' house' would I now push the green button?\"  \n \nRep. Richard Hinch, R-Merrimack, asked, \"Mr. Speaker, if I have the utmost confidence in our leadership and our chairs and vice chairs regardless of political party over the years to have conducted the meetings in an orderly fashion, and if I believe also that the chairs are always cognizant of the rights of the public to speak and want to make sure that we want to hear from the public, do I now push the red button because this amendment is not necessary?\"  \n \nThe House voted 121 to 242 against the new rule. \"Yes\" favored the rule change, \"no\" opposed: \n \nHerald legislators \n \nYes: Altschiller, Cahill, Cushing, DiLorenzo, Edgar, Gilman, Le, Murray, Pantelakos, Read, Somssich, Ward \n \nNo: Abrami, Bean, Berrien, Cali-Pitts, Chase, Emerick, Francese, Pamela Gordon, Richard Gordon, Janvrin, Khan, Lovejoy, Malloy, Henry Marsh, McBeath, Messmer, Nigrello \n \nNot voting:  Farnham, Tilton \n \nFoster's legislators \n \nYes: Beaudoin, Bixby, Cilley, Comeau, Epstein, Frost, Grassie, Howard, Kaczynski, Keans, Maloney, Phinney, Salloway, Sandler, Treleaven, Wallace, Wuelper \n \nNo: Avellani, Burton, Cook, Dean-Bailey, Ellis, Fontneau, Gourgue, Graham, Horgan, Horrigan, Krans, William Marsh, McNally, Mullen, Nelson, Opderbecke, Schmidt, Scruton, Smith, Southworth, Spang, Sprague, Stone, Turcotte, Wall, Woitkun \n \nNot voting: Pitre, Vincent, excused; Berube, Harrington, Varney, not excused \n \nRoll call listings for legislators who do did not vote may have a reference of \"excused\" or \"not excused.\" If a member cannot attend a meeting or make a roll call due to illness or family and business obligations, they may inform the House speaker or Senate president and ask to be excused from the vote. If they do not make that request, they will be listed as not excused.  \n \nCitizens may present testimony in person, by letter or email on any issue.

It shut down his former team and then the potent Packers to get to the title match with New England. \n \nBefore Quinn begins figuring out how to figure out Brady, Bill Belichick and the rest of the Patriots, his first task is simply guiding the Falcons down a path they aren't familiar with. \n \nRegardless of how that Super Bowl turned out two years back, at least Quinn has traveled this way twice before, including a romp over Denver in February 2014, when his D was too much for Peyton Manning and the Broncos. \n \n\"For a lot of guys, playing in their first divisional game a couple weeks ago, and playing in their first NFC championship game, and all those experiences are new,\" Quinn said. \"You have to have awareness for those. And this experience is different, also. I want to fully recognize that. \n \n\"However, when we do get to the game, it's still going to be the game. There's a lot of hype that leads up to it. There's more media exposure that goes along with it. But our process of getting ready doesn't change. \n \n\"Our intent of how we're going to play doesn't change. The attitude and identity that we want to play with doesn't change. So those things are going to stay really consistent and really the same.\" \n \nReally consistent and really the same is what can be expected from the other side. No team or coaching staff is better at planning for a specific opponent than the Patriots. Belichick, defensive coordinator Matt Patricia offensive coordinator and Josh McDaniels will devise strategies that can rob Atlanta of its most dangerous options. \n \nIf that means shutting down All-Pro receiver Julio Jones, that's where New England will focus. If it means neutralizing NFL sacks leader Vic Beasley Jr., that's also where the Patriots will concentrate efforts. \n \nThis is old hat for Belichick, in his record seventh Super Bowl as head coach (he's 4-2). The spotlight in this matchup will glare on Quinn, and not just because he is more personable and entertaining. \n \nJust how will he handle the biggest challenge of his career? \n \nTechnically, he's already into it. Speaking of Brady's prolific offense \u2014 yes, Atlanta's was even more prolific in 2016, but the season's final game is an entirely different scenario \u2014 Quinn was spot-on. \n \n\"Number one, they're difficult to defend,\" he said. \"They use a variety of different formations, personnel groups. They've got a huge playbook from the pass game into the run game, the gap schemes, trap schemes and run game, quick game. So I would say it's offense that's well-versed. They have different ways to attack you.\" \n \nQuinn knows his defense must be doing just as much attacking. He need look no further back than the Patriots' rout of Pittsburgh last Sunday to see what happens when a team takes the conservative route. \n \nFortunately for the Falcons, Quinn, like mentor Pete Carroll, is often a turn-it-loose coach. Those units that helped carry Seattle to the top of the NFC and to a Lombardi Trophy were assertive, relentless and, well, downright nasty. \n \nHe needs for those traits to spill over into this Super Bowl. \n \nQuinn also must make sure offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, in what appears to be his final game with Atlanta before taking over as head coach in San Francisco, attacks from the outset, too. Trying to outsmart the Patriots isn't the trick to winning. Outplaying them is. \n \nWhile Quinn assesses those challenges, Belichick dryly explains what his coaches can use from two years ago. \n \n\"Yeah, sure, they have some of their own characteristics and of course the players are different, so that makes it different. But schematically there is quite a bit of carry-over,\" Belichick said of Seahawks-Falcons similarities. \n \n\"I think just kind of at first glance it might be a little more pressure from Atlanta than Seattle ran, but you know, Seattle did some of it, too. \n \n\"I think overall the schemes are very similar, so the players that you can relate to those schemes are. Both teams have them: (Kam) Chancellor and (Keanu) Neal,\" Belichick said of the big-hitting safeties for Seattle and Atlanta. \n \n\"Go right down the line. They're similar. They play a similar position in a similar defense, so that's the player. I'm not saying their skills are the same, but that's what they do.\" \n \nNo one is saying the skills of the head coaches are the same right now, at least judging by the resumes. But one thing to remember about Dan Quinn is that he won't back off. \n \nAnd that's the best way to take on New England.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: American football news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: NFL news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Dan Quinn's Super Bowl task: matching up with Belichick","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cole","zipCode":"65101","state":"Missouri","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Jefferson City","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Jefferson City News Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"174477660","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"461"},"name":"Jefferson City News Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.newstribune.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195924205","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Over the course of time, I started to experiment a little bit, mostly on myself, playing around with different ways of eating \u2026\u201d \n  Approaching Food as Medicine  \nShe also conducted a study, in which she asked patients about their use of alternative and complementary practices to treat their Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis . \n  \nShe was surprised to discover that 70 percent of them were using some kind of complementary or alternative technique, sometimes in addition to conventional medicine. \n   \n\u201cIt was a sort of don\u2019t-ask-don\u2019t-tell policy,\u201d she says . \u201cI started to get interested and I wanted to know what people were doing and if it was helping \u2026 \n   \nThis was the time when the specific-carbohydrate diet, which is very similar to the Paleo diet, had been popularized \u2026 I clearly remember the first patient I sat down with who \u2026 had had severe Crohn\u2019s disease. She came back and was feeling great \u2026 \n   \nShe was eating lean protein, lots of vegetables, and some nuts and seeds \u2026 I remember doing her colonoscopy and seeing her very severe Crohn\u2019s healed. I could not believe it. I said \u2018I\u2019ve got to find out more about this.\u2019 \n   \nI think it really was the patients who caused me to question what we were doing. I started looking at the drugs we were using and the side effects. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m all for judicious use of conventional drugs when you don\u2019t have lots of other options. \n   \nBut to be strongly recommending drugs that we know can cause cancer and severe infection and other problems, and not having any conversation about this concept of foodist medicine, which is so well-proven, particularly in the gastroenterology world, I think that\u2019s medical negligence.\u201d \n  How C-Section Can Set a Child on the Path Toward Autoimmune Disease  \nAnother incentive driving Chutkan\u2019s growing interest in alternative treatments was her daughter. She was delivered via C-section, and because Chutkan had contracted influenza right before the delivery, her newborn daughter was given antibiotics as a precaution. \n  \nThis was the beginning of a long series of illnesses, where she\u2019d get sick, receive another round of antibiotics, only to get sick again and receive more medication. By the age of 2, her daughter had received 16 rounds of antibiotics. \n  \nAccording to Chutkan, this pattern is very common among patients who are subsequently diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. Many are C-section babies who were then bottle fed and received multiple rounds of antibiotics. \n   \n\u201cI saw her heading down that road and I said \u2018I really have to do something. If we don\u2019t stop this cycle, this is what\u2019s going to happen.\u2019 \n   \nI\u2019m proud to be a doctor, but it\u2019s sometimes hard to hold your head up these days because in my office, most of what I spend my time doing is trying to undo medical mischief. \n   \nWell-meaning physicians who either are not well-informed or just have tunnel vision; dermatologists putting young people on years of potent antibiotics, when you consider the fact that five days of a broad-spectrum antibiotic \u2026 can remove a third of your gut bacteria \u2026  We are creating disease.\u201d \n  Avoid Antibiotics Unless Your Life Hangs in the Balance    \nIndeed, one of the worst things you can do during pregnancy is to take an antibiotic . Young children also need to be shielded from antibiotics, as they devastate the microbiome . Perhaps the single most important take-home point is to avoid antibiotics unless your life hangs in the balance. \n  \nDon\u2019t take them frivolously, and certainly not as a precautionary measure. Other medications best avoided, due to their devastating impact on your microbiome include: \n  \n\u2022 Hormone treatments, including birth control pills \n \n\u2022 Antibacterial products containing triclosan \n \n\u2022 Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). According to Chutkan, recent research shows 20 percent of the bacteria in the microbiome are changed from long-term use of acid suppressing drugs. \n \nIn fact, the authors concluded that PPI use was just as dangerous as antibiotic use in the long term. Despite that, gastroenterologists routinely put patients on long-term acid suppression without giving it a second thought \n  \nShould you have an infection, there are a number of alternatives to antibiotics you can try. For example, D-mannose is very effective against urinary tract infections. \u201cWe use a topical form of probiotics mixed with coconut oil for bacterial vaginosis for women. It works great,\u201d Chutkan says. \n Beware of Hidden Antibiotics  \nChutkan also addresses the issue of hidden antibiotics. Eighty percent of all the antibiotics sold in the U.S. are actually used in the food industry. Animals raised in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are routinely given low-dose antibiotics to prevent disease associated with factory farming. So while you may be really judicious about medical antibiotics, you may still ingest antibiotics through factory-farmed food, especially animal products. \n  \n\u201cI think this is an area where it\u2019s really important to buy organic and to know not just what you\u2019re eating, but what the food you\u2019re eating has eaten, tracing it all the way back, because 80 percent, that\u2019s an astounding number; we already have the highest per capita consumption of antibiotics in the world \u2026 \n   \nFrom infancy, the average American child will take somewhere around 18 to 20 courses of antibiotics by their 18th birthday. Then you add to that, how many courses of antibiotics they\u2019re probably ingesting with food. It\u2019s really astounding. It\u2019s almost like the myth of Sisyphus. \n   \nWe\u2019re on this treadmill. From the minute we\u2019re born \u2014 one could argue even before birth with the in-utero exposure \u2014 we are in this incredible downward spiral to destroy our microbiome. You have to be so vigilant about all of these things.\u201d \n  Fecal Microbiota Transplant \u2014 a Potentially Life-Saving Procedure  \nChutkan\u2019s book, \u201cThe Microbiome Solution,\u201d provides an excellent chapter on fecal microbiota transplants (FMTs). It even includes instructions on how to do it yourself, were you to choose that route. While most people are not candidates for a stool transplant, it can be a life-saving measure in extreme cases. That said, it\u2019s important to understand that the stool transplant is only as good as a donor\u2019s stool. \n  \n\u201cI love my husband very much, but he grew up playing football and eating Burger King every day after practice. I don\u2019t want his stool, because it\u2019s probably not robust enough, growing up eating a standard American diet and taking the usual arsenal of medications. \n   \nI\u2019ve always said, if I ever develop a severe autoimmune disease \u2026 and I am failing the typical options, I\u2019m heading to Tanzania to get some stool from the Hadza tribe, or down to the Amazon. I want some high-octane stool,\u201d Chutkan says. \u201cWhen you contemplate donor stool, it\u2019s not just a matter of excluding serious infectious diseases like HIV, syphilis or hepatitis. It\u2019s really about evaluating how robust the microbiome of your donor is\u2026\u201d \n  Your Microbiome Is Constantly Changing and, With That, Your Health  \nWhile an FMT can be highly beneficial in extreme cases, the vast majority of people simply need to optimize their own microbiome through dietary and lifestyle changes. The good news is our microbiomes are constantly changing, based on diet and environmental exposures, so you have a great deal of personal control. \n \nIf you have a long history of antibiotic use, it may be more difficult for you to shift your gut flora and repair the cellular-microbial damage that has already occurred. But you can still improve a great deal. \n  \n\u201cFor most people who have eaten poorly [and] taken some drugs, there is incredible opportunity for recovery, but it really has to be meaningful change,\u201d Chutkan says . \u201cThe idea that you can continue to eat potato chips and soda and not eat vegetables and just take a fancy probiotic and get better, is really magical thinking. I really try to stress in my practice that it\u2019s not the microbes that you put in your body; it\u2019s what you feed those microbes.\u201d \n  \nFiber-rich vegetables are massively important. Not only do they provide valuable nutrients your body needs, they also provide nutrition to the microbes in your gut, which feed on fiber. Another part of the equation is eating foods grown in healthy soils . Factory-farmed vegetables grown in nutrient-poor soils are not going to give you the same bang for your buck. \n \nAs noted by Chutkan and many other health experts, nutrition and human health really starts in the soil. To learn more, check out Dr. Maya Shetreat-Klein\u2019s book \"The Dirt Cure: Growing Healthy Kids With Food Straight from Soil.\" \n How to Optimize Your Baby\u2019s Health If a C-Section Is Unavoidable  \nSince you\u2019re bypassing the birth canal, children born via C-section are not \u201cinoculated\u201d with their mother\u2019s bacteria. Sometimes a C-section is necessary. It can be lifesaving for the baby or the mother. But evidence suggests C-sections are vastly overused in the U.S., and most are not medically necessary. \n \nIn her book, Chutkan includes a complete birthing plan to optimize your and your baby\u2019s microbiome, and it begins with the recommendation to avoid C-section at all cost, unless medically necessary.  \n  \n\u201cYou really have to push because, again, your physician is very well-meaning, but they have been trained and indoctrinated to think that a C-section is fine. You might find yourself in the unusual position of having to educate your physician about the risks of C-section. There\u2019s plenty of good information out there to do that. The first thing is to try and avoid it,\u201d she says . \n   \n\u201cIf you have to have a C-section, I love the information Dr. Maria Gloria Dominguez-Bello provides [on] vaginal seeding \u2026 [M]ake sure your doctor and their team know about this. Because if you start doing this and people don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, they\u2019re going to call security and take the baby away. \n   \nThe idea is to take a gauze pad and soak it in the perineal juices \u2026 Then when the baby is born via C-section, instead of essentially disinfecting them with antibacterial products like they do in the hospital, take this vaginal pad that\u2019s soaked in all this wonderful flora from the mother and wipe the baby down, especially the head, the eyes, the mouth, all of that. Wipe them down so you\u2019re sort of approximating a vaginal birth.\u201d \n  \nAccording to Chutkan, studies show babies born vaginally are colonized with Bifidobacteria, lactobacillus and many other healthy bacteria from the mother\u2019s microbiome. C-section babies are colonized mostly with hospital-acquired staph, and this microbial difference can follow the child for years to come. \n \nNot surprisingly then, C-section babies tend to have higher rates of allergy, asthma, obesity and autoimmune diseases \u2014 all of which have been linked to poor microbial diversity and makeup. Being able to intervene with this vaginal seeding technique is quite brilliant, and could go a long way toward normalizing your baby\u2019s microbiome if you have to have a C-section. \n Other Dos and Don\u2019ts for New Parents  \nNext comes breastfeeding. Not only is breast milk nutritionally superior to formula, it also has a direct impact on your baby\u2019s microbiome. The third most common ingredient in breast milk is human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), a type of sugar that is completely indigestible. It provides no nutrition per se, rather it nourishes the beneficial bacteria in your baby\u2019s digestive tract, which in turn helps repel staph and other potentially harmful microbes, including microbes that may linger on your nipples. \n  \n\u201cIt\u2019s a great example of this synergy between what\u2019s happening on the mother\u2019s side and what\u2019s going on in the baby\u2019s side, and how it\u2019s all supposed to work together. That\u2019s another critical thing for people to know,\u201d Chutkan says, adding: \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much stuff gets done to you in the hospital that you don\u2019t know about. Most women don\u2019t know they get antibiotics for a C-section \u2026 I didn\u2019t know that my daughter got not one but two potent antibiotics intravenously in the neonatal intensive care unit. You sign a general consent for treatment \u2026   \n   \nYou know that doctors are well meaning. You know they\u2019re vested in a good outcome for the health of your child, but you make the crucial mistake of thinking they know and completely understand the ramifications of what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s clear that they don\u2019t, and so you have to be very aware of that \u2026   \n   \nYour doctors, for the most part \u2026 are lovely, well-meaning people, but they are not well-informed. They are getting their medical information from sources that compel them to keep practicing [a certain] way.\u201d \n  Vitamin D and Inflammatory Bowel Disease  \nAs previously noted, Chutkan\u2019s specialty is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a serious autoimmune disease that can be lethal. IBD is not to be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is a functional disease \u2014 it can be painful and disabling, but it\u2019s not going to kill you. IBD patients are frequently prescribed very toxic drugs and may even require surgery to remove a part of their colon. \n \nIf you have IBD, optimizing your vitamin D to a level between 40 and 60 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) is an important consideration. Crohn\u2019s patients also need to pay attention to vitamin B12, because when your ileum \u2014 the end part of your small intestine \u2014 is inflamed or has been surgically removed, you cannot absorb B12 as efficiently. Malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K, magnesium, iron and more, can also occur. \n  \n\u201cVitamin D has definitely been shown in many studies to be important for inflammation in general, certainly in patients with IBD,\u201d Chutkan says . \u201cIt\u2019s one of the first things we check and make sure that people are adequately supplemented \u2026 We have people we put on high-dose supplementation \u2026 if they\u2019re down in the single digits \u2026 I recommend getting 20 minutes of sun exposure [on] upper body, arms and shoulders, without sunscreen, each day.\u201d \n  On Treating IBD  \nWhen it comes to treating IBD, Chutkan focuses on using food as medicine, and in 77 percent of cases, her patients will no longer need immune modifying agents once they\u2019ve properly adjusted their diet. She typically begins by assessing the level of inflammation. The most challenging situation is when you have \u201cfibrostenotic disease,\u201d where Crohn\u2019s disease has caused severe scarring and narrowing of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In some cases, it can be severe enough to be irreversible. \n \nPeople with colitis who have a lot of ulceration in the colon, and people who have Crohn\u2019s who don\u2019t have a lot of scarring but have active ulceration, are generally able to successfully treat their condition through diet. Next, she screens for nutrient deficiencies, such as vitamin D, B12, ferritin and fat-soluble vitamins, and begins assessing the diet. Chutkan uses a combination diet that is part specific-carbohydrate diet, part paleo and part vegan. \n Increasing Vegetable Intake Is Crucial  \nThree years ago, Chutkan and colleagues published a small pilot study consisting of 12 patients, nine with Crohn\u2019s and three with ulcerative colitis. \n  \n\u201cWe looked retrospectively at the diet. We found some interesting things. We found that the average time for the diet to work was about 90 days. When I say to work, to really kick in to the point where people felt like they were in remission. But some people notice results in as quickly as two to three days. Other people take several months. Ninety days was kind of the sweet spot. \n   \nTwo-thirds of patients were able to get off their medication or significantly reduce their medication. Again, the majority of people, when we looked endoscopically, had healing of the inflammation. \n   \nBut this is the most important part of the study: everybody took out the processed carbohydrates. Everybody was off gluten, off refined sugar. Essentially grain-free for the most part. As people get better, we do add in some brown rice, some legumes and so on. For the most part, it was looking like a modified paleo diet. But there were two distinct groups: the group who got better and the group who didn\u2019t, despite excluding all the not-so-great stuff. What was the difference? \n   \nThe difference was the amount of vegetables people were consuming. The people who took out the gluten and the processed sugars \u2026 without increasing their vegetable intake, did not tend to do a lot better. The people who really ramped up their consumption of green leafy vegetables, and particularly the stringy vegetables like celery, asparagus and artichokes, which are high in inulin that really feed gut bacteria, did significantly better.\u201d \n  \nSo, a key take-home point here is that it\u2019s not enough to simply remove certain foods, such as sugar and refined grains. You must also replace them with a significant amount of vegetables. In fact, there appears to be a critical threshold when it comes to vegetables, which you must meet in order to see meaningful changes in your health. Terry Wahls has noted that multiple sclerosis (MS) patients typically need six to nine servings of leafy greens each day in order to affect positive change. \n \nChutkan says the same applies to autoimmune patients with Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis. Each morning, she makes herself a green smoothie with spinach, kale, celery, parsley, green apple, a peeled lemon, some fresh ginger and water. Each day, she\u2019ll drink two to four glasses. \n On Breaking the Mold  \nChutkan is a perfect example of a conventional physician who, by listening to her patients and keeping an open mind, broke through the brainwashing \u2014 the carefully orchestrated propaganda created by the drug and medical industries. And she shares a great deal of priceless information in her book, \u201c The Microbiome Solution .\u201d \n  \n\u201c[W]hen I saw the results of a meta-analysis out of Mount Sinai hospital \u2026 looking at over 7,000 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and identifying frequent antibiotic use, particularly in childhood, as one of the main risk factors for developing IBD, I said, \u2018People have to know this\u2019 \n   \n\u2026 [A]s an author, it is an incredible privilege to be able to put your nickel down and say \u2018This is what I think. This is what I believe in. I feel an obligation to share it with you.\u2019 But it\u2019s also scary. People come after you \u2026  \n   \nI had a lot of conversations with Penguin about what I could or couldn\u2019t say, or should or shouldn\u2019t say. It\u2019s scary because you know there\u2019s an incredible amount of money being made by some of these companies. When you say something that\u2019s critical, their goal is to crush you. They\u2019ve done it very effectively to a lot of people we know. \n   \nIt\u2019s scary but you get to the point where you feel like you cannot legitimately not share this information with people. As you know, books are not a way to get rich, right? Typically, books are probably, at best, a break-even proposition, or you lose money writing a book when you think about the amount of time it takes. \n   \nBut it is an incredible way to take this information out of the office \u2026 and get it into the hands of millions of people. That\u2019s a wonderful privilege \u2026 I do have to say that I am emboldened by practitioners like you who have been doing this for a very long time and play such an important role in this education of the public. \n   \nYou\u2019ve been criticized by conventional medicine and by pharmaceutical companies. It really emboldens those of us who have our eyes open to say \u2018You know what? I\u2019m going to speak the truth. I\u2019m going to educate patients. I\u2019m going to try to bring a few colleagues along. I\u2019m going to be okay.\u2019\u201d \n  How Patients Can Help Their Doctors  \nAs noted by Chutkan, many doctors still do not realize the wool has been pulled over their eyes. They don\u2019t realize they are being used to market drugs for pharmaceutical companies \u2014 some of which are effective, others not so much, and virtually all of which have side effects.  \n \nHowever, all is not lost. Just like Chutkan came to see the light after being repeatedly prompted by her patients to provide answers other than drugs, you too can affect positive change by talking to and informing your doctor about strategies that are important to you. \n  \n\u201cI think \u2026 it\u2019s so important for patients to not just abandon their doctors,\u201d she says . \u201cIf you have a doctor and you have a decent relationship with them, but they\u2019re still hell bent on prescribing an antibiotic you don\u2019t need, I think it\u2019s so important to say to them \u2018This is why I don\u2019t want to take the antibiotic. Here is a book you should read.\u2019 \n   \nBecause that\u2019s what people did with me. People trusted me. They felt that I had their best interest at heart. They took the time to educate me and I\u2019m so glad they did. I think we have to bring a colleague along. We have to bring our physicians along and not just abandon them entirely.\u201d \n  \nOne of the books you can bring your physician if he or she wants to prescribe antibiotics is \u201c The Microbiome Solution .\u201d It should really open their eyes. Chutkan is incredibly articulate, and her book is chockfull of valuable information that can have a tremendously beneficial impact on your health.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Dr. Mercola"},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer: health news","group":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"The Microbiome Solution \u2014 Healing Your Body From the Inside Out","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Mercola","feed":{"genre":"Blog","tags":[],"id":"169789679","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"658"},"name":"Mercola","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Health","Lifestyle","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mercola.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.amazon.com/Microbiome-Solution-Radical-Heal-Inside-ebook/dp/B00RW1ZUCS"],"sequenceId":"695195924542","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

In an announcement about the move, Dan Powers, president of the Sig Sauer ammunition division, said Arkansas offered \"exceptional economic incentives\" and company officials later said electricity costs in Arkansas are half that of New Hampshire's, with Sig's savings exceeding $1 million a year. \n \nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Sig's cited electric rates are right on the money. \n \nThe federal agency reports residential electric rates for consumers in New Hampshire were 18.93 cents per kilowatt hour in October 2016, compared to 9.85 cents per kilowatt hour in Arkansas. Commercial electric rates for the same month were 14.57 cents a kilowatt hour in New Hampshire and 8.09 cents in Arkansas. \n \nSpeaking for BIA members, Flynn said high electricity costs are due to supply limitations and additional transmission costs. He said he's heard from members, who he declined to identify, that are contemplating leaving the state, or if they're planning expansions, launching those out-of-state, because of the electric rates. In addition to a statewide workforce shortage, Flynn said, the cost of electricity is a top concern for the state's business community.  \n \n\"Electric bills are high,\" said Jim Teetzel, owner of Wilcox Industries, another Newington gun maker, but he calls it \"the cost of doing business.\"  \n \n\"When I hear a company is moving a plant solely because of energy, it just doesn't make sense,\" he said. \"We spend over $50,000 a month on electricity because we have a lot of machinery. That's just not a factor we consider and we probably chew up more electricity than anyone in the area. Would I like lower bills? Of course. Who wouldn't.\"  \n \nTeetzel said the cost of electricity is not enough to drive an established business out of state, but would be a consideration when planning a new business. Electric rates are a business consideration, he said, \"but not a reason to move.\" \n \nHe said he's in favor of power supplier Eversource's Northern Pass project, which would bring hydropower to the region from Canada, while acknowledging the execution is \"challenging.\" Opponents continue to fight the plan and it remains in a prolonged period of regulatory review. \n \nFlynn said the BIA is urging its members to speak out about high electricity costs to \"raise awareness\" of the fact that \"what you're paying here is a lot more than in other states.\" He said it's possible to bring rates down by increasing supply across New England.  \n \nGov. Sununu's spokesman, David Abrams, responded to an inquiry about energy and business in the state with the following statement the governor made in December at the BIA's New Hampshire Energy Symposium. \n \n\"Now there are lots of pieces to that puzzle,\" Sununu was quoted. \"There\u2019s renewable energy. What are we doing with our current infrastructure? We have new plants that are going offline. We have Northern Pass coming in. We have the potential for natural gas, but it has to be done the New Hampshire way. The right way.\u201d \n \nAlso at BIA's New Hampshire Energy Symposium in December, Robert Michalski, vice president of operations for Stratham chocolate maker, Lindt & Sprungli, was quoted by the New Hampshire Union Leader saying the company pays more than $5 million a year for electricity and expects that to rise by another half-million dollars this year.  \n \n\"The concerning part for us is that we are at this point, the company is not willing to grow any more in New Hampshire,\u201d Michalski was quoted by the Union Leader. \u201cThe only way that we\u2019re going to be able to grow in New Hampshire further is by finding ways to reduce our energy, our energy costs in this state.\u201d \n \nA spokeswoman at Michalski's office said last week that he no longer works for Lindt. Asked for someone else to speak on behalf of the company about energy costs, she said no one from the company \"is allowed to be quoted in the media.\"  \n \nEnergy demand on the Seacoast has been cited by Eversource as growing twice as fast the rest of the state. To meet the demand, Eversource currently seeks approval for construction of a new 13-mile transmission line, to run between existing power stations in Portsmouth and Madbury. The state's Site Evaluation Committee is expected to respond to the application this year, while Eversource says it hopes to complete the \"Seacoast Reliability Project\" in 2018. That project is also facing strong opposition from those concerned about the environmental impact of the line. \n \nBehind the scenes, said Don Kreis, a staff lawyer and consumer advocate for the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, Eversource is fighting in the New Hampshire Supreme Court to try to have its customers pay for a new gas pipeline. Kreis said the PUC denied Eversource's plan to pass the pipeline cost onto to consumers and Eversource recently filed an appeal with the state's highest court. \n \nThe PUC describes its mission as \"vested with general jurisdiction over electric, telecommunications, natural gas, water and sewer utilities as defined in RSA 362:2 for issues such as rates, quality of service, finance, accounting and safety. It is the PUC\u2019s mission to ensure customers of regulated utilities receive safe, adequate and reliable service at just and reasonable rates.\" \n \nKreis explained that New England is farther away from cheaper fossil fuels, which has historically been coal, which drives up the cost. Natural gas prices are low and New England is close to sources in Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio, which has led to electric companies arguing there's a need for more gas pipelines to move more gas, he said. \n \n\"We have more than adequate supplies of natural gas, but when it's really cold, natural gas generators, without firm contracts, say they supposedly don't have enough to go around,\" Kreis said. \n \nIn 2014, Eversource, when it was known as Public Service of New Hampshire, purchased land at 445 Route 1 Bypass in Portsmouth for construction of a new electrical substation. In an application to the city to build the substation, PSNH reported it was needed to meet an increased demand for electricity, as well as new development-driven demand. With anticipated new demand for electricity, due to Portsmouth \"projects under development, or in the planning stages,\" PSNH informed the city three years ago that demand for electricity would exceed capacity by 2016, without new infrastructure such as the new bypass substation, that's now in operation. \n \nKreis said expanded infrastructure throughout the region, paired with energy conservation, are the solutions to the area's energy challenges. With that, he said, prices would lower. \n \nHe said businesses can and should conduct energy audits and consider ways to retrofit their operations to reduce energy consumption and affiliated costs. He said energy providers have budgets for a program that offers energy audits and can, as an example, identify parts of a factory using the most electricity and offer suggestions, like more efficient motors. Food factories and businesses, he said, should explore more energy-efficient refrigeration units.  \n \nKreis explained that electricity is traded by the independent group ISO New England and the rate varies every five minutes. ISO brokers the electricity markets, to retailers who sell to customers and from companies that generate electricity. Peak demand for electricity in New England, Kries said, is generally on a hot August afternoon.  \n \nISO spokesman Matt Kakley explained that his organization manages the electricity market like the stock market and doesn't set prices. He said natural gas is the predominant fuel used to create electricity in New England and, \"When the natural gas pipelines transporting gas into New England have room left over after heating customers are served, that cheap natural gas can make it into New England. When the pipelines are running full just to serve heating customers, natural gas prices spike and then wholesale electricity prices go up, too.\" \n \nKakley said at times the pipelines carrying gas into New England aren\u2019t sufficient to transport enough natural gas to meet demand. \n\n \n\"We see this especially on very cold winter days when heating demand for natural gas is high, which coincides with high demand for gas for electricity production,\" he said  Constraints on the natural gas pipelines can push up the price of natural gas, which can also increase the price of wholesale electricity.\" \n \nThe Nothern Pass plan would reportedly create more energy via a 192-mile transmission line bringing hydropower from Canada, but has met resistance. Kreis said Sununu \"has a lot of influence,\" but it's up to a state's Site Evaluation Committee to decide whether to move that forward.  \n \nFlynn said the BIA does not take positions with regard to specific infrastructure projects, but is \"trying to advocate against legislation\" that would make it harder to build new energy infrastructure. The BIA's website \"EnergizeNH\" calls the situation an \"electrical energy crisis\" and calls for \"state and regional policies and initiatives that enable the development of low-cost, reliable sources of energy, including expanded natural gas pipeline capacity and increased electrical transmission, into the region.\" \n \nThe BIA reports it is \"concerned about the high cost of electricity because it makes New Hampshire less competitive, jeopardizes current and future jobs, and threatens the state\u2019s economy as businesses grow (or relocate) operations and employment outside New Hampshire and New England.  \n \nKreis said, \"Speaking as a citizen, we need to find ways to strengthen our economy and not rely on persuading employers not to leave. There's always going to be another state with a better deal. It's true, we have high energy costs, but we have other things that make it a better place to be in business.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Elizabeth Dinan edinan@seacoastonline.com @DinanElizabeth"},"topics":[],"title":"'Energy crisis'","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Rockingham","zipCode":"03801","state":"New Hampshire","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Portsmouth","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Seacoast Online","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169678066","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2297"},"name":"Seacoast Online","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://seacoastonline.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195924865","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:48Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

A silent undercurrent among voters has positioned the newest party on the state\u2019s political scene as a contender to form the government after next month\u2019s assembly elections. \n \nVoters in rural areas, especially among the state\u2019s youth, as well as sections of Dalits, seem to be backing the AAP in the run-up to the elections to the 117-seat assembly scheduled for February 4. \n \n\u201cThe Aam Party (as the AAP is commonly referred to in Punjab\u2019s rural areas and towns) is attracting the youth. Many other voters have also become wary of the Akali Dal-BJP alliance and the Congress,\u201d Happy Singh, a taxi driver from Samrala town, 65 km from here, told IANS. \n \nThe AAP, which has still not projected its chief ministerial candidate, is banking on its large army of volunteers to make an impact in a state where the fledgling party has seen grassroots support. \n \nIn the 2014 Lok Sabha general election, four of Punjab\u2019s 13 parliamentary constituencies elected AAP candidates to the Lok Sabha even as the Narendra Modi wave was sweeping large parts of the country. The AAP drew a blank elsewhere in the country. \n \n\u201cThe fact that the Akali Dal-BJP and the Congress see a common enemy in AAP clearly shows how much ground this party has covered in Punjab in less than three years. People are fed up with the same leaders and the same old policies being projected by the Akalis and the Congress. Many voters want to see a change now,\u201d said Swaran Singh, an agriculturist in Sangrur district. \n \nDespite internal bickering in the Punjab AAP unit, including the sacking of its state convener Sucha Singh Chhotepur and several units and leaders revolting before and after ticket distribution, the party leadership is confident of getting a majority on its own. \n \nEarlier projections, till the beginning of last year, gave 75-100 seats to the AAP, a party that created ripples when it swept Delhi in early 2015, winning 67 of the 70 seats and handing Prime Minister Modi his first electoral defeat after his sweeping 2014 victory. \n \nSince then, things have changed for AAP as the Congress has gone into overdrive, with state Congress president Amarinder Singh at the helm, to revive the party. \n \n\u201cWe are definitely going to have a two-thirds majority and end the mafia rule of the Akalis. The AAP and Akalis are fighting for the 2nd and 3rd positions,\u201d Amarinder Singh said. \n \nThe AAP, which led in 33 assembly segments in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and was second in a few segments, is eyeing increasing its lead in more assembly segments. \n \nThe AAP has good support in Punjab\u2019s agriculturally-dominant Malwa belt (south of the river Sutlej) comprising the districts of Sangrur, Patiala, Mansa, Muktsar, Bathinda, Ludhiana, Moga, Ferozepur, Faridkot and Fazilka. This belt accounts for around 70 assembly seats. \n \n\u201cWe will do quite well in the Majha belt (north of the river Beas) also. People are extending support to AAP in a big way,\u201d AAP\u2019s Amritsar-south seat candidate Inderbir Singh Nijjer, a doctor by profession, told IANS. \n \nThe AAP leaders and cadre will have to work hard in the Doaba (area between the Beas and Sutlej rivers) and Majha to be able to take a shot at power in Punjab. \n \nThe party\u2019s support from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) can help AAP cover some ground on this front.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"In AAP, the three main Punjab parties see a common enemy","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Mangalorean","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169686787","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"25"},"name":"Mangalorean","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.mangalorean.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195926063","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:49Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Should all development be controlled and sustainable? Should only economic considerations be measured? Should a particular development or an area to be developed only be accepted and permitted if it is economically feasible for the owner of the land or the developer thereof, or should other considerations be calculated and given a cost or value? \n \nIn my opinion, the local natural and built-up environment has a far superior economic, social and cultural value than any haphazard development. \n \nI speak of \u2018haphazard development\u2019 as a style opposed to controlled or planned development. Malta has had different construction- or reconstruction-led periods of development, the first being the different periods of construction from the Iron Age down to the end of Malta\u2019s occupation by the Knights. \n \nThese were periods of a miniscule local population, where construction was small-scale, built for a purpose and controlled by the ruling powers. Despite the fact that structures like the three Cities, Valletta, Mdina and the Cittadella as well as the prehistoric temples all tower on hilltops, thus spoiling the natural environment, they have melded with the natural colours and shapes. Using local stone, low heights and squarish shapes, they served their purpose to offer secure protective areas for the small population of the time, but were also built with beauty that has lasted throughout the ages. They now serve as a basis for one of the major pillars of our modern economy \u2013 tourism. \n  \n\"Once permits are given, the Maltese nature is to cheat a little, add a little, encroach a little.\" \n  \nThe same applies to the numerous village and city churches that brought artists and artisans to our islands and gave us the town and village way of life \u2013 with circular expansions of low housing crowding around the dominant church structure. Humans could relate to each other, living close to family, friends and whatever linked them together \u2013 the bar, the banda, the church, the ladies circles, the school, etc. This is the Maltese way of life. \n \nThe second period, also one of planned construction, was that of the ensuing 100 years after the Knights \u2013 the British occupation. During this period, our population exploded with growth generated by the war economies. Construction was geared towards defence, military installations, airfields and barracks, but also towards new urban areas such as Sliema and Paola, and the expansion of towns like Birkirkara and Hamrun. \n \nOnce again there was control by the authorities, and the terraced houses of the new towns had gardens, regular blocks with good roads and sanitation, but always with local materials and limited heights. Spectacular developments along these lines graced Sliema Seafront, with over 200 jewels of period houses. It would have compared with the best that coastal cities in France and Italy can offer. Quel dommage! \n \nDuring this period, Malta\u2019s environment was damaged by over-development, and the sprawl of the growing towns, military installations and barracks in many prominent areas like Mtarfa, St Andrews, and Tigné did not improve Malta. However, the height and the building materials remained true to the local colour and texture. Some of these structures later could be re-constructed or restored to be used for other purposes. \n  \nWhat characterised this period, which started to come to an end with the early post-war boom and growth (both in population and wealth), was the control by the ruling authority of the time. It also coincided with the beginning of periods of self-government, and later, Independence. \n \nThis is when Malta\u2019s \u2018haphazard development\u2019 began, and has continued since. \n \nIt may be a coincidence, but it may also be the result of this taking over of control of our destiny by us, the Maltese. Governing ourselves seems, to me, to be the cause of the break of harmony between the environment and development. Unlike our many overseas rulers, we do not seem to have any sense of vision and purpose, except that of economic development. \n \nOf course the economy is and will always remain the main driver, but without a long-term vision and clear definition of what we, the Maltese population, want our island to look like now, in 10, 20, 40 or even 100 years\u2019 time, we will continue to live haphazardly. \n \nMany very good and sustainable constructions have taken shape in these last 80 odd years, and many more will see the light of day. Yet there has never been a long-term plan. Whenever a plan is launched, it only lasts one legislature at most. Very soon, exceptions begin to be made, exemptions given, and permits granted or negotiated. \n \nOnce permits are given, the Maltese nature is to cheat a little, add a little, encroach a little. \n \nWe are unable or unwilling to restrain ourselves and follow the rules. Even when we do follow the rules, our politicians are tempted to change these rules. Our developers and every owner of a house, plot, field or whatever, dream of translating this into a bigger structure. \n \nThe destruction of the Sliema Seafront \u2013 a pearl of the Mediterranean \u2013 to replace it with terrible buildings that are too high and lacking style or collective order is a sin of this generation that our descendants will never forgive us for. \n \nThe Maltese were once described to me as being a people endowed with excessive \u2018criminal energy\u2019. Looking critically at ourselves, this description fits very well in the area of conflict or contradiction between the environment and the classical way of life of the Maltese, and the development by the construction industry of Malta in these last 80 years. \n \nThe terrible growth of all towns has led to one urban sprawl from Zabbar to Paola to Marsa, Zebbug, Qormi, Birkirkara, Mosta, Naxxar, San Gwann, Sliema, Gzira, Msida, Pieta and Valletta, with ugly blocks of pigeonhole flats with terrible shafts and long dark corridors. Older houses lie derelict by the thousands, awaiting destruction to turn from swans to ugly ducklings. \n \nGoing forward, it seems that this lurching forward haphazardly from one set of uncontrolled uglification to another is set to continue. \n \nThe current debate about the need to build upwards even higher and higher on the most cherished and beautiful coastal promontories and even in the dead centre of the island does not fit the Maltese way of life, does not fit the natural environment, and does not use local materials, but will add enormous glass, steel and concrete monsters to the already growing number of glass buildings. They will take light away from neighbours, lower the value of existing housing stock and pander to the needs of a small sliver of foreign investors, business leaders, tax residents and a few wealthy Maltese, and will plunge a stake of social divisiveness into Maltese society. \n  \n\"Older houses lie derelict by the thousands, awaiting destruction to turn from swans to ugly ducklings.\" \n  \nThe prospective customers for this unprecedented race to the skies, amongst our few developers, are in Malta not for the sun, landscape or flats on the 20th or 30th floors of seafront skyscrapers. They are here because of tax, services and other regimes that offer them advantages they do not find in their countries. But similar regimes are also offered in other places. I think of two types of competing locations for regime seekers. The first category are the Dubais and the Singapores of this world, and the second are the Monacos, Genevas, Zurichs and Luxembourgs. \n \nWhich do the Maltese want to be like? The first are high-rise skyscraper conglomerations. The second are European low-to-middle height cities retaining local continuity and human size structures. Prices per square metre are probably higher in Monaco and Zurich than in Dubai. Empty blocks are much fewer in Monaco and Geneva than in Dubai. Yet the tax or regime seekers, whether retirees or businessmen, flock to both types of places. \n \nThus, development does not preclude environmental sustainability. Prices are not set by the type of buildings offered, they are set by the attractiveness of the regimes and the attractiveness of the environment. \n \nThen there is the local population to think of. What do the Maltese, who cannot afford these exceptionally high prices, want? How do they want the island to look for their children and grandchildren? What would happen should the regimes that attract these foreign investors to Malta change? What would happen should there be a slump in the economy, or restrictions imposed by the EU? What would happen should a score or two of these skyscrapers get built, and we face an economic downturn? \n \nThere is too much uncertainty to lurch forward haphazardly. We need a long-term plan that is put to the vote of the population, which is endorsed by experts, that is socially, economically and culturally sustainable, and that is outside the powers of any elected government to change without either two thirds majority in Parliament or similar manacles. \nOur \u2018criminal energy\u2019 or greed should not be the driver of development, but simple protection of the existing environment is not the answer either. A balance must be struck. \n \nBefore finding this balance, before having the population express itself on a couple of alternative long-term plans for Malta and Gozo, I suggest a moratorium on all new construction, allowing only refurbishment and re-construction of the existing stock of buildings and monuments. \n \nThis will keep the labour force and cash flow of our construction industry going. This will also ensure that the ever-growing number of tourists who come to Malta for its weather, history and culture will not begin to decline because we are making Malta unrecognisable and unlivable. \n \nFor me, development that raises the standards of the existing stock of Maltese housing, whether town houses, social housing, flats built in the last 50 years or historical buildings, is more economically sound. We should put an end to damp walls, leaking roofs, asbestos, tanks on roofs, crowded families, draughty windows and doors, and no heating systems \u2013 issues that are endemic to the living areas of most Maltese. Other countries have managed to improve this over the last 100 years of economic growth. We have not. \n \nIt is socially unacceptable. \n  \n\"We need a long-term plan that is put to the vote of the population, which is endorsed by experts, that is socially, economically and culturally sustainable, and that is outside the powers of any elected government to change without either two thirds majority in Parliament or similar manacles.\" \n  \nReconstruction and refurbishment retains the look and way of life that will continue to attract mass tourism. It will produce elegant and 21st century interiors with the platinum or BREAM certificate standards that will suit tax and regime hunters who wish to come here and are most welcome. The bread and butter of our businessmen and women and the jobs for the young generations will be found by serving the 450,000 Maltese and the two million tourists who visit us. The small number of wealthy or business folk will be equally attracted, whether we offer them skyscrapers or palazzi. \nLack of a long-term vision that is signed up to by all citizens and all parties so that the 50 to 100 year plan remains intact throughout the entire period will only promote a continuation of the haphazard development period of our history. Add to this our own national erratic decision-making powers and our criminal energy characteristic, and we are doomed to fail. \n \nAllowing only economic factors, profit and maximization of land space to rule the decision-making is wrong and unsustainable. \n \nThe question to ask is whether we want to continue haphazardly and unsustainably, moving away from our natural building materials to glass, steel and concrete, and rising upwards under the argument that one limits the use of space by going upwards must be first measured against the yardstick of what constitutes planned urban areas, healthy living, and Maltese way of life and sustainability, not just profitability. \n \nRushing now, especially with the results of the US election and the uncertainty it will produce in the world, is foolish. Overinvesting may be damaging to our economy. We should use the time until the dust settles and see how the EU will react. Will the EU regroup and strengthen its common institutions, and act much more in integrated fashion, or will it also fall apart into populism? \n \nBoth scenarios can damage our regimes and attractiveness. If it becomes more unified, we can expect harmonisation of taxation and common rules for provision of services. If it falls apart, the result can be chaotic and investors will be more cautious. Both scenarios would temporarily slow down our present economic growth. \n \nWhen foreign investors come to Malta, they do not come because we present them with elegant, prestigious office spaces or living spaces. They come because the regimes in place allow them to do their business on the fringes but within the EU more profitably then elsewhere. They are more than welcome. \n \nI contend that since they come for the regime, like they go to Dubai, Singapore, Monaco and Geneva for their regimes, then they are neutral to what there is on offer. Prices in Monaco at \u20ac30,000 per square meter are equal to those in Dubai. Malta can still choose to go low-rise or high-rise. Dubai should not be our model. \n  \n\"Malta can still choose to go low-rise or high-rise. Dubai should not be our model.\" \n  \nOur model should be the Malta that the Maltese want \u2013 the Malta that will still attract the normal tourist, our bread and butter, and not a Malta that attracts more of the inward investors who may be only as sustainable as the tax, legal and other regimes that keep them here. \n \nThe same applies to so-called modern retirees who buy flats they do not live in for more than a couple of weeks a year, bringing little value-added to the local economy apart from their initial investment. They come for the tax benefit we offer, out of reach of their tax collectors. They also like what they see of the weather and cultural heritage. \n \nAs we all know, both the tax regime and the gaming regime are under scrutiny and potential attack by the EU. Whether we can keep them intact, tweak them or have to leave the EU to retain them will only be known in the next five to ten years. They are being challenged, as are the regimes of Ireland, Luxembourg and now even Dubai and the Emirates \u2013 our colleagues and competitors. \n \nWere these to change, the investors would leave in the blink of an eyelid \u2013 as quickly as they came. Hopefully, we could replace them with healthcare wealthy tourists, passport buyers and wealthy tax planning retirees, but that is neither secured nor certain. Thus we live in a pretty uncertain economic situation. \n \nFor this reason, I suggest that we take a time out \u2013 some breathing room to take a long look at ourselves as Maltese EU citizens who wish to continue to enjoy living on these God blessed islands of ours. \n \nA final consideration is pure sustainability. With 700,000 people crowding this island every day of the year, making us over 2,500 per sq km with too many cars, too few roads and a very low standard of building stock in the towns, villages and residential centres of Malta, we have a very wealthy country but a very badly distributed quality of life. \n \nWe cannot build a silver or golden set of cages for the wealthy investor, his employees and a few wealthier Maltese, leaving the rest to live miserably. We must raise the quality of life of all Maltese so that we do not create a social divide that is already with us. For our businesses who import, provide services, build and sell, the local and tourist population is their bread and butter. Therefore, high-value clientele is the icing on the cake. We need to raise the buying power and living conditions of our base home market and base touristic market that provides the major part of our revenues before we cater for the elite niche. \n \nWe need to plan and have a vision now.

Some said they had been humiliated. \n \nIran, one of the seven countries, said it would stop U.S. citizens entering the country in retaliation to Washington's visa ban, calling it an \"open affront against the Muslim world and the Iranian nation\". \n \n\"It's not right to portray huge groups of Arabs and Muslims as possible terrorists,\" Najeeb Haidari, a Yemeni-American security manager in Yemen, said a day after Trump put a four-month hold on refugee arrivals and temporarily barred travellers from war-torn Syria and six other mainly Muslim nations. \n \n\"This is a stupid, terrible decision which will hurt the American people more than us or anybody else, because it shows that this president can't manage people, politics or global relationships,\" Haidari added. \n \nSudan called the decision to ban entry of its citizens very unfortunate in light of \"historic steps\" just weeks earlier to lift U.S. sanctions for cooperation on combating terrorism. \n \nIn the most sweeping use of his presidential powers since taking office a week ago, Trump signed an executive order on Friday to pause the entry of travellers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for at least 90 days. \n \nHe said separately he wanted the United States to give priority to Syrian Christians fleeing the war there. The travel curbs began immediately, causing confusion for would-be travellers with passports from the seven countries. \n \nUNFAIR DECISION \n \nSources at Cairo airport said the five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni, arriving in transit to Cairo airport, were stopped and re-directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas. \n \nA Syrian family holding U.S. visas who had travelled overnight from Beirut to Paris was prevented from boarding a connecting flight onto Atlanta, Lebanese airport sources said. They flew back to Beirut later on Saturday. \n \nIn Doha, Qatar Airways advised passengers bound for the United States from the seven newly banned countries that they needed to have either a U.S. green card or a diplomatic visa. \n \nFarea al-Muslimi, a U.S.-educated Yemeni political commentator with the Sana'a Center for Strategic Studies said, \"It's insane - but what part of Trump is sane?\"ers.\" \n \n\"This punishes thousands of innocent people for things they have no control over, when the last few attacks in America had to do with radicalized U.S. citizens, not foreigners.\" \n \nA 34-year-old Sudanese man who won the U.S. Green Card lottery said he was worried he would be forbidden entry. \"If I\u2019m barred...this will destroy my life because I resigned from my work in Sudan and was preparing to settle in America,\" he said. \n \nFariba, an Iranian-American who declined to give her family name and lives in New Jersey, said her parents would not be able to make a planned visit to celebrate Iranian New Year in March. \n \n\"What have we done to deserve such a ban? ... This ban will ruin our lives. Thank you Mr. President. Are you making America great by hurting innocent people?\" \n \nSome people planning U.S. travel said the curbs would harm their careers. Others feared for the safety of their families. \n \n\"HUMILIATING INSULT\" \n \nIn Baghdad, Bayan Adil, a doctor working in the Iraqi Health Ministry who applied for a U.S. visa to attend a medical seminar, said Iraqi academics should visit Europe instead of the United States, where they were no longer welcome. \n \n\"Trump's decision is unfortunately a humiliating insult not only for us as academics but for all Iraqis,\" she said. \n \nHer comments were echoed by Abd Al-Jafar, a 43-year-old university professor in Sudan's capital Khartoum, who said he had sought to go to the United States for doctoral studies. \n \n\"This decision, if implemented, will be a disaster,\" he said. \"I have work in Sudan and have no desire to emigrate to the U.S., just to study there. This decision is illogical.\" \n \nIn Beirut, Joumana Ghazi Chehade, 34, a refugee from Yarmouk in Syria living in the Lebanese capital's Burj al-Barajneh camp, said the decision would \"destroy a lot of people\". \n \n\"Of course we're not going to go blow anything up ... All we are asking for is security and freedom.\" \n \nMirna, an American and a mother of two living in Syria, said it was clear Trump \"doesn't want to receive Syrian Muslims ... we have to expect the worst from him because he is a crazy man.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer: travel news","group":"Lifestyle"},{"name":"Iran news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Egypt news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Iraq news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Yemen news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Fury in the Middle East over US visa ban","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Western Asia","countryCode":"AE","country":"United Arab Emirates"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Arabianindustry.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"368814547","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Arabianindustry.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["TravelTourism","Recreation","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://arabianindustry.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195931882","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

There's a very strong nexus between our immigration and visa programs and terrorist plots and extremist networks inside the United States,\" the official continued. \"Look at the recent, high-profile attacks that have occurred inside the country -- an immigration nexus is not at all uncommon. I won't go through the list of them all now. One obvious example would be Tashfeen Malik and the San Bernadino incident with the K1 visa.\" \n\nA K1 visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to the foreign-citizen fiance of a US citizen. Tashfeen Malik was from a family of wealthy landowners in Pakistan and later moved to Saudi Arabia with her immediate family. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was a US citizen. \n\nPakistan and Saudi Arabia, however, are not on the list of countries subject to the new ban. \n\nThe administration is facing criticism from leaders in the U.S. and around the world for taking steps their critics say are unconstitutional and anti-American. \n\nThe second mention of San Bernardino came when the official was trying to explain why there was no grace period before the executive order went into effect, to help ease implementation. \n\n\"Imagine if this had been an executive order that had been contemplated the day before the San Bernardino shooter entered the United States?\" the official asked. \"Would have delaying its implementation served the best interests of the country? The reality is we don't know who the next individual is who will exploit our immigration programs successfully. If you choose that something is necessary to do for the sake of national security, it should be done immediately.\"","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Trump official incorrectly justifies travel ban","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Yuma","zipCode":"85364","state":"Arizona","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Yuma","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"KYMA KSWT KECY News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"553405030","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"6"},"name":"KYMA KSWT KECY News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Politics","Society","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.kyma.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195932056","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:52Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

L. \"Shorty\" Hardman. \n   \nThe award is voted on by members of the West Virginia Sports Writers Association. \n   \n\"I am very honored and in a bit of shock to hear that I have won the Hardman Award again,\" said Buchanan, a defender who is playing professionally with Olympique Lyonnais, in France. \n   \n\"I was lucky enough to win the award once, but to win it again is a true honor, I believe this is a great reflection of my hard work paying off.\" \n   \nBuchanan. a native of Brampton, Ontario, is the first repeat winner since Marshall University quarterback Rakeem Cato, who won the award for 2013 and 2014. \n   \nShe will be honored May 21 at the 71st Victory Awards Dinner at the Village Square Conference Center in Clarksburg, W.Va. \n   \nBuchanan edged out WVU rifle standout Ginny Thrasher in the Hardman balloting. Thrasher led WVU to an 18th NCAA national title and earned the first Olympic gold medal of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Games. \n   \nRyan Switzer and Segar Bonifant also received support.

However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council. \n \nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet. \n \nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney. \n \nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families. \n \nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\". \n \nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections. \n \nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies. \n \nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\". \n \nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts. \n \nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state. \n \nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs. \n \nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean. \n \nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts. \n \nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation. \n \nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader. \n \nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres. \n \nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts. \n \nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities. \n \nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing. \n \nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence. \n \nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following  Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics  after being told she could not remain in the portfolio. \n \nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment. \n \nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance. \n \nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected. \n \nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\". \n \n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" \n \nThe story Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019 first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Cessnock Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169693779","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Cessnock Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.cessnockadvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195934341","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:53Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Pete Ricketts and Ken Stinson. Her donor list also includes several Omaha construction and development-related companies. \n \nStothert said her $1.5 million fundraising total since the 2013 election exceeds her campaign\u2019s budget for the entire election. But she said she\u2019s not going to stop fundraising. \n \n\u201cI think it shows a lot of support, and I\u2019m very grateful for the people that donated to my campaign,\u201d she said. \n \nMello said he expects to spend about $1 million overall. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go still in this campaign, and we\u2019re working hard every single day to expand our support,\u201d he said. \n \nOf the money he\u2019s raised, almost $190,000 was carried over from his legislative campaign committee. \n \nMello said his support from the business community is an endorsement of his leadership style, saying donors are drawn to his consensus-building. \n \nBut Stothert said Mello\u2019s donors are simply an indication that she\u2019s had to say no to people \u2014 even potential donors \u2014 during her four years in office. \n \nAdkins, the political science professor, noted that there are still several months to go before the May 9 election. \n \nMello\u2019s business support \u201cdemonstrates that there is some interest in the business community in seeing a change in the mayor,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cHow much of an interest there is, we\u2019re still going to have to see. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at the point yet where we really know that.\u201d \n \nAdkins said donors don\u2019t like to give money to those who don\u2019t have a chance to win, so Mello\u2019s fundraising shows that donors believe he\u2019s a quality challenger. \n \nThe fundraising totals are good for Stothert too, Adkins said. He said it\u2019s a good sign for her that she\u2019s amassed a war chest of more than $890,000. \n \n\u201cIf an incumbent can raise a lot of money and they don\u2019t have to spend it, that\u2019s a pretty good sign,\u201d he said. \n \nThe campaigns\u2019 2016 year-end reports are due to be made public Tuesday, but the campaigns provided their figures to The World-Herald last week. Stothert filed her report Saturday. \n \nStothert\u2019s report includes all of her donations for the past year. \n \nDuring 2016, Mello ended his legislative campaign committee and formed a new committee for mayoral election fundraising. \n \nMany of Mello\u2019s top donors last year were Republican business leaders who have had high-profile clashes with Stothert. \n \nHe received $25,000 each from Omaha Performing Arts Chairman John Gottschalk and local businessman Dana Bradford. \n \nThere are no limits on the amount of campaign contributions in Nebraska state and local political races. \n \nBradford, executive chairman of Waitt Brands, declined to say why he donated to Mello. \n \nGottschalk, a former publisher of The World-Herald, said it\u2019s a contested election and he thinks Mello deserves support. \n \n\u201cAll the money is essentially to put him in a position where he\u2019d be competitive,\u201d Gottschalk said. \n \nHe declined to elaborate or say why he preferred Mello over Stothert. \n \nOther big-name businessman donors to Mello include Mike Yanney, who gave $16,000 and is the co-finance chair of the campaign, and Mike Cassling, who gave $5,000. \n \nA handful of donors gave to both, including Walter Scott, chairman emeritus of Peter Kiewit Sons\u2019 Inc., and Rod Yates and Frank Krejci, who are behind the potential redevelopment of Crossroads Mall. \n \nIn a statement, Yanney said he decided to support Mello to bring a new leadership style to City Hall. \n \nHe said Mello is \u201ca proven leader who has built consensus to pass balanced budgets and landmark legislation around economic development initiatives and public-private partnerships in the Nebraska Legislature.\u201d \n \nYanney, founder and chairman emeritus of the Burlington Capital Group, had previously donated to Mello\u2019s legislative campaigns. He did not return a phone message last week. \n \nMello said he attributes the support to \u201cour record of tackling big issues in the Legislature and helping make significant progress on economic development and public-private partnerships. That\u2019s given my candidacy much more broad appeal than people realize.\u201d \n \nStothert, though, attributed that support to the fact that she had denied requests from many of those business leaders. \n \nIn particular, regarding Gottschalk, Bradford, Cassling and Yanney, Stothert said she\u2019s had to make \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d and tell them no. \n \n\u201cWhen I made those decisions it was always in the best interest of the Omaha taxpayers,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the price of leadership.\u201d \n \nParticular disputes include: \n \n» Gottschalk was the chairman of OPA last year when the performing arts group asked the city to acquire three buildings near the Holland Performing Arts Center. That land would go to the arts group for future expansion, and the group would turn over a nearby parking lot to HDR Inc. for the company to build a new downtown headquarters. \n \nStothert agreed to direct the city to buy the buildings. But she declined to tear down the century-old buildings in order to make room for the expansion, which would have been unpopular with preservation groups and others. \n \nThe arts group backed out of its request for the buildings, and the deal to bring HDR downtown eventually fell apart. The company\u2019s headquarters will be in Aksarben Village instead. \n \n» Bradford served as the chairman of the Metropolitan Entertainment and Convention Authority, a nonprofit that oversees the city-owned CenturyLink Center and TD Ameritrade Park. Stothert was highly critical of MECA under Bradford\u2019s tenure, saying the group needed to release more information to the city about the facilities\u2019 operations. (Bradford gave Stothert\u2019s campaign $5,000 in 2013 after she took office.) \n \n» Cassling is a former top donor to Stothert, giving her $33,000 between 2012 and 2014. He heads an initiative to bring a multisport complex to the Omaha area. The facility was initially planned to be located in Tranquility Park. That deal fell apart, at least partly, Stothert said, because the group asked for $20 million in city money. The group pulled out of Omaha and later decided to build in La Vista. Cassling, who also serves on the OPA board, did not return a phone message last week. \n \n» Yanney\u2019s daughter, Lisa Roskens, is involved in the multisport project. Yanney and his wife, Gail, also led a campaign to raise money for what is now the Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center. As a council member, Stothert voted against a 3 percent tax on tobacco sales across the city to help fund the center, but the City Council ultimately approved the tax. \n \nStothert said she\u2019s received donations from well-known Democrats, including developer Jay Noddle and restaurateur Willy Theisen, both MECA board members, as well as John Kotouc, executive chairman of American National Bank. \n \nNoddle gave $10,000, according to her report, Kotouc gave $5,000, and Theisen gave $2,500. \n \nShe also received a $2,500 contribution from David Slosburg, another board member of OPA. \n \nMello said Kotouc gave his campaign $1,000 this month, which is after the deadline for this campaign finance report. \n \nAbout Mello\u2019s Republican donors, Stothert said: \u201cSome people aren\u2019t used to being told no. It\u2019s much easier to say yes. I still think the right answer was no in these cases. If they\u2019re angry about it, so be it.\u201d \n \nSaid Mello: \u201cI\u2019m the leading challenger who has a vision for the city, running against a mayor with no vision.\u201d \n \nroseann.moring@owh.com , 402-444-1084 \n  \n© 2017 Atchison Globe Now.

Organisers claim this a record number of the little dogs in the one place at the one time. \n\nMark Ellis, the organiser of Sunday's Werriwa Wiener Dash at the Bungendore Show, believes the turnout of 154 dachshunds for the event constitutes a world record for the number of the sausage dogs in one place at one time.\n\n\"We had miniatures, long hairs, short hairs, standards and wire hairs,\" he said. \"They came from all over; some even travelled from Melbourne.\n\nWhile Mr Ellis wasn't able to engage the attention of the people from Guinness, who ruled the record being sought was too \"specialised\" to interest them, he is happy to claim the record with any other contenders needing to prove him wrong.\n\nAlthough the quirky event, which has captured the imagination of dachshund lovers from across NSW and the ACT, is only in its second year it has already become one of the feature events of the Bungendore Show.\n\nThis year's dash winner was Buddy, owned by Jacqueline Winzenberg of Page in the ACT. Buddy's award was presented by NSW Deputy Premier and local member John Barilaro.\n\nOne hundred and twenty seven dogs turned up for the inaugural event in 2016.\n\nBungendore Show, which was first held in the 1840s, has gone from strength to strength in recent decades, this year's showgirl, Hanna Darmody, 22, said.\n\nMs Darmody, whose family own a Bungendore butchery, said she could recall helping with the catering at the show as a toddler almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"I've seen the event grow as the town has grown,\" she said. \"It is a great bridge between country and city; the showgirl competition is a good way to get young people involved and promotes opportunities in agriculture.\"\n\nShow organisers said this year's event, which enjoyed the best weather conditions in three years, was an unqualified success with more than 2000 people passing through the gates before lunch.\n\nIn addition to the usual attractions in the show ring and the pavilions and the dachshund dash, the 2017 event offered visitors a chance to get a close look at the Anzac Centennial 18 pounder gun.\n\nThe World War I-era weapon, which also saw service during World War II,was restored by the Royal Australian Artillery Company in conjunction with veteran coach builder Jim Frecklington.

She owns a comparatively humble semi at Northbridge, in her Willoughby electorate. Photo: Daniel Munoz \n    exit   \nSydney's booming spring property market has delivered the new Berejiklian government a budget windfall. \n \nThe amount of residential stamp duty flowing into the state coffers hit new monthly records in November and December, Office of State Revenue figures show. \n \nThe NSW government collected $730 million from the residential property transfers last month alone \u2013 about $100 million more than the previous December. November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier. \n \nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts. \n \nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July. \n \nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier. \n \nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016. \n \nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256. \n \nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years. \n \nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability. \n \nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\". \n \nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\". \n \nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year. \n \nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets. \n \nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16. \n \nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year. \n \nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion. \n \nThe story Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Cessnock Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169693779","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1"},"name":"Cessnock Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.cessnockadvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195938563","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2444","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Port Macquarie","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Port Macquarie News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"351643997","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"19"},"name":"Port Macquarie News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.portnews.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195939884","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:56Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

A lawsuit brought by states would heighten the legal stakes surrounding the president's executive order, signed late on Friday, as courtroom challenges to the ban have so far mostly been filed by individuals. \n \nOfficials in the offices of attorneys general in Pennsylvania, Washington and Hawaii said on Saturday they were evaluating what specific claims could be filed, and in which court. \n \n\"We do believe the executive order is unconstitutional,\" Hawaii attorney general Douglas Chin told Reuters on Saturday. He declined to give further detail. \n \nThe states could decide not to file, and it is unclear how many states would ultimately sign on for such an effort. \n \n\"There certainly are conversations underway,\" said Joe Grace, a spokesman for Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro. \n \nA Trump representative could not be reached immediately for comment. \n \nTrump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. He told reporters in the Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \"not a Muslim ban\" and said the measures were long overdue. \n \nHowever, his order hit a roadblock late on Saturday when a federal judge in New York said stranded travelers could stay in the country. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the emergency court order, said it would help 100 to 200 people with valid visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports after Trump signed the order. \n \nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it would comply with judicial orders but that Trump's immigration restrictions remained in effect. \n \n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Society news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US immigration news","group":"Society"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Lawsuits news","group":"Business"}],"title":"UPDATE 1-U.S. states discussing lawsuit over Trump immigration order","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"DNA India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659516","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1346"},"name":"DNA India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["News","Standard"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195940872","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:21:08Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

It is a goal of the ICC that every Full Member plays international bilateral cricket in their own country. But for us to do that, we need everyone to be safe and secure,? ESPNcricinfo quoted him as saying. \n \nPakistan have not hosted any international cricket tournaments since the terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore in 2009,when six Pakistani Policemen were killed and some of the visiting players were injured. \n \nThe Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was in talks with the MCC at the time for the latter to send a cricket team to Lahore, but the terror attack put an end to that. \n \n\"We don't want to get it wrong,\" Clarke said. \"We all know one terrible incident can push things backwards again. What happened here in one of Lahore's parks did make it impossible for us to send a team here last year. So we're hoping to move forward, but this isn't an easy road.? \n \nThe ICC official further said that there?s a considerable amount of perception that needs to be changed and information that needs to be shared. \n \n?But I am most impressed by the efforts of the authorities to make Lahore a safe city,? he asserted. \n \nThe Federation of International Cricketers Associations (FICA) has earlier this month advised players not to tour Pakistan due to an extremely elevated state of insecurity in the country. \n \nThe cricket federation, citing unnamed security consultants, had termed Pakistan as an unsafe place to play cricket. \n \nHowever, Clarke didn't comment on that statement, saying he hadn't discussed that statement with FICA, or read it in full. \n \n\"I was far more interested in coming here for myself before I opened that conversation,\" he said. \n \nThe West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) had also this month rejected the proposed tour to Pakistan after the security concerns raised by FICA. \n \n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Indian subcontinent news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Pakistan news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: cricket news","group":"Sports"}],"title":"ICC official urges caution in bringing international cricket back to Pakistan","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"DNA India","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169659516","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"1346"},"name":"DNA India","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.dnaindia.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195941037","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:23:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:55Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

And all would be subject to a 20 percent import tax proposed by the Trump administration last week as a means of paying for a border wall between the two nations. \n \nLike many in both countries, however, Jacobo wasn\u2019t quite sure how taxing imported goods to be sold to his U.S. consumers would add up to making Mexico and Mexican consumers pay for the wall, a campaign promise of President Donald Trump. \n \nRather than burdening Mexico, Jacobo said, such a tax collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials would end up being passed on to wholesalers in the United States, then to U.S. retailers and ultimately to his consumers. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s like any other price increase,\u201d said Jacobo, whose parents started the family grocery store 40 years ago. \u201cYou have to pass it on to the customer, or what\u2019s the point of being here?\u201d \n \nThe White House said last week that a 20 percent border tax on imports from Mexico is one method the Trump administration is considering to equalize a $60 billion trade deficit and to pay for a barrier between the two nations to control the entry of illegal immigrants, drugs and guns. \n \nA White House spokesman refused to detail exactly how taxing goods coming into the country \u2014 taxes surely to be passed on to U.S. consumers in the form of higher retail prices \u2014 would generate revenue from Mexico\u2019s government or consumers for the construction of a wall. \n \nSean Spicer, the spokesman, later appeared to backtrack, telling reporters that the tax was \u201cone idea\u201d to pay for the wall and that his intent was not to \u201croll out\u201d a new policy. Not all Republicans seemed to be on board, either: U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., posted on Twitter that \u201cTariffs are a tax on American families.\u201d Colleague Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called talk of an import tax \u201cmucho sad.\u201d \n \nSome economists last week also were scratching their heads at the idea. They included University of Nebraska at Omaha economist and professor Christopher Decker. \n \n\u201cUnless I\u2019m missing something, I\u2019m not quite sure how that works,\u201d Decker said. \u201cIf imports dry up as a result of the increase in tax, you\u2019re not going to have a lot of tax revenue.\u201d \n \nOn the other hand, if imports from Mexico remain high because consumers are willing to pay higher prices for valued goods, the people paying those higher prices are U.S. consumers. Instead of Mexico paying for the wall, Decker said, Americans who buy Mexican-made goods would be paying for the wall. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s backwards,\u201d Decker said. \u201cThat confounds me a little bit.\u201d \n \nIt\u2019s not just foodstuffs that are affected \u2014 many automobiles, some under American nameplates such as Chevrolet and Dodge \u2014 are assembled in Mexico. Presumably they also would be slapped with a 20 percent import tax as they made their way into the U.S \u2014 if automakers didn\u2019t find somewhere else to make the cars. \n \nThere apparently is some hope that threat of a tariff, or tax, on imports to the U.S. from Mexico could spur carmakers to bring some production back to the U.S. \n \nDennis Williams, president of the United Auto Workers, generally expressed support for Trump\u2019s idea of tariffs on Mexican imports, according to news reports after the November election. \n \nSuch support was in short supply among agricultural interests in the Midlands: Farmers and others connected to the ag industry said they had much to lose if talk of an import tax ignited a full-on trade war. \n \nMexico is Nebraska\u2019s second-largest trading partner, after Canada, with $1.2 billion in trade in 2015, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. \n \nMidlands ag folks were crystal clear Friday when they said they do not favor any U.S. trade policy that will lead Mexico to retaliate with punitive border levies of its own that might cut deeply into the ability of Nebraska and Iowa farmers to sell their grain profitably south of the border. \n \n\u201cAny disruption of export markets would result in continued downward pressure on farm incomes and farm financial health,\u201d said Steve Nelson, president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau. \n \n\u201cAgriculture exports account for roughly one-third of farm income,\u201d Nelson said, \u201cmaking trade critical to agriculture. Any actions jeopardizing Nebraska\u2019s ability to access international markets is of great concern to our members.\u201d \n \nThe leading categories are the usual suspects: processed food and grain. Mexico is the third-largest consumer of all U.S. agriculture goods, the second-largest consumer of U.S. corn, third of U.S. soybeans and fourth of U.S. beef. Nebraska, in turn, ranks in the top five nationally in the production of each, as does Iowa in corn and soybeans. \n \nMajor corporations with a stake in Mexico are monitoring the situation closely. In Omaha, that means Union Pacific Railroad, employer of 8,000 in Nebraska. The second-largest freight railroad in the United States, about 11 percent of U.P.\u2019s volume is tied to Mexico. The company serves all six of the rail crossings between the United States and Mexico. \n \n\u201cA big chunk is vehicles and vehicle parts going back and forth,\u201d Union Pacific marketing chief Beth Whited said in a conference call with analysts and investors this month. \n \nDaniel Sherman, a Wall Street transportation-industry analyst for St. Louis-based wealth adviser Edward Jones, said he doesn\u2019t see any long-term threat to Union Pacific from the Mexican standoff because, politics and rhetoric aside, there are people on both sides of the border with their heads on straight. And that means, Sherman said, a long-term agreement wherein both sides prosper because it is not in anyone\u2019s best interest for anything but. \n \n\u201cI see the current dust-up as the start of a long drawn-out negotiation process that likely ends better than it will look in the middle,\u201d Sherman said in an interview. \u201cThe reason it ends better is because both sides realize that each is benefiting in a major way from the trade between our two countries.\u201d \n \nOn the same conference call earlier this month, U.P. Chief Executive Lance Fritz said the economies of the two countries are inextricably tied. \n \n\u201cIt is our perception that the United States is tightly woven with our trading partners,\u201d Fritz said. \u201cOur consumers benefit greatly from free and open trade.\u201d \n \nSuch \u201cfree and open trade\u201d is generally considered to be that in which neither trading partner levies import taxes at the border, fees known as tariffs. Fritz said free trade benefits the United States by allowing imports of goods that can be produced more cheaply overseas than domestically. \n \nFree trade advocates say it also opens up exports, encouraging technological and productivity advances in U.S. manufacturing, and the concomitant job growth. \n \nThe opposite trading philosophy is known as \u201cprotectionism,\u201d in which hefty tariffs are levied at the border to make imported goods more expensive than those manufactured domestically, a strategy designed to protect domestic agriculture, industries and jobs from foreign competition. \n \nFor the Midwest, it is the ag portion that resounds the loudest. Corn is selling for less than half the $8 a bushel record seen in 2012, farm debt is up and land prices are declining. \n \n\u201cMexico has been an important and growing market for raw and processed agricultural goods,\u201d said John Campbell of Omaha investment bank Ocean Park Advisers, whose work includes commodities analysis. \u201cA trade war with them when farmers are already in a fragile financial situation would be disastrous for rural America.\u201d \n \nBack in South Omaha, Tony Vega\u2019s Plaza Latina at 4938 S. 24th St. carries a wide range of goods, including Mexican-made cowboy boots costing up to $850 a pair. Customers will balk at a 20 percent increase and may bargain down the price, cutting into the store\u2019s earnings. \n \nThe tax option is another negative message from the Trump administration, said Vega, who helps local people with travel plans and finding doctors or lawyers in Omaha. There\u2019s a fear that the federal government will track down people who aren\u2019t legal residents. \n \n\u201cThe most important thing is we want to be the best citizens we can be, respect the law, respect everything,\u201d Vega said. \u201cWe must be good neighbors. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d \n \nr ussell.hubbard@owh.com , 402-444-3133 \n \njordan@owh.com , 402-444-1080 \n Mexico is a big U.S. trading partner  \nMexico is our third-largest goods trading partner with $531 billion in total (two-way) goods trade during 2015, the last year with statistics available through the Office of the United States Trade Representative. \n Exports: $236 Billion  \nMexico is the United States\u2019 second-largest export partner, and it ranks third in U.S. agricultural products received at $18 billion. \n \nTop export categories (in billions) \n \n1.

Decked out in Reds jerseys, caps and shirts, fans brought items to be autographed and eagerly asked questions of pitcher Drew Storen, catcher Chris Okey, former outfielder Eric Davis, broadcasters Jeff Brantley and Jim Kelch, general manager Dick Williams and owner Bob Castellini during the two-hour session. \n   \nOne fan identified himself only by his first name and his banter with Davis, the star centerfielder on the 1990 Reds World Series championship team, had the crowd boisterously laughing. \n   \n\"Mr. Davis, I'm Roscoe,\" the fan said. \n   \n\"Right on, Roscoe,\" Davis said. \n   \n\"I remember when the Reds traded you to the Dodgers,\" Roscoe said. \n   \n\"You didn't have to bring that up,\" Davis responded. \n   \nDavis was the hit of the Caravan lineup as fans reminisced about Cincinnati's 4-0 sweep of the the heavily favored Oakland Athletics in the 1990 Fall Classic. Davis homored off A's ace Dave Stewart in his first at bat of the series and the Reds won the game 7-0. \n   \n\"I still haven't come down,\" Davis said of his massive blast to center field at Riverfront Stadium. \"It was great, but I enjoy it more now than I did at the time because when you're playing, you're playing for such high stakes and you really don't enjoy it as much when it happens.\" \n   \nOakland was the defending world champion and making its third consecutive appearance in the World Series in 1990. The \"Bash Brothers\" Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco led the A's. That season the two combined to hit 76 home runs. Oakland featured a batting champion in third baseman Carney Lansford, a Hall of Famer in center field in Rickey Henderson and a one-two starting pitching punch of Stewart and and Bob Welch, who combined to go 49-15. Relief ace Dennis Eckersley saved 48 games as the A's went 99-63 before sweeping Boston 4-0 in the American League Championship Series. \n   \nCincinnati took a 91-71 record into the World Series and had beaten the Pittsburgh Pirates 4 games to 2 in the National League Championship Series. The national media predicted a sweep, but not by the Reds. \n   \n\"Nobody in green and gold gave us a chance,\" Davis said of the A's. \"All of us in red knew we were going to whip their (tail).\" \n   \nOne of those who was convinced the Reds would beat Oakland was Cincinnati scout Gene Bennett, a Wheelersburg native who put together the scouting report on the A's. Bennett attended Saturday's Caravan stop and grinned as Davis recalled the shocking triumph. \n   \nDavis is a Reds legend, but he said there was a time he didn't like the team. A native of Los Angeles, where he grew up with former New York Mets great Daryl Strawberry, Davis went to two Dodgers games in person and both were against the Reds. Davis said he didn't like what he saw from the powerful Big Red Machine of the 1970s. \n   \n\"They wore all black shoes,\" Davis said, wearing his familiar No. 44 jersey. \"They had no insignia or color or stripe on them. I was sitting way up high, but I could see the insignia on the Dodgers shoes, but nothing on the Reds. I didn't like that. I thought, I don't want to play for those guys.\" \n   \nThe comments drew laughter, which continued as Davis said because of the shoes he was upset he was drafted by the Reds in 1980. His attitude quickly changed once he went to spring training in 1981. \n   \n\"We trained at Al Lopez Field in Tampa,\" Davis said. \"Sometime the big league guys would come down to the minor league games. We didn't have all the jerseys and stuff you have today. They'd come down in their game uniforms and they were the whitest white and the reddest red. I just loved them. I told myself i was going to wear that uniform some day.\" \n   \nWear it, he did. Davis spent nine of his 17 seasons with Cincinnati and retired after the 2001 season. For his career, Davis hit 282 home runs, drove in 934 run, batted .269, reached base at a .359 clip and slugged .482. Davis stole 349 bases and won 10 gold gloves.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"TIM STEPHENS"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: MLB - Oakland Athletics news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: MLB - Cincinnati Reds news","group":"Sports Teams"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Eric Davis is the hit of Reds Caravan visit in Ashland","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cabell","zipCode":"25720","state":"West Virginia","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Huntington","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Herald Dispatch","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169660438","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Herald Dispatch","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.herald-dispatch.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195943757","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:01:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/herald-dispatch.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/2d/52d4b2f7-4b9e-5b6d-87e5-a8c5b54f8e5a/588d664581e48.image.jpg?resize=300%2C211"}],"video":[]}}

This year Courtney was wrestling 132 pounds while Murin was at 138, with each ranked No. 1 in their respective weights.  \n \nRather than look for an easy path to a title, Courtney contacted the 2015 state champ and asked if Murin would mind if he came up to 138 for another potential match \u2013 their fourth in less than a year. \n \nMurin was happy to oblige. \n \n\u201cI think it definitely makes the sport of wrestling better,\u201d Murin said. \u201cNowadays, everybody\u2019s running away from competition. Maybe in the state tournament it\u2019s OK to run \u2013 I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s OK to run \u2013 but in these small tournaments, I think it\u2019s awesome that these high-caliber guys wrestle each other.\u201d \n \nThe capacity crowd at Bedford High School seemed to think so, too. The match was held until the very end of the tournament and few fans left early. The crowd was into the bout from the start, which Murin noticed, even his hyper-focused state. \n \n\u201cEvery time someone took a shot, the fans went crazy, which is awesome for the sport of wrestling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an exciting match, and it was nice having that commentary in the back.\u201d \n \nAfter a scoreless first period, Murin escaped in the second, and after letting one potential takedown slip away, he scored with about 15 seconds remaining for a 3-0 lead. \n \nMurin said he relied on his previous matches \u2013 including a summer victory over Courtney in Orlando, Florida \u2013 to know how to score. \n \n\u201cI took him down with a low double twice \u2013 I took him down here last year and took him down at Disney,\u201d Murin said. \u201cI knew if I hit it nice, it was going to work.\u201d \n \nCourtney escaped in the third, but couldn\u2019t score a tying takedown. Still, he had no regrets about his decision to move up, which resulted in just the sixth loss of his stellar career. \n \n\u201cThat was what I wanted,\u201d Courtney said of the match. \u201cObviously that\u2019s not the result I wanted, but it was definitely an awesome match. Six minutes of hard, hard wrestling, which is always what we get when we wrestle, and that\u2019s what I love.\u201d \n \nChestnut Ridge wrestlers were doing what they love as well \u2013 scoring points and winning titles. \n \nJustin McCoy (145), Morgan Deremer (160) and Jared McGill (170) each won crowns for Lions. \n \n\u201cThey preach to all of our other guys, turn it into a game,\u201d coach Greg Lazor said of his big three.  \n \n\u201cSometimes we lose the fun out of the sport because of the grind. They preach go out there and try to score. If you get taken down, who cares? Get away and get yours then.\u201d \n \nThe trio did plenty of that. \n \nMcCoy built a 13-2 lead before pinning Gage Cannavino of Athens in the finals. The junior had a fall, a technical fall and a major decision on his way to the finals. \n \nMcGill had a pin and two technical falls before reaching the finals, where he beat Athens\u2019 Nate Bradley 10-0. \n \nDeremer, the lone senior among the three, beat Penn Cambria\u2019s Derek Brown 5-0 for his title. \n \n\u201cIt was a good tournament,\u201d Deremer said. \u201cIt was something I wanted to win, being my senior year and something I hadn\u2019t won yet.\u201d \n \nThe Lions easily outdistanced second-place Athens, 212-158. \n \n\u201cIt really came down to our guys in the losers\u2019 bracket just working their tails off,\u201d Deremer said. \u201cIt may not seem as fun in the losers\u2019 bracket, but that\u2019s where tournaments are won and lost. You can lose a match and be down about it and go out and lose another and you don\u2019t do anything for your team. Or you can battle. That\u2019s what Coach says, \u2018When you lose, you become the most important kid on the team, and you\u2019ve go to work and fight for each and every point.\u2019 \u201c \n \nA good example of that was Austin Crouse. The 195-pounder entered the tournament with a 4-6 record. He went 6-2 on the weekend with five falls, which resulted in big bonus points for the Lions. \n \n\u201cHe had a great tournament,\u201d Lazor said. \u201cHe really stepped it up. Started wrestling with a little bit of confidence. He showed a lot of heart. I\u2019m extremely proud of him.\u201d \n \nSomerset\u2019s Austin Hemminger was the only other local wrestler to make the finals. He dropped an 8-6 decision to Kaidon Winters of Athens at 152 pounds. \n \nOther champions include: Mount Union\u2019s Josh Boozel (106) and Jake Ryan (220), Athens\u2019 A.J. Burkhart (113), Burrell\u2019s Trent Bechtold (120), Jefferson-Morgan\u2019s Gavin Teasdale (126), Everett\u2019s Liam Flaherty (132), Beth-Center\u2019s Dominic Fundy (182), North Schuylkill\u2019s Brady Mickatavage (195) and Freedom\u2019s Evan Sweesy (285).","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Eric Knopsnyder eknopsnyder@tribdem.com"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"WATCH: Murin beats defending state champ, Chestnut Ridge wins Thomas Tournament title","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cambria","zipCode":"15907","state":"Pennsylvania","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Johnstown","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Tribune-Democrat","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"501849262","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"12"},"name":"Tribune-Democrat","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.tribdem.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195945271","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T03:59:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:25:59Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/tribdem.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/fd/afddedfc-e5d7-11e6-b6ca-dfa69a591670/588d69817cc80.image.jpg?resize=300%2C199"}],"video":[]}}

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n \n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n \n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n \nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n \n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n \n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\" \n \n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Sheboygan","zipCode":"53081","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Sheboygan","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WHBL","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"545894284","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5"},"name":"WHBL","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://whbl.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195951389","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:00Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Seeing your house full of clutter can affect your mood negatively and make your personal space seem like a place you want to escape from, rather than something to look forward to coming home to. Organize a \"throwing out\" day every month to make sure that you don't have clutter building up. Here are some things you should consider purging from your home, and download our printable to help you get rid of items you don't need! \n 1. Old magazines  \nGet rid of old magazines you have lying around because chances are, you aren't going to read them again. Find places where you can donate your magazines to such as child care centers, doctor's offices, nail salons, nursing homes, and libraries. If there's an article that really speaks to you, scan a digital image of it and keep it in your computer. Or keep a folder of magazine clippings if you like saving magazine articles. \n 2. Receipts, bills, and documents  \nThrow away receipts for items that you aren't planning on returning, and ones that you won't need to use come tax time. If you're wary of throwing away receipts, you can make a digital copy of them with a scanner or a smartphone app ($6). See here for a full list of documents you should keep forever or temporarily. \n 3. Clothes  \nUse the two-year-rule for clothes \u2014 get rid of apparel that you haven't worn in two years. Sell them to a thrift store or donate them to the needy. \n 4. Books  \nGo through your bookshelf and gather together books you haven't touched in months and ones that you aren't planning on rereading. Be realistic and make sure you're ruthless. If you haven't touched it in a year, you're most likely not going to read it again. Sell the books on Amazon, Craigslist, or eBay. You can even trade them for something else on Sell Buy Swap . You can always donate them as well! \n 5. Medicine and vitamins  \nTake a look at your medicine closet and clear out drugs that have expired, medicine that has sat on your shelf for too long, or ones that you no longer use. First, check to see what the proper disposal methods are for the medication, and if you can't find any, check to see if your community has a drug take-back program. If there isn't a program near you, then the Department of Health mixing medicine with \"used coffee grounds or kitty litter\" in a container or sealable bag before throwing it away to make the drugs less appealing. \n 6. Makeup and perfume  \nGo through your beauty cabinet and get rid of makeup that's too old or that you don't use. There are programs out there that let you recycle your makeup, such as MAC, which has a program that lets you exchange six empty containers for a new eyeshadow, lip gloss, or lipstick. POPSUGAR Beauty has a neat list of when to throw away cosmetics. \n 7. Jewellery  \nGo through your jewellery and dispose of the broken costume jewellery and make plans to sell ones that you don't wear. For fine jewellery, look up appraisers from the National Association of Jewellery Appraisers . Once you have a quoted price, shop around at auction houses, estate buyers, pawnshops, and jewelers to see if you can find a better deal. \n 8. Food  \nGo through your pantry and fridge and clear out items that need to be thrown out \u2014 the old, unused, and rotting. Do this weekly instead of monthly, just to make sure you don't have any unpleasant surprises! \n 9. Some memorabilia  \nMany organising experts advise to be ruthless and throw away memorabilia like cards and gifts you don't use. I agree, but I think you can keep some of them by perhaps creating some sort of poster with old cards or designating a small shoe box for memorabilia. Resolve to throw away anything that can't fit into the box. \n 10. Notebooks  \nI don't know about you, but I have a lot of notebooks lying around. Take a look at them and throw out the ones that you no longer need. My notebooks are filled with notes from classes I take and notes from meetings. \n 11. Old or unused electronics  \nHave an electric piano you don't use? Or maybe you just never got around to getting rid of your old laptop or mobile. Sell your electronics on sites like Boomerang Buy Back . These sites are great because they'll quote you a price for the item you wish to sell. You can also sell it on sites such as Craigslist and eBay. \n \nImage Source: POPSUGAR Photography","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Emily Co"},"topics":[{"name":"Consumer: recipes","group":"Lifestyle"}],"title":"11 Things You Need to Throw Away","source":{"category":"Journal","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"PopSugar Australia","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169730121","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"97"},"name":"PopSugar Australia","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Recreation","Recipes"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.popsugar.com.au"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://media4.popsugar-assets.com/files/docs/SmartLiving-11ThingsThrowAway-print.pdf","https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/jotnot-scanner/id307868751?mt=8","http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/nmp-prescribers-return.htm","http://www.najaappraisers.com/html/find_an_appraiser.php"],"sequenceId":"695195960048","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:00:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:05Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

I keep them in storage.\u201d\n\nAsked by Kirsty if it competes with Victoria\u2019s shoe collection he replied: \u201cIt does actually.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about the current child sex abuse scandal in football, David said: \u201cThere was never anything at Manchester United and it is disgraceful what has gone on and there has to be something done about it.\n\n\u201cThe closest part would have been certain professionals that if we had gone out of line they would have made us do a funny dance in the middle of the changing room in front of the professionals, in front of our heroes at the time.\u201d\n\nDavid said it was humiliating, adding: \u201cThat was all it was, but that was just to teach us a lesson, there was never any wrong-doing.\u201d\n\nThe ex-footballer\u2019s eight-disc choices included Every Time We Say Goodbye by Ella Fitzgerald, I Am The Resurrection by the Stone Roses and Si Tu Vois Ma Mere by Sidney Bechet.\n\nHis luxury item was his England caps and his book was the cookery book On Fire by Francis Mallmann.\n\nDesert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15am.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Entertainment: latest","group":"Entertainment"}],"title":"Posh and Becks used to date in a Harvester car park","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"Somerset","zipCode":"BA1","state":"England","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Bath and North East Somerset","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"This is the West Country","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169663569","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"This is the West Country","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Arts","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk","publisher":"Newsquest Media Group"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195961662","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:02:55Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:08Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk/resources/images/5939725/"}],"video":[]}}

A lawsuit brought by states would heighten the legal stakes surrounding the president's executive order, signed late on Friday, as courtroom challenges to the ban have so far mostly been filed by individuals.\n\nOfficials in the offices of attorneys general in Pennsylvania, Washington and Hawaii said on Saturday they were evaluating what specific claims could be filed, and in which court.\n\n\"We do believe the executive order is unconstitutional,\" Hawaii attorney general Douglas Chin told Reuters on Saturday. He declined to give further detail.\n\nThe states could decide not to file, and it is unclear how many states would ultimately sign on for such an effort.\n\n\"There certainly are conversations underway,\" said Joe Grace, a spokesman for Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro.\n\nA Trump representative could not be reached immediately for comment.\n\nTrump, a businessman who successfully tapped into American fears about terror attacks during his campaign, had promised what he called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants and refugees from areas the White House said the U.S. Congress deemed to be high risk. He told reporters in the Oval Office on Saturday that his order was \"not a Muslim ban\" and said the measures were long overdue.\n\nHowever, his order hit a roadblock late on Saturday when a federal judge in New York said stranded travelers could stay in the country. The American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the emergency court order, said it would help 100 to 200 people with valid visas or refugee status who found themselves detained in transit or at U.S. airports after Trump signed the order.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it would comply with judicial orders but that Trump's immigration restrictions remained in effect.

Dozens civilians died and got injured in the combat actions in Syria\u2019s Deir-ez-Zor, seized by the Islamic State militants (outlawed in Russia) the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a weekly report, published on Saturday. \n \n\"Fighting between ISIL and Government of Syria (GoS) forces is currently concentrated in the Al-Ommal and Rasafa neighbourhoods, the Al-Baglieh area and west of Deir-ez-Zor airbase\" the report reads. \"Medical sources inside the besieged city reported 19 civilian deaths and at least 44 civilian injuries due to shelling between 15 and 23 January.\" \n \nBesides, OCHA wrote in the report about \"unconfirmed reports from local sources that 40 bodies of under 15-year-olds were discovered in the areas where the clashes between ISIL and the GoS took place. If confirmed, this would substantiate allegations that ISIL is recruiting children for active combat.\" \n \n\"Urgent medical evacuations are required for at least 97 civilians who are in critical condition. Due to insufficient medical resources and the ongoing fighting, the number of people in need of medical evacuations is expected to rise,\" the report says. \n \n\"Inside Deir-ez-Zor city, generators remain the only source of electricity as fuel is scarce, but they are only being used to supply civilian infrastructure, such as hospitals, water networks and bakeries. Water continues to be pumped into Deir-ez-Zor once per week as per standard practice. In Harabesh people depend mainly on the river water which they can only access at night because ISIL is in control of the opposite river bank. While having to fetch water in proximity to ISIL controlled territory is an obvious protection concern, the consumption of untreated water from the river also exposes residents of Harabesh to the risk of water-borne diseases.\" \n \n\"The area of Deir-ez-Zor city under government control has been besieged by ISIL since July 2014, depriving up to 93,500 people from regular access to food and medicines,\" OCHA said. \"An ISIL offensive on Deir-ez-Zor that started on 15 January has effectively cut the besieged enclave in two as of 17 January. This cut resulted in the separation of the Deir-ez-Zor airport and the two eastern neighborhoods (Harabesh and Alrasafa) populated by an estimated 6,000 people from the western neighborhoods, where the bulk of the city\u2019s 93,500 population live.\" \n \nThe report says the Syrian government continues delivering to the sieged regions small supplies of food, most of which is for the servicemen fighting against the Islamic State militants. \n \nThe UN also reported the delivery of bread and other products to Deir-ez-Zor, organized by the Russian Aerospace Force on January 17 and 18. \n   \n{{item.group_date}} \n  \nShow more","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Finance latest","group":"Finance"},{"name":"Syria news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Middle East news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"UN reports dozens killed, injured in Syrian Deir-ez-Zor","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Eastern Europe","countryCode":"RU","country":"Russia"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Tass.ru","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"550757895","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"77106"},"name":"Tass.ru","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Financials","Professional","Business"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://tass.ru"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195972912","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:17:41Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

TCU would claw its way back in the closing minutes to cut the deficit to single digits, but by then there was simply not enough time left on the clock for the Frogs to avoid their fourth straight loss. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re on a slide here and we\u2019ve got to go figure it out,\u201d TCU head coach Jamie Dixon said. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed and there\u2019s no other way to put it.\u201d \n \nFour TCU players finished the night with double-digit points, including a 19 point performance from forward Vladimir Brodziansky and 20 points from guard Alex Robinson. That however wouldn\u2019t offset a night that saw the Frogs shoot just 45 percent from the line and 25 percent from downtown (5-20). \n \n\u201cI\u2019m just very disappointed by how we played,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cAuburn had a big loss the other night and they responded and I thought we\u2019d do the same thing with our level, and we didn\u2019t do it.\u201d \n \nWith that, we evaluate what went wrong for the Frogs, who fell to 14-7 on the season. \n \nFree-Throw Free Fall \n \nFor all the struggles the Frogs had Saturday night, TCU\u2019s inability to make shots at the line may have been the most staggering, only draining 9-of-20 attempts for a dismal 45 percent. Considering Auburn only shot 60 percent at the line themselves, the 11 points lost in missed free throws only sting that much more. \n \n\u201cThat weighed on us,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cInterestingly enough we didn\u2019t shoot it very well in shoot around earlier. We had to shoot them a little more and we didn\u2019t make them, and it carried over.\u201d \n \nThe inability for TCU to cash in off of fouls comes as a bit of a surprise too, considering the Frogs shot 91 percent from the line in their loss to Oklahoma State in Stillwater earlier in the week. The Frogs have had their struggles with free throws before, but that doesn\u2019t take away the shock from tonight given how polar opposite TCU\u2019s performance at the line was last time around. \n \nFoul trouble and beyond \n \nTCU guard Kenrich Williams fouled out with a considerable amount of time remaining in the second half Saturday night, a considerable loss for the Frogs, and that was just a fraction of the 23 fouls that TCU committed in the loss. Auburn was only able to cash in for 12 points off those fouls, but the Frogs\u2019 giveaways and inability to get defensive rebounds and hit three pointers came at a cost, as Auburn recorded 19 points off turnovers and 20 on second point chances, opposed to TCU\u2019s mere nine points off offensive rebounds. \n \n\u201cWe gave them layups, we couldn\u2019t guard the dribble, and we gave them possessions with rebounds,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cOur 18 turnovers were 18 bad turnovers. I didn\u2019t think it was possible that we could turn it over 18 times.\u201d \n \nDixon added that the hefty amount of missed shots, 31 to be exact, also contributed to a lack of focus among the players. \n \n\u201cWhen we miss shots it effects everything we do,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cIt filtered into the free throws and now we\u2019re looking at our stats feeling sorry for ourselves. We\u2019ve got to look at ourselves and get more stuff done in practice.\u201d \n \nThe second half slump \n \nIt\u2019s a pattern that one can\u2019t help but overlook: The Frogs have developed a tendency in this skid to squander small late-game leads, typically via a large run for the opponent. Last Saturday against Baylor, it was an 8-0 run when TCU led by one with less than five minutes to play. In Stillwater on Monday, a late four-point lead vanished when Oklahoma State went on a 12-2 run. And tonight was the whopper, as TCU\u2019s 57-55 lead vanished for good when the Tigers went on a 26-2 run to put TCU down 21 points before the Frogs finally found some momentum when it was too late. \n \n\u201cObviously the run broke it open but I never felt good about what we were doing defensively,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cIt was a sign of things to come.\u201d \n \nA domino effect? \n \nWhile TCU has made tremendous strides when it comes to success in the grand scheme of things, the Frogs are in unchartered territory this season as they sit on a season-high four-game losing streak after tonight. What\u2019s noticeable is that each loss has seemingly been uglier than the last one, whether it be the ending of the game or the overall effort. \n \n\u201cEverybody goes through a bad stretch and honestly this was the worst one of the four from how we played,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cThe other losses, which were road losses to teams with high RPIs are okay, but this is a home loss, and it will put us back. \n \nDixon said Saturday\u2019s lackluster performance may have been a matter of losses and poor shooting catching up to the team \u2013 a domino effect in all essence. \n \n\u201cWhen we shoot the ball there\u2019s just not the same feeling right now and I feel like it\u2019s passing on to other things,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cYou can just feel the shoulders dropping and heads going down and it\u2019s four games straight. Our shooting percentages from then to now is a pretty big differential.\u201d \n \nWhether it be shooting, a lack of confidence or both, the Frogs hope they can find the cure sooner than later as Big 12 play continues this next week. \n \nUp Next \n \nNormal 0 false false false EN-US JA X-NONE \n \nThe Frogs\u2019 next chance to get back in the win column will be Wednesday night, as the team heads up to Manhattan, Kansas to take on the Kansas State Wildcats (15-6). Tip-off at the Fred Bramlage Coliseum is set for 6:30 p.m. CDT.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Dean Straka"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: US college sports news","group":"Sports"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Auburn: 88  TCU: 80","source":{"category":"Consumer","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Travis","zipCode":"78759","state":"Texas","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Austin","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Scout.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169658525","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Scout.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Local","Geographic","Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.scout.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195973082","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T03:12:17Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:15Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://img.scout.com/sites/default/files/2017/01/28/fisher.jpg?w=620&h=413&fit=max&format=jpg"}],"video":[]}}

We are asking kids to bring in their science fair projects and present them to us. In other words the children will be the teachers and the librarians will be the students! We hope to learn a lot from the kids, and maybe get to do some experiments as well. If your child would like to bring the presentation ahead of time, we will find a place to put them. This will be one of the most fun programs to date, we think. The more the merrier, so if there are middle school students who would like to present, they are more than welcome to come.

Statistics showed that he did not enter the opposing penalty area during the game. \n \n\u201cThere's no need to worry about Karim, he's having a great season.

He can come to Belfast.\" \n \nFloyd Mayweather Junior was here at his former home, along with the great and good of Britain and Northern Ireland, including David Haye, Amir Khan, George Groves, James Nesbitt and Northern Ireland boss Michael O'Neill. \n \nFrampton came out low at the start of the first to make himself an even smaller target for the taller and ranger Santa Cruz, but was still picked off by the Mexican's jab. \n  \nCarl Frampton v Leo Santa Cruz II \n   View gallery    \nSanta Cruz was disciplined and was keeping out of Frampton's shorter range, making it hard for the champion to fire off any shots. \n \nFrampton had some success on the inside in the third, but it was proving to be tough going for the Ulsterman. \n \nSanta Cruz was giving as good as he was getting in the close exchanges and Frampton slipped at the end of the fourth as he back-pedalled out of trouble. \n \nSanta Cruz was outpunching and outlanding Frampton and the champ was falling behind on the scorecards. \n \nThe thousands of Irish fans among the 10,085 crowd inside the MGM Grand Garden Arena did their best to lift their man and Santa Cruz was in control. \n    Carl's wife Christine at ringside to watch the fight  \nThe skirmishes, when Frampton did manage to get inside of Santa Cruz's jab, were inconclusive and he needed to do something to change the tempo of the fight. \n \nFrampton was only having isolated successes when he came inside and by the end of the eighth, Santa Cruz had outlanded him by nearly two to one. \n \nFrampton finally did better in the ninth and landed more frequently on Santa Cruz, who had slowed down, carrying on this good work in the 10th. \n \nThe pair embraced at the start of the 12th in a sign of their mutual respect before Frampton went all out in a sign that he knew he was behind. \n \nIt was not enough and in the end judges Dave Moretti and Glenn Feldman scored the contest 115-113 for Santa Cruz, while Burt Clements saw it as a draw 114-114.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Chris Sherrard"},"topics":[{"name":"Las Vegas news","group":"US regional"},{"name":"US news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Northern Ireland news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Carl Frampton beaten by Leo Santa Cruz in Las Vegas","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Europe","subregion":"Northern Europe","county":"County Antrim","zipCode":"BT4","state":"Northern Ireland","countryCode":"GB","zipArea":"Belfast","country":"United Kingdom"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Belfast Live","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"546273972","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"46"},"name":"Belfast Live","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Sports","Consumer"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.belfastlive.co.uk"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195982113","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:41:45Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://i1.belfastlive.co.uk/incoming/article12522935.ece/ALTERNATES/s338b/pe_00662828.jpg#ICID=nsm"}],"video":[]}}

We get in the post to Ethan and he\u2019s a great player and made the right reads.\u201d \n \nHapp was the only player for the Badgers (18-3, 7-1 Big Ten) to shoot above 50 percent (12-for-18) and the team finished at 33.3 percent for the game (20-for-60) including 3-for-25 from 3-point range. \n \nCorey Sanders had 15 points for the Scarlet Knights (12-10, 1-8), who lost for the ninth time in 10 games. \n \nThe Badgers, who have won 14 of their last 15 games, remained tied for first in the Big Ten with No. 22 Maryland, which won 85-78 at Minnesota on Saturday. \n \nWisconsin struggled with its shooting but the Badgers made six of their seven shots in the overtime. \n \n\u201cWe had to find other ways to win besides scoring,\u201d Wisconsin coach Greg Gard said. \u201cThe maturity of this group was evident. They didn\u2019t panic in the huddles. Credit our guys for the way they gutted it out defensively.\u201d \n \nThey took the lead for good on a reverse by Happ on which he was fouled. He missed the free throw but corralled it and laid it in for a 51-48 lead with 2:42 to play. \n \nBoth the field goal percentage and 3-point percentage were season lows for Wisconsin. \n \n\u201cI thought their defense had an extra gear tonight,\u201d Koenig said of Rutgers. He finished 2 of 13 from the field including 2 of 10 from 3-point range. \n \nRutgers finished with a 44-41 rebound advantage but the Scarlet Knights committed 19 turnovers that turned into 17 points for the Badgers. \n \n\u201cWith them it\u2019s pick your poison,\u201d Rutgers coach Steve Pikiell said. \u201cThey have the 3-point shooters and they have Happ inside. \n \n\u201cWe\u2019re getting there,\u201d the first-year coach said. \u201cWe have to figure out a way to win down the stretch and make that big bucket.\u201d \n \nNotes \n \nThe Badgers were making their third appearance at the current Madison Square Garden. They split two games last season. ... Nigel Hayes is the only player in Division I to accumulate 1,600 points, 650 rebounds and 250 assists. He is third highest active scorer behind Bryce Alford of UCLA and Josh Hart of Villanova. Hayes had seven points, 11 rebounds and four assists on Saturday. ... The Scarlet Knights were making their 100th appearance in the current Madison Square Garden and they have a 45-55 record. They won their earlier appearance this season, beating Fordham 68-53. ... Rutgers\u2019 last win over a ranked opponent was a 67-62 victory over then-No. 4 Wisconsin on Jan. 11, 2015. ... The Badgers men\u2019s hockey team beat Ohio State 3-2 in overtime on Saturday night. This was the second time the Big Ten hosted a basketball-hockey doubleheader at Madison Square Garden.

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services. She remains minister for the prevention of domestic violence.\n\nVeteran Liberal MP Brad Hazzard will move from family and community services to health following Jillian Skinner's decision to quit politics after being told she could not remain in the portfolio.\n\nCronulla MP Mark Speakman, a senior barrister, moves from environment to attorney-general, replacing Vaucluse MP Gabrielle Upton who takes over environment.\n\nMs Upton has also been handed the challenging local government portfolio amid unrest over forced mergers including from Woollahra Council in her electorate. Victor Dominello moves from innovation and better regulation to finance.\n\nAndrew Constance remains Transport and Infrastructure Minister and Deputy Liberal leader Dominic Perrottet will move from finance to become treasurer as expected.\n\nOpposition leader Luke Foley said the reshuffle \"is not about serving the interests of the people of NSW\".\n\n\"It's about serving the interests of the backroom operators and lurk merchants of the Liberal Party to whom Ms Berejiklian is beholden to.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Sean Nicholls"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Politics latest","group":"Society"}],"title":"Cabinet shakeup as Gladys Berejiklian resets for 2019","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2567","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Narellan","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Macarthur Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169754919","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Macarthur Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.macarthuradvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195983577","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:48Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:18Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/fb29f073-02ed-46ee-9fcb-a76504dad85e.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

November's total of $718 million was up by $123 million compared with a year earlier.\n\nThe results reversed a mid-year slump in the state's stamp duty receipts.\n\nTurnover was very strong in the final quarter of the year. Stamp duty was paid on 21,239 residential transfers across NSW in December, which was 31 per cent higher than in July.\n\nThe average stamp duty received per transaction in December was $34,385 \u2013 around $2100 more than the corresponding month a year earlier.\n\nThe strong stamp duty figures suggest Sydney's property market defied predictions of a slow-down and picked up pace in late 2016.\n\nFigures released by the Domain Group last Tuesday showed Sydney's median house price jumped 4.7 per cent in last three months of the year to reach $1.124 million. The city's median unit prices rose nearly 3 per cent in the quarter to $711,256.\n\nDomain's measure of Sydney's median house price has risen by 69 per cent \u2013 or $450,000 \u2013 in the past four years.\n\nWhile the end-of-year surge in stamp duty will bolster the state's already healthy bottom line, the figures also underscore how difficult it will be for the new Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to improve housing affordability.\n\nAt her first press conference as Premier last week Ms Berejiklian vowed to address the housing affordability crisis, declaring it \"the biggest issue people have across the state\".\n\nShe said specific policies to deal with this challenge would be outlined \"in the near future\".\n\nStamp duty revenue will get a further boost in coming months as a new surcharge on the stamp duty paid by foreign investors comes into effect. The surcharge was introduced in the June 2016 state budget but revenue from the new measure is not expected until early this year.\n\nSydney's four-year housing boom has helped deliver the state government a massive increase in the transfer duty levies on the transfer of property and other assets.\n\nIn 2011-12, just before the boom began, the government received $3.8 billion in transfer duty but that had swelled to nearly $9 billion by 2015-16.\n\nResidential stamp duty alone accounted for about 9 per cent of the state government's revenue last financial year.\n\nThe half-yearly review of the NSW budget, released last month, lifted the forecast for the state's budget surplus for this financial year by about $300 million to $4 billion.\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Matt Wade"},"topics":[{"name":"Oceania latest","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Australia news","group":"Regional"}],"title":"Boom bolsters Berejiklian's bottom line","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","zipCode":"2567","state":"New South Wales","countryCode":"AU","zipArea":"Narellan","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"Macarthur Advertiser","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169754919","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"2"},"name":"Macarthur Advertiser","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","Local"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.macarthuradvertiser.com.au","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195989404","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T06:59:37Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:17Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/e3c18faa-fe37-48b4-bad2-520457875b09.jpg/r2_0_728_410_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg"}],"video":[]}}

But generally speaking it\u2019s already set for the whole season.\u201d \n \nMouratoglou said numbers alone were not the main factor behind Serena's continuing hunger, even in her 20th year on tour. \n \n\"She was not motivated by 22, she was motivated to win grand slams,\" he said. \n \n\"That\u2019s her motivation. This won\u2019t change until she maybe one day wakes up and is not motivated to win grand slams, but for now she is. That\u2019s enough. The record is not the thing that makes her play.\" \n \nAnd Mouratoglou said Serena would not obsess over the record of 24 held by Court. \n \n\"With all the respect for Margaret Court, it was another era, the draws were like 16 players and they were not professionals,\" he said. \n \n\"Of course the record is here and we definitely want to beat it, but there was a professional era and the record was Steffi Graf.\" \n \n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Serena to play fewer tournaments to aid grand slam quest","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Marathon","zipCode":"54403","state":"Wisconsin","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Wausau","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"4","name":"WSAU-AM","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"203702183","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"20"},"name":"WSAU-AM","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.wsau.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695195990830","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T07:13:51Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:20Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

He found a county government job and settled in Long Beach with his wife and children. \n \nThis weekend, Rawi\u2019s 69-year-old father, a retired civil engineer who lives in Baghdad, was scheduled to arrive for a long-awaited visit. But those plans were abruptly upended Friday when President Trump on Friday suspended admissions from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq \u2014 throwing countless Muslim families into turmoil, and setting off a sleepless night for Rawi. \n \n\u201cThis is unbelievable. I don\u2019t know how this is possible,\u201d said Rawi, who worked in The Times\u2019 Baghdad bureau during some of the most violent years of the Iraq war. \u201cWhat\u2019s next? Is it going to be internment camps like World War II where they put all the Japanese in one camp? They\u2019ll do the same for us? This is not what this country is all about.\u201d \n \nThe executive order signed Friday suspends all refugee entries for 120 days, blocks Syrian refugees indefinitely and bars for 90 days the entry of citizens from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia. \n \nA federal judge in New York late Saturday stayed parts of the order as it applies to those currently waiting at U.S. airports for admission. For others, there remained nothing but uncertainty. \n \nAround the world, students and workers caught outside the U.S. were suddenly uncertain when they would be allowed to return. Refugees expecting safe resettlement in the U.S. were detained at airports. And families whose loved ones were stranded abroad were left in a state of crippling anxiety. \n  \n\u201cI don\u2019t understand the logic,\u201d said Moustafa Kanjo, a Syrian refugee who arrived in Pomona in September 2015. \u201cWhy would we be a security risk here? Our ultimate goal is to run away from violence.\u201d \n \nFor Rawi, the chaos began less than two hours after Trump signed the order on Friday. About 6 p.m., he received a jarring message on WhatsApp. \n \nIt was from his father. \n \nHe\u2019d been set to board a plane in Doha, Qatar, when an airline employee took his passport somewhere and returned with a U.S. Embassy representative. \n \nHe could not get on the plane, the man said. His visa \u2014 which allowed for multiple visits to the U.S. over the course of a year \u2014 was no longer valid: It was canceled by the president, he said. \n \nRawi\u2019s father was ushered to a room where he waited for several hours with about 30 other people. \n \nEventually, he was sent back to Baghdad. He returned home empty-handed; when he arrived, he found out his luggage was lost. \n \nThe younger Rawi had to find a way to tell his children that their grandfather wouldn\u2019t be coming after all. The youngest, 3-year-old Layla, had been so excited over his impending visit that she slept in the dress she had chosen to greet him. Her older brother had been too excited to sleep at all. \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d Rawi said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the inconvenience, it\u2019s not only about us being disappointed\u2026but it\u2019s about how this was all done.\u201d \n  \nAli Abdi, a 30-year-old student from Iran, has been studying for his PhD in anthropology at Yale University , and had left the U.S. last week for the United Arab Emirates on his way to a research trip in Afghanistan. \n \nNow Abdi, who has been living in the U.S. for the last four years, is unsure what to do. He cannot return to Iran, where he faces potential imprisonment for his political activism. His visa for the UAE won\u2019t allow him to stay there for long, nor does he have permission for an extended stay in Afghanistan. \n \nMost seriously, under Trump\u2019s new order, he can no longer return to the U.S. to finish his studies. \n \nAbdi is trying to be philosophical. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about anything... From an anthropological perspective I can write a lot,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhat has happened is very illuminating. The main problem is the lives of thousands of others who are torn apart by what happened.\u201d \n \nMany were scanning their social media feeds or watching television, trying to make sense of the new policy and understand what happens next. \n \nBahareh Aslani, a 34-year-old Iranian American, has been planning to have a formal wedding ceremony in Baltimore in April to celebrate her marriage to her husband, Mostapha Roudsari, who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. \n \nRoudsari\u2019s parents, who live in Iran, went to Dubai in December and applied for a visa to enter the U.S., waiting 2 ½ months for an appointment at the U.S. embassy. The couple was told that the mother\u2019s visa had been approved and that the father\u2019s visa had been approved, pending additional documents. \n \nNow, both are barred from entry and will not be able to attend the wedding and are devastated, Aslani said. \n \n\u201cIt's frustrating, most of all,\u201d Aslani said. \u201cMakes me sad for my in-laws and family, but mostly I\u2019m really scared, because is this the beginning? Are they going to come after me?\u201d \n \nEven those refugees safely settled in the U.S. were fearful that they would be unable to see family members in the future. News of Trump\u2019s order distressed Kanjo, who was expecting an uncle and cousins to arrive in a few months. \n \nKanjo and his family came to California from the Syrian city of Homs, sponsored by First Presbyterian Church of Pomona. \n \nMembers of the church, assisted by others in the community, met the family at the airport and provided them with an apartment and help to navigate the school and social services systems. \n \n\u201cThe most significant thing we did was be friends with them,\u201d Pastor Adam Donner said. \n \nWith the help of Google translate, the Kanjos and church members have spent hours in conversation. \n \n\u201cThey would all gladly go home to Syria if they had a home to go to,\u201d Donner said. \u201cThey are here because they are trying to find a safe place for their family to grow up.\u201d \n \nNobar Elmi Golhar, 36, lives in Brooklyn and has never been to Iran, but worries about whether her family in Iran will be able to continue to visit. Her aunt and uncle, both green card holders who have children in the United States, were in the U.S. when the executive order was signed, and now both are uncertain whether it\u2019s wise to go back home to Iran \u2014 they may not be allowed to return. \n \n\u201cThey are here and want to return to Iran, but now they are very worried if they can come back,\u201d Golhar said. \u201cThey are trying to better understand what is going on and watch the news and ask what they should expect.\u201d \n \nWhat they are feeling, she said, is panic.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Alene Tchekmedyian, Melissa Etehad, Harriet Ryan"},"topics":[{"name":"Sports: latest","group":"Sports"}],"title":"Families divided by Trump's refugee order worry about the future","source":{"category":"Local","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","county":"Cook","zipCode":"60654","state":"Illinois","countryCode":"US","zipArea":"Chicago","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"2","name":"Chicago Tribune","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169587602","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"0"},"name":"Chicago Tribune","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Consumer","Sports","MotorRacing"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.chicagotribune.com","publisher":"Tribune Company"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-all-things-trump/"],"sequenceId":"695195999894","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T03:30:00Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:16Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://www.trbimg.com/img-588d69e2/turbine/la-na-divided-families-20170128/600"}],"video":[]}}

Michel O'Sullivan  by Katrina King  \nThe long post-GFC economic purgatory is set to finally end as the global economy readies for take-off. \n \nDonald Trump may think it's due to him, but global manufacturing data and leading indicator charts had been shooting up, even in Europe, which has been in a long funk, before he moved into the White House. \n \nAs for the impact of America's 45th President, markets are giving some credit to \"the Trump effect.\" Good Trump \u2013 tax-cutter, deregulator, fiscal booster (he's promised to rebuild America's creaking infrastructure) and deal-making businessman would be positive for growth and paychecks. Everyone's hoping that Bad Trump \u2013 confrontational, divisive, nativist and protectionist \u2013 is kept in check. \n \nFinancial markets people live data day in, day out. Ours is a rational world and so we are prone to thinking that people take a best-interests approach. But that's not always true. Not everyone is homo economicus , infinitely making decisions in their best economic interests. \n   \nSome neurolinguistics and brain function experts have argued that many Trump voters are particularly motivated by self-definition and identity. If best-interests and rationality are absent under a Trump administration, rocky times are ahead. \n   \nMeanwhile, like others who live in the world of economics and markets, central banks are configuring for stronger growth trends. The US Federal Reserve has already flagged three rate hikes for 2017, a vote of economic confidence. \n Tighter monetary policy  \nIt's also hinting at the prospect of letting the bonds on its balance sheet roll off when they mature, rather than reinvesting the proceeds. Effectively this tightens monetary policy, irrespective of official interest rate moves. \n \nThe Bank of Japan has been acknowledging the harmful side-effects of negative interest rates on savers as well as lenders and has been reducing purchases of long-dated bonds in an effort to create a more normal yield curve \u2013 one where interest rates on 10 and 30-year bonds are higher than on three and five-year bonds. \n   \nInflation, or at least inflationary expectations, which has been the dog that didn't bark, is finally waking from a long sleep. This doesn't mean the kind of terrible inflation of the 1970s is ahead; rather the bottom of the low-inflation cycle has been reached. Whereas unusually low inflationary expectations had become anchored among businesses and consumers for much of the post-GFC era, they are now less sure. \n \nAll this uncertainty is adding to risks. Risk can get portrayed as an unsavoury four-letter world, but for active investors, it's terrific. Calculated risk creates opportunity for reward. \n \nBond investors who looked ahead bought inflation-compensating assets when they were at compelling valuations. Those investments have gone up in value as inflation expectations have risen and they are poised to rise further in value as uncertainty takes hold. \n \nInflation doesn't have to go up for such investments to gain value. Just the fact that people are less certain about future inflation boots the value of inflation-compensating assets. \n   \nInvestors are also eying corporate bonds as they would be expected to benefit from a stronger economic pulse. Corporate balance sheets, especially in the US, are in good shape, and while interest coverage is off its peaks, it remains healthy, which reassures corporate bond investors. \n Share buy-backs  \nThere's been a lot of commentary on corporate America's $US1.7 trillion cash holdings. Rather than investing to grow their businesses and create jobs, American companies have emphasised share-buybacks, higher dividends, special dividends and more recently mergers and acquisitions. That may be good for shareholders in the short run, but not so great for the country or shareholders in the longer run.  \n \nInvesting for the future drives prosperity and lifts confidence. Encouragingly, there have lately been sightings of corporate animal spirts. The US small business outlook recently registered the strongest rise in almost 40 years and surveys of future capital expenditure intentions have shot up. \n   \nEveryone is hoping that spirited intentions get translated to actual commitments. Historically, intention-surveys have proved to be accurate predictors of future spending and so there are reasons for optimism. \n \nWhile Australian growth receded in the third quarter of last year, recent data suggests a recovery in the final quarter and the first half of 2017. The housing construction cycle appears poised to be stronger for longer and the strength of public infrastructure spending is a tonic. Of course, neither can last forever, but is helping to offset the drag from the weakness of the mining sector. \n \nLike other developed countries, the inflation trough appears to have been reached and so no further interest rate cuts are anticipated. On the other hand, rate rises are some way off. \n \nLike smokers warnings, the relatively optimistic global picture needs caveats. \n   \nThe Trump phenomena caught most by surprise. More could be in store over this year as France, Germany and the Netherlands gear up for elections in which populists and nativists are expected to poll strongly. The global economic system has managed to weather any number of jolts, but there has to be some limit to its shock-absorbing capacity. \n \nKatrina King is director for research and strategy at funds manager QIC","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Brace for a bumpy road to riches","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Oceania","subregion":"Australia and New Zealand","countryCode":"AU","country":"Australia"},"editorialRank":"1","name":"Australian Financial Review","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169657143","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"5304"},"name":"Australian Financial Review","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Financials","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.afr.com","publisher":"Fairfax Media"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196008670","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:27Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

Most services, except essential ones like primary healthcare and basic education, will be covered by GST. \n \nService tax was budgeted to provide Rs 2.31 lakh crore in 2016-17, more than 14 per cent of the Centre's total tax revenues of Rs 16.30 lakh crore. \n \nThis will be the third time that Jaitley will raise service tax rate. Service tax from June 1, 2015 was hiked from 12.36 per cent to 14 per cent. A 0.5 per cent Swachh Bharat Cess was levied on all services, taking the total incidence of service tax to 14.5 per cent from November 15, 2015. \n \nIn the last Budget, he imposed a Krishi Kalyan Cess at the rate of 0.5 per cent on all taxable services to take the levy to 15 per cent.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[{"name":"Tax news","group":"Finance"},{"name":"India news","group":"Regional"},{"name":"Business latest","group":"Business"}],"title":"FM Jaitley May Hike Service Tax to 16-18% in Budget","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Asia","subregion":"Southern Asia","countryCode":"IN","country":"India"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"News18.com","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"590783480","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"31"},"name":"News18.com","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Business","Professional"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.news18.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196023511","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:35Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

The standards will save consumers tens of billions of dollars at the pump, will help ensure that domestic automakers continue to be at the forefront of global advances in auto technology, and are essential to keeping the United States on course to meet its climate goals. \n \nEPA\u2019s determination affirming the standards through MY 2025 is part of the \u201cmidterm evaluation\u201d required under the 2012 rule setting standards for MY 2017-2025. For many years, automakers had emphasized the critical importance of adequate lead time for achieving substantial increases in fuel economy and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, they voiced concern that standards set well in advance might overshoot the levels that would seem appropriate as the model years approached. Yet vehicle efficiency technology advances are now in fact outpacing the agencies\u2019 earlier projections, and EPA\u2019s action should allow the highly successful program of vehicle standards to proceed as planned. \n \nThe agency\u2019s determination is based upon a thorough draft Technical Assessment Report (TAR) issued last July by EPA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and the California Air Resources Board, as well as stakeholders\u2019 comments on the TAR and EPA follow-up work. The analysis shows that the standards are still achievable and cost-effective despite lower oil prices, partly due to the emergence of technologies not contemplated in the compliance packages the agencies constructed for the 2012 rulemaking. Taken together, increases in vehicle standards for the period MY 2012-2025 will nearly double the fuel efficiency of cars and light-trucks relative to MY 2010. \n \nThe American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy acts as a catalyst to advance energy efficiency policies, programs, technologies, investments, and behaviors.","author":{"publishingPlatform":{},"name":"Barb Hansen"},"topics":[{"name":"Energy industry news","group":"Industry"}],"title":"EPA Takes Appropriate Next Step on Vehicle Standards","source":{"category":"Trade","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Energy Central","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"169693246","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"19"},"name":"Energy Central","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Professional","Energy"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://www.energycentral.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":[],"sequenceId":"695196026643","language":"English","publishedDate":"2017-01-29T05:20:11Z","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:36Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[],"video":[]}}

My father served in England during World War II. A family friend was an American agent in Berlin. It was no surprise I spent a childhood fascinated by espionage, Spy versus Spy in Mad Magazine and the CIA.  \n \nWhat I didn\u2019t know was that the father of the CIA had a summer home in Nonquitt.  \n \nCol. Wild Bill Donovan was what we don\u2019t have many of currently \u2014 an authentic American hero.  \n \nThe CIA website has 220 articles detailing his career. Their biography of him notes:  \n \nDonovan was the only American to have received the nations four highest awards: the Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Distinguished Service Medal, and the National Security Medal. After his death, Donovan was awarded the Freedom Award of the International Rescue Committee. He is also a member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame.  \n \nIn June 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt established the Office of Strategic Services, the OSS. It was the predecessor of the CIA. Col. Donovan, a World War I hero, lawyer and student of Europe became director. He already was a close friend of Winston Churchill and Sir William Stephenson, head of the British espionage effort that among other things broke German codes. The president had been using him as an unofficial agent.  \n \nDonovan oversaw 7,500 agents overseas during the war. Of those, 900 were women; 116 OSS agents died. The OSS had everyone from historians to baseball players and lawyers working for them. Their job was to collect information and act on it. They knew about the plot to assassinate Hitler. They discovered his plans for the bomb.  \n \nIt was Donovan\u2019s wife, Ruth Rumsey Donovan, who brought her family to South Dartmouth. Her father had been one of the richest men in America. Her money financed a very WASP lifestyle for Donovan, an Irish guy from Buffalo who was supposed to become a priest. The priesthood could never have held Donovan.  \n \nIn 1928, according to Donovan\u2019s biographer, Douglas Waller, \u201cRuth also later bought a sprawling lodge in the upper class resort village of Nonquitt, Massachusetts. It had nine bedrooms and a wide front porch that offered a perfect view of Buzzards Bay. Nonquitt became her and the children\u2019s refuge from Washington\u2019s oppressive heat each summer. Donovan at first spent many weekends there, sailing and playing tennis but soon tapered off because he found the beach house boring.\u201d It remained in the Donovan family until 1979.  \n \nWilliam J. Donovan died on Feb. 8, 1959 at 76. On Nov. 3, 1959, his widow was brought in a black limousine out to the countryside of Langley, Virginia. That day President Dwight David Eisenhower laid the cornerstone of CIA headquarters. Under the cornerstone is a box of CIA founding material including: \n \nMemorandum for President Franklin D. Roosevelt from Major General William J. Donovan, director of the Office of Strategic Services, dated Nov. 18, 1944, regarding the establishment of a permanent centralized intelligence service.  \n \nThe CIA does not forget their own. The stars and names mean something, An OSS Gallery is inside the agency museum.  \n \nThe exhibition catalog notes: \n \nA statue of Maj. Gen. William J. Donovan stands in solemn watch next to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Memorial \u2026 Donovan is responsible for developing the five principles of the CIA:  \n \n\u2022 Be an independent agency, \n \n\u2022 Be able to do overt and covert action, \n \n\u2022 Set the tone for how intelligence would be gathered in the community, \n \n\u2022 Coordinate all the intelligence community, and \n \n\u2022 Have no police powers.  \n \nThe memorial recognizes OSS agents killed during their service. There is a recreation of Wild Bill\u2019s office \u2014 desk, medals, map case.  \n \nSymbolically, visitors then step from Donovan\u2019s office into a busy hallway of present-day CIA.  \n \nWhile I was writing this column, I found that Wild Bill Donovan lives on not just at Langley, but in films, television series and more. Beginning with Michael Cabin\u2019s novel, Moonglow, a brilliant fiction based on his grandfather\u2019s life, I found Donovan.

Influenced by Billie Holiday, she also wrote lyrics and composed numbers. Her first album was in \u201856 but for me the first big breakout album was in \u201861 with Straight Ahead on the Candid label. A very beautiful lady; she was married from 61-70 to Max Roach, the drummer and co-conspirator with Charlie Parker in those early days of be bop. She was still recording up until 2007 3 years before her death at 80. \n\nA worthy obituary is here: https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/aug/15/abbey-lincoln-obituary \n\nI liked her and so does JD ! \n\nAnd I lied about videos, only from now on this has to be audio only. \n\nThis is later in life and very good quality: \n\nNorma Winstone was born in Bow East London in \u201841, so can claim to be a real cockney. Most of her earlier work is what I like but everyone to their own. A lyricist as well as a singer, she started with bands in the Dagenham area and went from there, and has worked with many European and American artists. \n\nRene Marie: born in the USA in \u201855, she did not start a professional career until she was 42 ! After getting married at 18 she raised two children and when she started singing her husband gave her an ultimatum: stop singing or go; she chose the music path ! There are quite a few videos of Rene but all have dubious sound so once again indulge me: \n\nDiana Krall: in modern times this lady has been hugely successful, often her music wanders into cross over territory and is not jazz as I/we know it, but very accomplished. Born in Canada in \u201864 she had eight albums, more than anybody else at the top of female jazz artists in Billboard; a record. \n\nAnita O\u2019Day: became world famous overnight for her performance in the Newport Jazz Festival film Jazz on a Summers Day. Born in 1919, the year would suggest she should have been in the first list and career-wise yes, but to the likes of us her performance in that film was the start of her public acknowledgment. \n\nHer early unhappy home life meant she left at 14 and did all sorts of strange things to earn a living including dance marathons. She was a capable drummer and married one, so as with so many of that era her background meant she could cope with anything that came up. \n\nIn \u201841 Gene Krupa asked her to join his band and that was followed with stints with Woody Herman and Stan Kenton. She had a drug problem all her life and admitted she was probably high during that famous Newport \u201858 film. Considering the drug abuse, something she discussed in detail in a documentary, it was a miracle she made 87, but she was someone who never forgot her Jazz roots. \n\nHere at Newport \u201858: \n\nFairly new to me is Silje Nergaard, born in \u201866 in Norway. It was this album that projected her onto a world stage, with Pat Methany on guitar: \n\nAs with all lists nothing is definitive, and sadly some that would have been included were not, either because of nothing of note being available or what there was being obscure numbers, bad sound etc, so forgiveness for not including obvious favourites and jazz greats such as Lena Horne, Betty Carter et al. \n\n_____________________________________ \n\nWiggia\u2019s first Ladies of Jazz is here","author":{"publishingPlatform":{}},"topics":[],"title":"Ladies of Jazz 2, by Wiggia","source":{"category":"National","location":{"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","countryCode":"US","country":"United States"},"editorialRank":"3","name":"Before It's News","feed":{"genre":"General","tags":[],"id":"557901141","inWhiteList":"true","rank":{"inboundLinkCount":"326"},"name":"Before It's News","dataFormat":"text","autoTopics":[],"language":"Unassigned","editorialTopics":["Geographic","National","Standard","News"],"mediaType":"News"},"homeUrl":"http://beforeitsnews.com"},"dataFormat":"text","outboundUrls":["https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/aug/15/abbey-lincoln-obituary"],"sequenceId":"695196033687","language":"English","adultLanguage":"false","harvestDate":"2017-01-29T07:26:39Z","media":{"logo":[],"audio":[],"images":[{"url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Bearwatch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA"}],"video":[]}}

Also out of cabinet is Liberal MLC John Ajaka, who was minister for ageing, disability services and multiculturalism. However, Mr Ajaka is set to become President of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn strategic appointments with an eye on the crucial electoral battleground of western Sydney, two new MPs from the area, Mulgoa's Tanya Davies and Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, have been elevated to cabinet.\n\nMs Berejiklian has also created the new portfolio of minister for WestConnex, to be held by Penrith MP Stuart Ayres, who is also minister for western Sydney.\n\nThe move is being seen as an attempt to reset the discussion about the $16.8 billion road project from complaints about the disruption of inner-Sydney communities to the benefits it will bring commuting western Sydney families.\n\nAnother surprise announcement is the new position of minister for counter terrorism which Ms Berejiklian said was necessary \"unfortunately due to the circumstances our world is in\".\n\nLiberal MP David Elliott \u2013 a leader of the centre-right faction that supported Ms Berejiklian's election as Liberal leader and premier after the retirement from politics of former premier Mike Baird \u2013 adds the role to his existing portfolio area of corrections.\n\nIt will involve liaising with state, Commonwealth and international counter terrorism bodies.\n\nUnveiling the new cabinet, Ms Berejiklian repeated the pledge that her government would listen, consult and act and \"wants to make sure every single community across NSW gets its fair share\".\n\nMr Piccoli will be replaced in education by Rob Stokes, whose planning portfolio will be taken over by former industry and energy minister Anthony Roberts.\n\nMr Roberts, a leader of the right faction whose numbers also supported Ms Berejiklian's election, also becomes special minister of state.\n\nNationals MP for Oxley Melinda Pavey enters cabinet to take over the roads portfolio from Mr Gay, while her party colleague Sarah Mitchell has been promoted to the ministry to take on early childhood education and Aboriginal affairs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners are two of Ms Berejiklian's strongest supporters in her own left faction: former Legislative Council president Don Harwin and Hornsby MP and former parliamentary secretary Matt Kean.\n\nMr Harwin comes into cabinet as energy and resources minister and minister for the arts.\n\nHe has also been appointed leader of the government in the Legislative Council. Mr Kean enters cabinet as minister for innovation and better regulation.\n\nMr Harwin and Mr Kean were key to engineering the numbers to have Ms Berejiklian elected leader.\n\nIn other Nationals promotions Adam Marshall will head tourism and major events, which has been taken from Mr Ayres.\n\nDeputy Nationals leader and primary industries and water minister Niall Blair picks up the trade portfolio from Mr Ayres and the key jobs portfolio of industry from Mr Roberts.\n\nFormer deputy premier and Nationals leader Troy Grant has held onto police and adds emergency services to his responsibilities.\n\nFormer local government minister Paul Toole becomes minister for lands and forestry as well as racing.\n\nPru Goward moves from mental health and women to her former portfolio of family and community services.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep.

Kennedy International Airport Friday and Saturday, including two Iraqis with ties to the US military who had been granted visas to enter the United States. \n \nThe ruling does not necessarily mean the people being held at airports across the US are going to be released, said Zachary Manfredi, from Yale's Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, who helped draft the emergency stay motion. \n \n\"The judge's order is that they (lawful visa/green card holders) not be removed from the US -- it doesn't immediately order that they be released from detention,\" he told CNN. \n \n\"We are hoping that CBP (Customs and Border Patrol), now that they no longer have a reason to detain them, will release them. But it is also possible they could be transferred to (other) detention facilities.\" \n \n\"We are getting the order to as many CBP officers as possible right now,\" he added. \n \nThe United States denied entry to 109 travelers heading to the country at the time the ruling was signed, a Department of Homeland Security official said. The agency would not say how many of them were sent already home and how many were detained. \n \nACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero praised the ruling, saying \"our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court.\" \n \nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, who argued the case, said the ruling \"preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off U.S. soil.\" \n \nLawsuit is first challenge to executive order \n \nThe class-action lawsuit is the first legal challenge to Trump's controversial executive order, which indefinitely suspends admissions for Syrian refugees and limits the flow of other refugees into the United States by instituting what the President has called \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \n \nThe two Iraqis, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkaleq Alshawi, had been released by Saturday night. But lawyers for other detained travelers said in a court filing that \"dozens and dozens\" of individuals remained held at JFK. \n \nSimilar legal actions had been initiated in other states.. \n \nA federal court in Washington state issued a stay forbidding travelers being detained there from being sent back to their home country. \n \nA federal court in Virginia has issued a temporary restraining order saying several dozen permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and these residents cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. \n \nTrump's order, signed Friday, bars travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, to the US for 90 days. It also suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated \"only for nationals of countries for whom\" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted. \n \nReleased under special circumstances \n \nAccording to court papers, both Darweesh and Alshawi were legally allowed to come into the US but were detained in accordance with Trump's order. \n \nDarweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the US during the Iraq War, was released from detention early Saturday afternoon. \n \n\"America is the land of freedom,\" he told reporters at the airport shortly after his release. \"America is the greatest nation.\" \n \nA source with knowledge of the case confirmed Darweesh will be allowed into the US due to provisions in Trump's order that allow the State and Homeland Security departments to admit individuals into the US on a case-by-case base for certain reasons, including when the person is already in transit and it would cause undue hardship and would not pose a threat to the security of the US. \n \nThe suit said Darweesh held a special immigrant visa, which he was granted the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20, due to his work for the US government from 2003 to 2013. \n \nAlshawi was released Saturday night, according to his attorney, Mark Doss. \n \nRep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, who had arrived at JFK by early Saturday afternoon to try and secure the release of the two Iraqis, railed against Trump's order and pledged continued action. \n \n\"This should not happen in America,\" Velazquez said following Darweesh's release. \"One by one, street by street, if we have to go to court, we will fight this anyplace, anywhere.\" \n \n'The executive order is unlawful' \n \nThe lawsuit said the US granted Alshawi a visa earlier this month to meet with his wife and son, whom the US already granted refugee status for her association with the US military. \n \nThe lawyers for the two men called for a hearing because they maintain the detention of people with valid visas is illegal. \n \n\"Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights,\" the lawyers argue in court papers. \n \nCourt papers said Customs and Border Protection authorities did not allow the lawyers to meet with the men and told them to try reaching Trump.
